0,"> In 1961, Maurice Papon was personally awarded the Legion of Honour by French President Charles de Gaulle

> Papon was also in charge of the Paris police during the February 1962 massacre at the Charonne metro station, which took place during an anti-Organisation armée secrète (OAS) demonstration that had been organised by the French Communist Party (PCF). 

> Forced to resign in 1967 after the suspicious forced disappearance of the Moroccan Marxist Mehdi Ben Barka, he was supported by de Gaulle in being named as president of Sud Aviation company, which co-created the Concorde plane.

Interesting fact about the Organisation Armée Secrète. Until the Bataclan massacre the OAS was responsible for the [1961 Vitry-Le-François train bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Vitry-Le-Fran%C3%A7ois_train_bombing) the worst terrorist attack on French soil ever until the Bataclan massacre and which was completely censored by the French state because it was carried out by elements of the French military."

>Milne occasionally visited his father when the elder Milne became ill. After his father died, Milne never returned to Cotchford Farm. His mother eventually sold the farm and moved back to London, after disposing of his father's personal possessions. Milne, who did not want any part of his father's royalties, decided to write a book about his childhood. As Milne describes it, that book, The Enchanted Places, ""combined to lift me from under the shadow of my father and of Christopher Robin, and to my surprise and pleasure I found myself standing beside them in the sunshine able to look them both in the eye.""[9]

68,"Originally he was writing about a different animal than a bear, pooh was the nickname of a swan. Then he switched to a bear because of Winnie and for whatever reason the swan's nickname became what Winnie the bear was."

79,Yup. And no it doesn't really make sense but that's what happened. Pooh the swan became Winnie the Pooh. I assume that he left in the Pooh as a little Easter egg for himself and his son.

86,I spent time reading this so I feel obliged to comment
87,"_Generally_, when you spent time, money, or effort on a problem, you reduce the amount of time, money, or effort left to actually solve the problem.

I say, ""I will spent $20 and 30 minutes to finish this steak"", then I pay for it (or commit to paying for it) and spend 15 minutes eating it.  Now I only need to expend 15 more minutes, and no more money, to achieve my original goal. 

Of course, it frequently happens that I gain more information, either about the total cost of the solution or its value, as I am working on it (like ""this steak isn't that good"") or my goal shifts (I am naturally not as hungry as I was).

The sunk-cost fallacy only comes into play when I disregard those changes and focus only my original estimates and my expenditures against those estimates."

93,"I read your comment, and took the time to do it, so I felt the need to respond as well.....

94,To go box?
95,"So imagine you have a dying car, you spend $300 to fix something on it, next week another thing goes bad but it will cost you $500, you decide to pay for it because you just spent $300 on it and don't want to lose that money. A couple months later the same thing happens and you pay even more money, eventually a problem comes up that's more expensive then it would be to get a new car so you end up buying a new car and you've now lost at least $800 instead of $300 because of the sunk cost you put in. When making a decision you shouldn't let previous costs related to that choice play a factor into your choice because the money is already gone you're not going to get any back from throwing more money at the problem. With your food once you've bought it, it doesn't really matter where it goes from a financial stand point, you're not going to gain anything by overeating so why make yourself uncomfortable?"
96,I've only run into that at buffets.
97,"I read both of your comments, wrote the time off as a waste, and then commented of my own free will and ambition"
98,"Instead of adding to the discussion, I'm leaving you both with a supportive upvote."

129,"Jesus. You’re making it worse. 

But - charcuterie sounds like a really good hobby. I would try if I could build a special room for it - and go to Italy to get some of that sweet sweet bacteria."
130,"Yeah, the curing part isn't really that hard, and I haven't done any of that fancy fermented stuff with bacteria, just salt-curing with a few herbs, but I do have access to a cold-smoker (though even that's not essential - depends what you like) and have somewhere to hang it to dry and stuff."
131,"You might enjoy curing salmon, too."
132,"Oh, definitely, if only I had a ready source of salmon. I've heard it's done very quickly, and smoking it doesn't take long either if you want to do that."

161,"If I was just running out of gas toward the end, it would be awesome if my hometown was in the last leg of the race."
162,"Another rule from the Tour de France Code of Honour:

If the rider with the yellow jersey is having problems (like a crash or other isues), everyone must slow down. Nobody is allowed to take advantage of this."
163,For some silly reason I thought Pro cyclists just pissed themselves as they were riding or they wouldn't have to pee because they were sweating so much.
164,"Since a lot of people don't get this, here's some extra info..

The point is that it's not a rule, it's a decision the riders made between them to make racing outcomes more tactic/strength based. No one wants to win or loose a 3 week race because of equipment failure.

What you have to realise is that with so many teams; different classifications to race for; and different daily race profiles, you need to have allies on other teams sometimes. For example, to help in a breakaway or to ride down a breakaway, or sometimes even to get spare equipment. You won't get this if you ride like an inconsiderate, selfish asshole."
165,"It's my understanding that the peloton, as a group, will stop for pee breaks as needed. We just never see it on the broadcast because they choose to run other segments when this is going on."
166,"I think those rules only apply to the Peloton. If there’s a guy 10 minutes ahead from the Peloton, there’s no way in hell he’s gonna stop and wait 10 minutes for the hometown guy to lead the tour through his hometown, especially on day 20 of the Tour."
167,"Maybe they should do better about following the written rules about cheating/doping. 

This is cool though."
168,Hmmm I always assumed they just pissed while cycling...
169,Here's an example from the 2017 TdF: https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/8/15941498/tour-de-france-rider-pikachu-wave
170,?? This makes no sense to me. It's a competition. How can you have rules that make people give up their edge or their momentum? Its definitely gonna affect the outcome.
171,Those moments in some Tours when some riders had to poop and became famous all over Europe because they put that on TV...and you don't see anyone stoping...
172,"Also, they all do steroids together for fairness"
173,"Big fan of the tour, did not know that. That's awesome!"
174,"Ah yes, the unwritten rules of surrendering the lead position"
175,Another if the 'unwritten rules' is: everyone cheats. All the time.
176,I just went to the back of the pace line or Pelton and pissed off the bike staying in the draft.
177,"Cycling is one of those sports that has unwritten rules for just about everything:

www.velominati.com"
178,Does this rule count for anyone born in Paris?
179,Yet more reason not to take the thing seriously. Rampant steroid use and a predetermined outcome pretty much every race. Shit is faker than WWE.
180,This.. doesnt sound legit for a sport  where people  change their body chemistry for a .0002 second advantage..

184,"*""I'm just gonna take a piss at home, guys! I feel more comfortable there!""*"
185,Dont they do it in segments and add up day to day segments?
186,"Yeah, and then the team director chews you out because you have 16 more days until Paris."
187,Man I love integrity in sports.
188,Why yellow jersey?
189,"How the fuck does that make sense? If you have a problem, that's part of the race, and you deal with it. Making everyone else slow down is stupid."
190,Isn’t the rule not ‘slowing down’ but actually ‘not attacking’ (which is something different) when the yellow jersey has an issue ?
191,Which has been broken numerous times
192,That's a silly rule.
193,"Sometimes they do. If you’re in a breakaway, you ain’t stopping to pee. They don’t piss themselves though, they just pull up the bottom of their shorts and let fly.

Edit: when you got to poop tho, you gotta [poop](https://youtu.be/Br2fsbH9sy8)"
194,"I assumed they did too since SCUBA divers do alll the time. As my diving instructor put it, there are two types of people: those who pee in their wetsuits and those who lie about it."

198,">No one wants to win or loose

Or lose"
199,"So what you're saying is it isn't actually a competition, and more of a friendly bike ride amongst friends."
200,"I agree. This doesn't seem like something we would see in most competitive sports, although most of my sports watching is american football, basketball, and hockey. Home field is usually an advantage enough but to let them have the lead in the hometown would have to have an effect on the outcome. Somebody is going to have to explain how this helps competitive play."
201,Makes sense. Letting a guy move 20 meters up to lead the race is a little different than everyone stopping for several minutes.
202,"yeah i think its only for the group/cluster. Like if you can see the guy, let him be in front for this stretch."
203,Doping would be part of the unwritten rules.
204,The thing is I don’t think they could safely do the tour at the modern pace without the drugs; their bodies would not be able to handle it.
205,"Cycling is pretty much top of the game for doping control. The reason you hear about it, is precisely because they’re doing something about it."
206,"They do, you just can't pedal when you do it. You need a nice long shallow gradient and a nice stretchy pair of bib-shorts."
207,You don't win from crossing the finish line at the end. All your times get averaged out at each stage. IIRC it's 21 stages and usually takes 23 days to finish. It's not a non stop race.
208,"You're clueless and shouldn't comment. Steroids are not a problem in cycling. Doping is and while not impossible, it is extremely difficult to get away with it under today's rules.

A cyclist will get suspended for having no drugs in their system and a high red cell blood count. They do this by extracting their very healthy / rich blood during the off-season and then during a major tour they'll do a blood transfusion to increase their red cell blood count that has been reduced over days / weeks of racing.

Do some research before commenting next time, makes you look ignorant if you don't."
209,Steroids are really not that beneficial for cycling. The actual effective drugs are the ones that boost hematocrit.
210,The winner of the classification is the rider with the most points at the end of the Tour. Not just who teaches the goal first
211,i would feel the need to rent a porto potty and have them at certain places only i could use.
212,Number two!
213,I can only shit at priceless moments!
214,"Yeah, and the article says the hometown hero only gets to be in the front of the peloton (the main group riding together), not the front of the whole race. So if there's a few riders who pulled out ahead of the pack it's not like they need to come back and give the guy the lead. It wouldn't actually affect the standing much since everyone in the peloton is essentially on the same pace anyway for that stage."
215,Integrity is not a term often used when writing about the Tour de France. 😕
216,"That's not really integrity...I dunno what it is but it's silly.... Crashes and mechanical issues affect everyone.. why slow down just because it's #1? They don't do the for anyone else?   Is it a race, or a parade ? ( yes I know about the final stage)"
217,Randy Marsh approves of all forms of tegridy.
218,"But also hgh, epo, roids and blood doping."
219,"Integrity? This doesn't seem like integrity, it just seems lame. To me the appeal of sports is people doing everything they can to win. It's competition in a relatively consequence free (compared to, say, war) arena. Stuff like this just makes me roll my eyes and wonder why a ""rule"" breaker hasn't taken advantage of it yet for a marginal gain. If you aren't trying to optimize your performance why are you competing?"
220,Integrity and cycling. Lol

224,The first Tour de France was a one off race that was originally sponsored by a magazine which had a yellow cover. It was a kind of advertising for them. The tradition has carried on for the race leader.
225,"Its an unwritten rule so you could take advantage if u really wanted

The motive behind this though is that winning because the leader had an equipment malfunction or something isnt the same as winning because you are the faster rider."
226,It's a good way to defend an attack.
227,"now, peeing into a drysuit, that is another chapter entirely..."
228,"The hometown thing is a non-issue. It’s just someone coming to the front of the pack for a few minutes. Pro cycling team riders all have assigned tasks - once out of a given rider’s hometown, they’ll resume their duties. They’re not going to be busting ass ahead of the pack - and if you follow pro cycling at all, you’ll know breakaways get caught more often than not."
229,As in any top level sport
230,The modern pace was dictated by the cheating/doping. So if that could be irradiated then you would be at a normal pace.
231,Armstrong got away with it over 7 years. Just saying.
232,Ah that makes sense alright
233,Or a teammate to push you along. Being a domestique is no joke.
234,Or a teammate to push you along. Being a domestique is no joke.
235,Because it’s logistically impossible to try to maintain a three week race. They have to sleep and eat and shower.
236,"everyone in the Peloton gets the same ""time"" as the first guy in the Peloton.  This is to prevent a massive sprint in sight of the goal with 30+ bicyclists, it would just always end in a crash.

So yea they just let him be in the front."
237,"There are unwritten rules, for example, doping is part of the sport, but putting an electric motor in your bike is verboten."
238,"What’s interesting is that the omertà around doping in the Tour actually is about some kind of integrity: but integrity to the athletes because it was considered impossible to get through the race without help. But I get what you’re saying, for sure."
239,"Here we go, another redditor who doesn't own a bike is going to tell everyone how horrible a sport, he's never participated on level in, is."
240,"Actually, if you're in the back and have bike issues, they will just take away the time you spent disabled.  The whole sport is rather odd. It is not like a normal race at all"
241,"How I see it; if that person is currently the best cyclist in the race(we don't know the new best racer until the end of the race) and it you and him, neck and neck, then through a one in a million chance he his chain fails. Then you win, but can you really say you were the better racer?

Maybe you can, but that's not the whole story. Imagine you are the champion, you're beating the second place guy by a fair few meters. Then it is your chain that fails, and you lose to that second place man. Is he really the better racer?

Fundamentally, the competition is between who is the better racer not who has a better luck."
242,"It's not always true, it depends on the context. If the race is heated then they won't wait for him nor anyone else. I'd say the race shouldn't become heated because of the incident. It's like a moral thing."
243,"To be clear, the unwritten rule is that it's ot cool to attack after someone has a mechanical. However if rivals are already fighting each other then a mechanical at that point is fair game. The riders do not want to win on a technicality, they want to show they are the strongest rider(team)."
244,"It applies to every team leader. So Froome, Banal, Duomolin, those type of guys, will not be able to crash out of a race. However, the supporting riders usually does not get that treat.

Note: This does not apply to situations where the race is going on. So if you crash when there's a sidewind on flat road (which is a situation where teams always push the pace) or you get a mechanical when a leader is attacking, though luck. For an example of how these unwritten rules interact, see stage 12 of the 2016 Tour de France, [covered at the 2:20 mark of this video ](https://youtu.be/ZP_Qo4qN97k)"
245,It's a mix of both. I can't decide if I like that or not.
246,"You win the race with your legs, not when the leader’s bike breaks. If you attack and force the leader into a crash or a mechanical problem, that’s fair game though."
247,It's not entertaining to lose out on good racing because the strongest man got a flat tire. You don't know what you're talking about.
248,why isn't the person in front called the leader?
249,"But if you had an equipment malfunction in 2nd place, fuck off?

or had an equipment malfunction in the previous race to make you not the leader?"
250,"But you were the faster rider, that day."
251,"But you were the faster rider, that day."
252,"So to be clear, if we expose the doping measures to radiation, the riders will agree to a normal pace, where normal is defined as a pace that is not modern. Got it."
253,Didn’t the other 200 or so people below him as well?
254,"Yeah, and cycling actually has strong controls. The other sports simply don't give a shit because it's more profitable to let them juice."
255,"The American team started doping when they realized the europeans doped as a matter of course. 

I think the idea that ""Lance Armsrtrong doped!"" is a bit specious. 

I also think it's amazing how like practically everyone in the US became an expert on men's professional cycling overnight when the scandal broke. It was really something to behold."
256,And holding on to water bottles coming out of your support car so you don't have to peddle is fine
257,"I feel they should just making doping an official part of the sport. It's ridiculous that riders can take advantage of advancements in material sciences like carbon fiber bikes, aero helmets and advancements in nutrition but aren't allowed to use bio chemistry? 

Why not? Professional cycling is already insanely dangerous so if you're willing to go the extra step and play with your body chemistry more power to you."
258,"> impossible to get through the race without help

Slower but not impossible."
259,"It's not really who is the best, it's who has the best race. That's why it's so fun. And really, it's which team has the best race."
260,"You have a point, but isn't equipment part of the story? Isn't part of being a good bicyclist maintaining your bike? Also avoiding potholes and other racers, all the things that can cause issues? Isn't it more than pedaling the fastest? If you were carrying the vital information à la 1917 and your bike broke down, thousands could die. ""For want of a nail ...the war was lost."""
261,"Well it could be who slept better, so should you not race until you both had a good night sleep? Or what if one of you had a bad dream etc. There are a million things that impact the outcome, It's tough to say if both are ever actually at 100%. Going on a long enough race you imagine the random variants should be somewhat accounted for just by the distance."
262,"But mechanical issues are the crew's part of the race. The crew let you down, so you lose."
263,"When someone's car breaks down in an auto race, it's generally accepted that the equipment is part of the racer."
264,"Breakdowns affect everyone, except the leader?   Is this also common in The Giro and other big races?"
265,"Morals in the Tour de France? Ha, ha, ha! You're kidding right?

How's the drug testing going?"
266,Part of competition is luck.
267,The race takes more than two weeks. They are not on their bikes 24/7 and you need to be able to tell who made the best progress over several stages.
268,Because it's a multi day race and your time is cumulative over all the days. So the person in front on any given day might not be the one actually leading the overall time.
269,"They will do the same. The reality is there are probably fewer than 5 riders that could win the race on an average year and normally 2 or 3   realistically. It's a race between them. 

The daily races can be won by anyone."
270,The race lasts a month. It's the overall leader you don't pass on a mechanical failure. If you want to win today's race you can go as fast as you want.
271,The riders won’t have to agree to anything. You said yourself that without doping they can’t perform the modern pace. Take out the doping and the normal pace will be whatever their normal bodies allow.
272,Yeah that’s my point
273,"In tennis for example you can just hide in your panic room to avoid random testing.

No sport has strong controls. Some are just stronger than others."
274,"*pedal

Peddle means to sell or try to sell/promote a product."
275,Is that a thing?
276,I've been saying it for years: just make leagues for sports where that kind of stuff is *mandatory*.
277,Just getting the point across. Was a competitive cyclist for 15 years.
278,"> It's not really who is the best, it's who has the best pharmacist. That's why it's so fun. And really, it's which team has the best pharmacist.

FTFY"
279,They have dedicated team mechanics but shit still happens.
280,Or who can afford the best bike chain? Team? Dope?
281,"I believed Lance for far too long... Now I just think old heroes beat the tests and new ones have better ways to avoid detection.
Unfortunately"
282,"Oh please, people need to shut the fuck up about doping. Every sport has doping if money is involved. Get off your high horse."
283,"i dont get it, so its not whoever gets to X first, wins?"
284,"Do you know what doping is? It's very hard to catch, is not necessarily related to drug use, and cycling has put in a number of controls to prevent it. You have to test almost everyday to catch it because an athlete can have a red blood cell count consistent for days and then a sudden spike, no drugs in their system. What exactly would you do to improve that process besides point out that it is a problem?"
285,Right and that's part of the excitement of the race. You eat and train correctly before the race but you could still pull a muscle during the race. Shit happens. Why stop the race when shit happens?
286,There are rules on the bikes and they can't be lighter than they already are for example so you don't need a 5 million dollar bike to win.
287,"I don't hold it against Lance very much. It's not like the guys he was competing against weren't also doping.  The guys who won before him most certainly were doping, they just didn't get caught because testing wasn't sophisticated."
288,found lance's dealer
289,"It's a perfectly normal response to a comment staying that the race has a ""morality"" component."
290,That would be true for an individual stage but the person who wins the Tour de France is the person who has the lowest cumulative time across all stages.  They basically ride 21 races in 23 days and the person with the lowest total time wins.  It's like a whole season of a car racing league in 3 weeks.
291,"The tour is divided into 21 stages. At every stage your time between start and finish is recorded. All the times are added together and the winner of the tour is the one with the lowest time.

The yellow jersey is worn by whoever has the lowest time total at the beginning of any stage (no one wears it the first day).

There's also prizes for winning individual stages."
292,"I hold it against him because he destroyed the lives of other people to support his lies. The doping i could forgive, his behaviour surrounding it was awful"

295,"~~NSFW~~ fair warning for his Wikipedia page. Kurten loved drinking blood and was a sick psychopath.

Just warning people as it has graphic descriptions of corpse mutilation and murder."
296,"There is some anecdotal evidence that a decapitated person may have several seconds of awareness before death. Modern physicians believe most of these anecdotes are just a case of reflexive muscle twitching and you might get 2-3 seconds *at most* before losing consciousness. I don't know how loud blood gushing is or how much ambient noise/head falling sound could cover it up. Plus when you're rapidly losing consciousness, your awareness at the tail end of your seconds would be significantly diminished."
297,NSFW is a tag that people put on images/ videos that are not safe for work. Nothing about this serial killer's wikipedia page is NSFW.
298,It's for people who don't want to read graphic descriptions of a guy murdering people. Just a fair warning. :P

I, on the other hand, love the stories of serial killers xD"
300,"But NSFW is a tag that people use for things that are inappropriate for work so that others know the content could potentially get them in trouble.

301,"I work for a surveillance company.

303,I didn't say the boss would say anything. But the kind of stuff they talk to us about definitely includes what you're looking at on your phone. You may not be openly chastised but you will be judged.
304,People judge other people about everything. The tag NSFW has a purpose.
305,"That's equivocation.

If someone sees you reading a wiki page about ice cream they're less likely to judge you than if you're all about them serial killers.

So yes, people do judge for everything. But they judge you differently based on the content. People would certainly judge me if I wore pink shorts to work but they would judge me differently if I had a book on my desk about Ted Bundy.

That's common sense. Or at least I thought so until your response. Feels weird having to explain it."
306,"Bro, if someone sees you looking at dick pics at work you can get fired. Dick pics are NSFW.

If some uptight person sees you looking at a wiki for a serial killer, or listening to a true crime podcast, they might judge you, but they can't file an HR complaint.

NSFW is for things about which an HR complaint could likely be filed. As such they are unsafe for work.

A person judging you doesn't make something NSFW."

318,"> I could've sworn New York City was south of Rome and New Orleans was on the same line of latitude as Saudi Arabia. Far from cold and moist.

NYC is roughly the same latitude as Rome, so south of Paris, London, etc., but latitude is only part of the equation when calculating climate. Outside of being hot, New Orleans is in no way similar to Riyadh - the Deep South is a humid swamp.

The theory was more about political calculus than anything else: by claiming that America was this worthless place, the monarchies of Europe were hoping to stem the flow of emigration from their countries and revolution within their countries that would follow the American Revolution, in Europe. It was in direct contrast to the concept of the 'American Dream' (all this space would allow a person to grow and flourish freely)."

>Hi Steve:

>I'm from Dallas, TX. A few years ago I had bought my ticket to see Pete Best in Oklahoma City (which is about 3 hrs driving North of Dallas); the day of the concert **I drove up there and to my surprise, there was a note on the doors of the venue saying that the concert had been cancelled**. I assumed it was because of poor sales... This year, I was excited that Pete Best is now on tour and that he had scheduled a show in Dallas, TX (May 10th)! So, I got my ticket and was ready for the concert and today I got an email from the people from the Granada Theater saying that the show is being cancelled! Not again!! For the 2nd time! This is the text from the email I got:

>>""We are very sorry to have to inform you that **Pete Best has cancelled his May 10, 2006 performance at the Granada Theater**. It's always hard for us to accept, to all the fans we're very sorry, our anticipation of this special concert was very high as well. Very recent changes in laws with passports caused the cancellation and they are working to get a date re-scheduled at Granada as soon as the passports are up to date. You will be receiving a refund on your credit card for the full ticket price. We will be refunding all service charges as well. We are working with the agent to reschedule as soon as possible, however no date is set as of yet. Thank you for understanding, we appreciate your support of the Granada.

Sadly it would have to be Guns and Roses and only need to to play the first 10 chords from sweet child of mine.

Or Oasis and just needed for Wonderwall."
357,Easy. Go to concert. Wait for guitar player to be killed. Step up.
358,"I think that's a dream of many fans. 

It could quickly become a nightmare if you fuck up, however..."
359,"Walk Hard.

360,"I believe in you Dewey, I just know you're going to fail!"
361,Yes.
362,This story is better if it was two different people.
363,Titlegore for sure.
364,"dang it, I was just about to make this joke, too. ""So who was the audience member?"""
365,"It’s not on Cash. Band gets x rate for touring and performing and since that takes a majority of their time, there isn’t likely to be another revenue stream. This is why bands fight hard for songwriting / publishing credits. 

I don’t know if Wootton had any songwriting credits but if he didn’t, the rate for a touring musician in the 60’s, 70’s, etc wouldn’t likely to be very high. Cash and crew weren’t playing Wembley every night and merchandising wasn’t where it is now."
366,"Also, the late Don LaFontaine - the voice of thousands of movie trailers."
367,Anyone got a bag of dice???
368,"After Luther died, cash hired a temporary replacement named Carl Perkins  (the two men are not related) he is the one that didn't show up."
369,Carl Perkins is a different musician and songwriter altogether.
370,Carl Perkins wrote and originally recorded Blue Suede Shoes that was later popularized when Elvis covered it.
371,"Probably made pretty decent money but not enough to live off of indefinitely, especially because I can't imagine he made much in royalties. That or he could have just come to enjoy life on the road."
372,Sometimes backup players only make a flat rate and don’t own any of the royalties. My friend was in a band that had a one-hit wonder top the Billboard charts. He got paid for recording sessions and $1500/week on the road plus per diem. That was the late 1990s. It’s more than enough to live on but when it stops you probably don’t have a lot of savings. He literally couldn’t get a job a McDonald’s after that because he had very little experience and a platinum record so they figured he wouldn’t be happy flipping burgers.
373,Recording band vs touring are often different so touring artists often don't make royalties
374,"Johnny Stopped touring in 97, and Bob was not part of the American recording sessions. Not sure when he drove the tour bus for the pumpkins but its not like he had a 401k (or heath insurance) or something."
375,With very little cash
376,health insurance for one I'd imagine. tour folk (crew and sidemen) get paid flat fees not salaries. unless you're lucky enough to work for a family type organization that will pay for your coverage when you're NOT on tour.
377,"> Did johnny cash not pay him enough?

Up until insta/youtube made it easier for musicians/artists to get fame/sponsorships recently, plenty of 'famous' touring musicians made fairly low money; like lower than your average college grad. Music wasn't big money unless you were huge. And even then, some got screwed by their contract. There's a famous interview from someone in the R&B group TLC in the early 90s where she said after paying taxes/management fees/etc, the groupmembers cleared ~$50k each in one of their biggest years, and they were huge..."
378,"Everyone else in the band did at one point or another.

Friends of mine were at a show of theirs in Hoboken right before Gish was released.  Want to say Maxwells, but anyways he hung out with them a bit afterwards, and helped them load up their van and James said something along the lines of ""Billy is an Asshole"" to him."
379,"(Cool guy, if he whips out that guitar and starts singing a song about his previous job experience, he's in!)"
380,He didn't miss a show. The show was cancelled! By himself.
381,"To be fair, he probably had to make last minute changes for the passports, as they mention in the email, and just couldn’t get them done before the show."
382,"There was some animosity between Perkins and Elvis. Carl wrote and recorded Blue Suede Shoes, and before it was released he was in a car wreck. He was in the hospital the day before it was to be released and saw Elvis perform it on TV. That's the story Perkins told, anyway."

If you haven't seen it before, check out ""The Wrecking Crew"".  It's a documentary about studio musicians playing tracks for albums put out by famous bands.  Some of these guys were making $5k a week - in 1970 - and had nothing to show for it at the end (well, except for great memories I  imagine).  Excellent documentary."
408,"I think you're overestimating how much a touring musician would make, especially if they weren't getting royalties."
409,"Not if you're on the road. It's expensive, like trying to maintain two households, at the minimum."
410,"Touring musicians often don't make much money.  There are stories a plenty.  Even, if you play for a massive act, your pay does not scale all that much.  The recording artist will keep the majority of the gig profits and do enough to keep the rest of the band in fresh underwear.

I believe it too, you can make a lot of money really fast in O&G but it also attracts a lot of... not so well educated or disciplined people who just burn it all up."
430,"I mean, 100k salary still requires money management... that’s like upper middle class money, not filthy rich money (especially in some of the higher cost of living areas).

465,Was he also the one with the large penis that he would show off? I think he also has those recordings of phone calls where he talks about “finger f@&$ing” and his “bunghole”
466,"He had other nicknames too, but we dont talk about that."
467,I love it cause the nickname sounds like he has a lot of good ideas ('lightbulb moments') but he really just turned lights off.
468,"Another fun fact:- The first president to install electric lighting at the White House was Benjamin Harrison in 1891, but he never touched the light switches himself, for fear of being electrocuted. This was a reasonable fear, given how crude household electric wiring could be at the time. It was the White House domestic staff that operated the light switches exclusively."
469,When he was governor of Texas he brought electricity to a lot of Texans. It was pretty crazy considering when he was governor. Wonder if that had anything to do with his conservation of energy at the White House
470,"I've heard he named his penis ""Jumbo"" and used to whip it out at parties. Also heard he had an aquatic car that he would regularly drive people into his lake with. Also, he grew his hair out in the 70s. What a interesting post-presidency for this man."

They are NOT responsible for state dinners and functions."

> “So my assistant and I worked on his shower, and the president tried it and said, ‘That was nothing.’ Then he said he wanted body sprays all around, not just overhead. He wanted one on the floor, too. This wasn’t for his feet -- he wanted it to hit up his rear,” Arrington said.

> “We ended up with four pumps, and then we had to increase the size of our water lines because other parts of the house were being sucked dry,” Arrington said in the Life interview.

515,"And to think, I thought everyone on Downton Abbey was pronouncing it incorrectly the whole time. Nowl you tell me that I'm the idiot."
516,"In modern French, 'valet' is pronounced without the t. 

'Both are French importations of valet (the ""t"" being silent in modern French) or varlet, Old French variants of vaslet ""man's servant"", originally ""squire, young man"", assumed to be from Gallo-Romance Vulgar Latin *vassellittus ""young nobleman, squire, page"", diminutive of Medieval Latin vassallus, from vassus ""servant"", possibly cognate to an Old Celtic root wasso- ""young man, squire"" (source of Welsh gwas ""youth, servant"", Breton goaz ""servant, vassal, man"", Irish foss ""servant""). See yeoman, possibly derived from yonge man, a related term. '

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valet"
517,"So the word is French and is pronounced as in French but it is wrong because reasons? Sadly, won't even be the most useless TIL I'll read today...."
518,Must be regional. In Canada - central anyway - it's pronounced valay. Forte is pronounced fortay.
519,They pouLET for chickens too.

522,"And the word forte, when meaning strong point, is pronounced fort. But since people mix it up with the musical term, pronounced fortay, it is consider an acceptable pronunciation today.

I often pronounced it fort and giggle when ""corrected""."
523,"In modern French, it is pronounced 'valay'. 

The article got it totally wrong."
524,"Forte is not ""fort"" and is not ""fortay"" either.

It's italian. For-teh. (Stress on the o)"
525,Touché
526,"No, ‘forte’, the noun, meaning strong point,  is the feminine form of French ‘fort’.  One syllable. 

The Italian word, ‘forte’, is most usually an adjective, meaning ‘strong, loud’ in reference to musical performance. It is absolutely pronounced ‘for-tay’."
527,Pronounced Too-shay?
528,"I'm Italian. We do use the word ""forte"" as strong point. It's a masculine noun for us.

""È il mio forte"" = ""It's my forte""

Maybe I'm wrong but I'm pretty convinced that it's an italian word, as I speak French and have never heard someone use ""forte"" as a noun"

558,"No, deal with reality."
559,Isnt this whole comment thread about how Beijing shouldnt have gotten HK and Macau back in the first place? They are indisputably worse off.
560,"That's not quite true. International law required the UK to give back the New Territories, not Hong Kong. I don't think the other commentator was espousing particularly conservative points: multiple ideas were considered. One being to simply keep Hong Kong, another to grant Independence. In the end it was decided that relations with China were more important and HK has, in my opinion, suffered the consequences."
561,International law is a meaningless concept.
562,"The reality is: 

China: one country, two systems."
563,"The UK  and the Portuguese governments made the right decision, as it was Chinese territory given back to China. 

Both territories, along with China, have flourished economically since both handovers."

The UK government made the right decision."
565,It only is for anti-Communist McCarthy like fanatics.
566,What is chinese territory? The PRK is an illegitimate regime with no territorial rights.
567,"The right decision for the UK government, maybe. Clearly it was in your opinion. But the UK has a delightful track record of turning it's back on ex-colonies and this is a prime example. Take, for example, how quickly they created the [British National Overseas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_(Overseas)) status for Hong Kong citizens to cut down on what was feared to be a flood of migration to the UK. The British government knew they were handing over 5 million people from a relatively free and prosperous city to an authoritarian government which explicitly stated they wanted to assimilate them - this was not the same China that the UK took the islands from 99 years previously. The 50 year rule was put in to slow that process and it's debatable as to how successful that's been. Elections there only allow Communist Party members to stand, education has switched to Mandarin from the local Cantonese, and police brutality has sparked the [umbrella movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_Movement)."

Perhaps it’s variable."
589,"I've had dreams that cover years. Not every night, but regularly. 

Average is likely near real time, tho."
590,Pretty crazy some people remember how long whatever they were doing in their dream took
591,Something that I find interesting for myself is that if I think of my life over the number of years that I have lived - it seems very short.  Like I've only lived for a short while - one's memories of one's life is very compressed and you forget the mundane day-to-day stuff - so only the main things are memorable.
592,"Very often I'll wake up 15-20min after going to sleep having lived through a whole adventure in my dream. So, to me, this rings false."

596,No..

598,"By ""cover years"" do you actually mean you went through living life for years in your dream?  You dreamed that you woke up, peed, walked to the kitchen ate breakfast, showered, went to work, surfed the internet, had small talk, etc, etc, 365 days x however many years you covered in your dream?"
599,"dude just had them describe the dreams and compared the description word count to the length of time they were recorded dreaming.

Except this is obviously a really imprecise way to calculate correlation, and the study assumed we only dream during REM. Except, we dream during NREM as well, meaning 'recorded dreaming times' would be meaningless without something measuring brain activity."

Yes, Canadian geese are aggressive and will fuck you up.

There’s a reason for that: every 13 years we Canadian participate in a magic ritual where we transpose all our negative emotions into the geese. This is the reason Canada is such a friendly place.

645,"Burying the lede: This walk was supposedly in the month of *October* through mountain passes of Norway.  I say ""supposedly"" since all coverage is from *before* he made the walk rather than after, and he took a car for his first leg, so I'm not going to count on his actually having made it the rest of the way on foot.

658,ok.
659,He would have gotten there much faster if he didn't stamp his foot every step like a twat

688,Why? Hiking is fun.
689,Every gig during a certain song he takes out a hammer and starts hitting his own knees with it.

691,He stamps like a twat at every opportunity
692,He must only kinda like that song.
693,That's two trips to school for some Scandinavians.

I'm also pretty sure they oversold the show because there is no way the venue was under capacity. I'm still sad I didn't get to see Sabaton though, and I look forward to them coming back around."
720,Ah

728,Edmonton any chance?
729,I saw them with Hammerfall. It was super crowded. The sound was perfect though.

My wife and girlfriend are both seasoned metal heads, and they were both buried in my chest flinching every time the bass hit. This was way beyond any safe or sane level of noise."
736,"I only wear my plugs for the openers (if I don't know them well). I know people say they make it sound better, but I just don't like it. (And yes they as ""musicians"" plugs) I avoid being too close to one speaker and I don't go to very many shows, so risk of tinnitus is less."
737,"Calgary, at The Palace, which was a really weird choice of venue in the first place."
738,"I was gonna say, that sounds like the sound at the Shaw every time I go."
739,LEAVING OR DEAD
740,COMRADES STAND SIDE BY SIDE TO STOP THE NAZI CHARGE
741,That does sound like a problem.
742,"I'm always on the rail (last I saw Sabaton I got to the venue 4 hours early for this reason) or in the pit, and as I cannot afford good plugs I just go with a basic 3m pair. I love music too much to risk going without tho."

754,I figured it was taken while flying on Epstein's Lolita Express.
755,Shame they changed it.

When asked what he wanted as payment, he requested 1 grain of rice for square A1 on the first day, 2 grains for A2 on the second day, 4 grains for A3 on the third day etc., all the way to H8. Needless to say, he wasn't paid in full.

Also, there are 18 possible openings in chess, and 18 possible second moves, so after just one move each, there are a possible 324 positions. Then it gets really complex."
793,But how many football fields would they fill up?
794,"""Chess is insignificant compared to the depth of Go (weiqi)""

In Chess, there are only 24 legal moves at the outset of the game, whereas in Go there are 361... About 52 of those are the most reasonable, whereas in Chess there are only about 8 reasonable first moves."

863,Truth.  Barely solidified cheeze whiz*
864,It’s as much “cheese” as 14k gold is “gold” and most people don’t have a problem with that type of labeling. American cheese is not pure cheese but rather a blended product made of other cheeses mixed with things like milk fat in order to make it smoother and creamier.

The Front of WWI was a bloody stew of human, horse and other animal body parts. In that putrid mess a virus (H1N1) was carried back home with returning soldiers. Spreading around the world infecting 500 million and killing 50 - 100 million of the very young and old. There was no cure. It just stopped. There is still no cure."

There's nothing that says he was the one who made the drink popular. Also, a lot of people in the comments are jumping to the conclusion that Sir Hans Sloane invented chocolate milk. That's not in the article either.

The origins of chocolate and who added what to it first are still widely disputed. This article specifically points out that Jamaicans may have even added milk and cinnamon long before Sir Hans Sloane. And we know humans have known chocolate as far back as  350 BC. 

The history of chocolate has a lot of question marks and is disputed by many historians. We know that it was brought back to Spain from the Americas in the 1500s. The French drank it with milk, sugar and vanilla. The English may have been the first to create solid chocolate bars. And the Swiss are often credited with combining the hard chocolate bar of the English, with the flavor of the French. But as you can even see in the comments of the article, all that is still hotly disputed. Nobody knows for sure."

Alcoholic beverages like beer, cider and wine of course provided a safe low alcohol source of hydration in places where clean, uncontaminated drinking water wasn't always convenient.

Teas, Herbal teas and coffee have both long been appreciated for their stimulative, calming, etc side effects.

Carbonated beverages like Coke were offered by the pharmacists shop, some with some ""active ingredients"" we no longer have in modern formulations. Dr. Pepper, of course had claims to aid in ""digestion and restores vim, vigor and vitality"".

Herbal Bitters, which are a classic foundation to many a traditional drink were patent medicines to cure what ailed you, and conveniently used alcohol as a base to carry active ingredients. Too many alcoholic beverages to speak of with medical back stories. Probably easier track down the few that don't.

1110,"As I was reading the title, I got my Billys mixed up and was imagining Billy Joel the entire time. I was surprised that a nice fellow like him would trash a hotel room."
1111,IN THE MIDNIGHT HOUR SHE CRYS MORE MORE MORE WITH A REBEL YELLLLLL 🎶
1112,"Funny, I just heard a story of him staying in a hotel and trashing it. After he refused to leave the army was sent in and tranquilized him. Also charged $250k for the damages."

1114,"Ah, rocker Billy Idol.    
For a minute I thought it was the other Billy Idol."

1116,"""Get back in your room Idol. And shave those sideburns."""
1117,"My sister once told me her friend was Billy Idol's daughter, and that he would run around the house naked. I think I believe her now.

She met this ""friend"" at a rehabilitation boarding school."
1118,"Back in the day, MTV was so starved for videos they gave this no-talent a career."
1119,"Slash's book gives an unbelievable account of when he went to Maui for rehab but kept some heroin in a container around his neck that customs never checked.  Before checking in to rehab, he did the heroin. He got so high he found himself running across a golf course completely nude in the middle of the day.  He was so ripped he thought little elves were attacking him which is why he bolted from his hotel shower in the first place .  He ran into the lobby and hid behind some lobby bushes, again, completely naked.  Obviously arrested.  Man, that is being seriously high.  Once he came down, he didn't remember anything until months later."
1120,"Nah. Many rockers were assholes but not all. It wasnt all glam rock / hair metal / commercialized punk

But those guys famous for being assholes of course ruined hotel rooms, lives and most noticeably their own bodies."
1121,"It’s one thing for Led Zeppelin, Clapton or The Who to smash things up - I feel like they have the chops. Mega bands, if you will, who’ve somehow earned the right. But that droopy little twat from Bromley, with a couple of hits under his belt hanging on the coattails of proper punk bands, who subsequently disappeared into obscurity, can fuck *right* off. Pay the repair bill, charge him and maybe give him a few weeks community service repairing the place before deporting the little prick."
1122,"""We're on a mission from Clapton."""
1123,You missed out the part where they get a lift from Ted Bundy and end up curb stomping him in a trackstop carpark
1124,"DeCaprio as Idol, and Pitt as Belushi (spends 2 years eating nachos and gains 150 pounds for the role), I'd pay to see that"
1125,That movie introduced me to the concept of edible underwear. Kid me asked my mother for edible underwear after watching that movie.
1126,"I saw it like 25 years ago, but I don't remember anything about it now."
1127,"I recall that it did pretty poorly at the box office because of its weirdness.  People were just expecting something different with Aykroyd and Belushi.  I loved it, however.  Aykroyd is an absolute nut in this film.  One of his better performances."
1128,The novel.its based  on (with the same title )by Thomas  Berger is pretty good too
1129,"Holy flipping shit! I thought I was the only crazy fan of ""Neighbors"". That overlooked flick is chock full of brilliant moments from Belushi and Ackroyd. 

""Blow it out your ass, wimp!"" gets me rolling every time."
1130,"YES.  Great movie, and weird as fuck.  Akroyd has blond hair, and Cathy Moriarty - fresh off Raging Bull - is in it also.  A similar movie - though not as good - is The 'Burbs, with Tom Hanks."
1131,I saw it in the theater when it came out.  Definite bizarro world stuff that.
1132,"In the early 1980s we stayed in a motel. They used to broadcast movies to all the rooms, but we missed the first few minutes of that night's film. Anyway I loved it, but for *years* never knew that the film's title was *Neighbors*. Can't remember how I eventually figured it out but it was years later."
1133,"From what I remember Neighbors (great film in my opinion) was Belushi's attempt to shed the wild man image he had from Animal House/Blues Brothers etc, and become a serious actor."
1134,"I’m pretty sure they switched their roles at the last minute, with Dan as the crazy one and Belushi as the straight man"
1135,"Ah yes,the two sexualities, the straight and the maniac"
1136,"I've seen it several times, then again I'm old, I can attest, great movie."

John's gone, found dead, 

He dies high, he's brown bread. 

Later said to have drowned in his bed.

After the laughter, the wave of the dread, 

It hits us like a ton of lead.

It seems ""learn not to burn"" 

Means to turn on a dime

And walk on if you're walking 

Even if it's an uphill climb.

And try to remember that working's no crime, 

Just don't let 'em take and waste your time.

That's why I'm here."
1139,Mony mony
1140,Cocaine is one hell of a drug
1141,"On the day of [John Belushi's death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Belushi#Death), he was visited separately by friends Robin Williams and Robert De Niro."
1142,They were probably partying with each other that night. Nothing creepy about this situation.
1143,"It's a pretty small world for celebrities, especially in L.A."
1144,Millions?  For one hotel room?  That's a hell of a sweet pad.
1145,Are you sure you're not getting confused with an episode of The A-team?
1146,I’ve always wanted to be a rich musician who could just destroy hotel rooms and shit without having to worry about it. Feel like it would be a great way to prove myself.
1147,he tamed himself recently

1152,Generation X wasn't a proper punk band?  Really?
1153,If he had disappeared into obscurity this wouldn’t be a TIL post.
1154,He would've been bitterly disappointed the cops weren't there for him. 'No attention for YOU sonny boy!'

1157,"“Each of you owes me one hundred wog scalps. And I want my scalps. And all y'all will git me one hundred wog scalps, taken from the heads of one hundred dead wogs.” he drunkenly commands the audience in Birmingham"
1158,This is quite a comment. Well done sir.
1159,It’s super bizarre but I love it. I remember reading that the guy that wrote the book that it’s based on hated it. But Aykroyd is so off the wall and Belushi being the straight man is just hilarious to me. There’s some really funny scenes in it.
1160,"Damn, thanks for that. Neighbors has been one my decades-long go tos for non-stop laughs but I never thought to look for a novel. On to my Amazon wishlist it goes."
1161,For me it’s the line “That was very foolish Earl! And it could get you snuffed!”
1162,Love the ‘Burbs. That scene where he’s eating the sardines on a cracker is hilarious.
1163,I think I remember reading that too. It totally elevated the film in my opinion.
1164,Across from the cinema cinaplex.
1165,"If I ever die I hope no one writes such bad lyrics in my memory.

Listening to this now and holy shit this is even hokier than I imagined. This cheesy upbeat chorus is so awful and unfitting."
1166,Come on.
1167,Just seems so...out of the blue lol
1168,Or lotsa damage
1169,I'm pretty sure...
1170,"There's a story about Led Zeppelin trashing a hotel room, throwing TVs out the windows of their rooms (High up) and causing general mayhem.

Later on their manager is dealing with the hotel manager (paying off the damage) and the hotel manager says something like 

""I wonder what it feels like to throw a TV out a window like that""

The manager peels off a few more bills from a stack of cash and says ""Why don't you find out?""

Massive paraphrasing going on, I read that tale years ago"
1171,"And my wife and boss and kids and parents will say ""We were wrong about you Dennis"""
1172,"Always found it a bit hypocritical that rockers are absolutely known for doing this, but rappers always get the bad rep for being troublemakers. 

Like can’t we all agree that money + youth = absolute chaos?"
1173,"Dude, he heard it from his uncle's cousin's ex wife's brother-in-law. It's legit."
1174,Might be that he only remembers the heroin...
1175,"Anything Opiod based can cause hallucinations, though it is a side effect and not everyone will have hallucinations."

1177,It's gotta be a quote from somewhere... right?
1178,*[Belushi projectile vomits over police officers]*
1179,I don't think I can get through another Akroyd movie after watching Dr Detroit.
1180,"If Neighbors had been a hit it is full of quotable craziness that would have made it into daily usage.

Another overlooked gem I never turn down the chance to see is ""The Dark Backward"" with Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, and more. It is the most insane, dystopian uncomfortable bleak comedy ever. Paxton takes his inner madness to a whole new level."
1181,"Just one of my favorite movie quotes.
No one has ever gotten it when I have said it."
1182,That would undeniably be lots of damage but you can only do millions worth of damage to something that is worth millions to begin with.
1183,"Best one I heard is Keith Moon is staying in a hotel and tosses the TV out the window.  Someone from the hotel staff comes out front, looks up and yells, ""Hey, you threw the TV out the window!""  He yells back, ""Yes I did, and tell the front desk if they don't pick up the phone the sofa's going out the window too!"""
1184,Fuck you Karen. \*snorts massive rail.
1185,"They WERE wrong about you Dennis. Unless they said kind things. 

God loves you?"
1186,"Nah, they were both regarded the similarly within their own timelines. The whole satanic panic thing in the '90s, even the beach boys were negatively regarded by people. Although being white I will say probably helped them in the long term, no doubt...

Fuck read up on the whole KISS debacle, now a days they're basically soft rock."
1187,Well I mean the rockstars dont go around shooting at each other.
1188,If you'd like the link to the video I can send it. I literally just watched it again and it actually said it was the military. But everything else checked out. If the story they are telling is true....
1189,I love it when someone cuts my heroin with MDMA.

1193,Yeah original quote was by /u/firthy
1194,"SoOff topic but 

I took a voice-over class in LA in the 90’s, and “Mom” from that movie, Kate something (I’m lazy) was in it w me and she trying to catch the next paying thing.  She did a few Tide commercials and then not so much."
1195,Doctor woo woo Doctor Detroit...
1196,"I just looked this up because I’ve never heard of it. The cover is pretty bad though not untypical of the early 80s. Looks pretty bad though. I mean he did do Ghostbusters after that so that’s something, but he’s had plenty of bad movies."
1197,I love Dr. Detroit!
1198,How that movie didn't win an academy award is beyond me
1199,How that movie didn't win an academy award is beyond me
1200,That movie stinks.
1201,"Not quite true. A room could be worth $100k in assets and furnishings, but to replace those assets and furnishings would cost $100k + labor and other expenses needed to refurnish and replace the room. Labor isn't cheap, neither are the resources needed to dispose of the trash and broken furnishings. Include paint and/or wallpaper to replace the damages to the wall, any maintenance required to repair damaged vents, smoke detectors, etc. and the costs start to pile up way, way more than just the $100k value of the room itself."
1202,I'll try to look it up
1203,"K googled it. Ur right . Saw a video I was drinking so shit happens. 250,000 only"
1204,Mite have got confused. In same video the other band had a whole floor....not sure which one...
1205,"Haha, fantastic"
1206,"I forget where I heard it, but apparently Joe Walsh taught Keith Moon how to destroy hotel rooms and they teamed up once."
1207,Massive
1208,"Yes it does. When you take enough, especially if it's enough to nod out, it definitely causes hallucinations. That's where the term ""pipe dream"" comes from: the visions one gets from smoking opium."
1209,Yea sounds more like morning glory seeds
1210,I had to look it up - I never knew that. Apparently he didn’t like alcohol and never did drugs. He did say he would “toast to be social” but hated the taste.
1211,"Another off topic fact:

She's the women on the artwork for Supertramp's Breakfast in America album

P.s. Happy cake day"
1212,I’ve always wondered if that Mom was the inspiration for Futurama’s Mom. There’s some similarities between the characters.
1213,Not to mention the fact that they can't generate any revenue from the room while it's being repaired.
1214,In same video someone did worse. They had a whole floor...
1215,"Even if the assets were 500k, in order to get to $1mill total ($500k labor), that's 2500 man-hours at a robust $200 an hour.  Hard to imagine $500k in labor.  You could build a 2000sf home from scratch in less man-hours"
1216,It's ok were not the insurance company lol we don't care.
1217,Til the meaning of pipe dream.
1218,"Ya I remember, him and Ted Nugent, it was about the ladies and not the drinking / drugs"
1219,"And as a follow-up to that, recently passed away."
1220,"Also that you can't sell any of the other high-roller suites next to that room while the loud repair work is being carried out.

e.g. if a room worth $100,000 in fixtures and fittings is rented out for a nightly rate of $5,000 (low estimate for such a room) and the whole room needs replacing, then it costs the $100k + (X times nightly rate divided by occupancy) + labor for X days + X times nightly rate over occupancy for any rooms within earshot. Crazy quite fast."
1221,Way to Superdampen the mood. Jk. R.I.P.
1222,"I thought ""Brokeback Mountain"" came from a short novel by Annie Proulx?"
1223,"Also, Lonesome Dove."

1225,"He also won the Pulitzer for his extraordinary novel, ""Lonesome Dove."""
1226,He’s a great writer. His writing partner asked him to write the screenplay to Brokeback with her after she found the Annie Proulx story. They co-wrote it and she also produced the film. I think he still travels back and forth between Arizona and Texas.
1227,Alright
1228,Right. The screenplay was by McMurtry. Sorry. 😐
1229,"Phenomenal book, and probably the best movie that I've ever seen. Also, his son is arguably the greatest living song writer we have today"

1232,"Cool, thanks for confirming my memory's not totally shot. :-)"

The gist of superforecasting is not about groups making predictions or anything having to do with the power of the crowd.  Instead its about the methodical application of incremental change of diminishing magnitude as you approach the date of evaluation.

Very cool read."

1264,Interesting
1265,Yes! Revisions and ability to respond to new data & not be anchored. I work in financial research and this is typically a key fault of analysts.
1266,"> Tetlock says superforecasters share some qualities, like being actively open-minded, seeking new data, updating one’s opinion when new data requires it, and seeking out reliable expert advice to inform one’s own opinions.

so i am a superforecaster. nice. the term i use is ""extraploration"". see the actual state if something; get to know, what the past was; imagine, how the change happened; extrapolate the likely future outcome. until two years ago, i could not understand, that others can't do it like me.

i. e. when Trump announced to run for President, i knew, that he would win, no matter who would run against him. it was about media appearances all the time. now, it is about hope. Buttigieg is the only one to win over Trump; if Warren or Biden become his opponent, they will lose. Bernie is a nice old man without any chance.

yet, reddit is a filterbubble, strange enough to think, that Trump supporters are a minority, so there is no useful discussion possible in /r/politics, so they will continue to rant, and to tell people to ""register to vote"", and believe, that their engagement within reddit does matter.

with more superforecasters, life would be easier.

What was the extent of US complicity in this particular matter:

* the CIA supplied communications equipment to help him spread his false reports
* the U.S. embassy had reliable information that placed blame on rank-and-file PKI members
* a U.S. embassy staff member admitted he handed over a list of communists to the Indonesian military as the terror was underway.

The CIA is the President's tool.  They aren't out there amusing themselves; they are carrying out the instructions of their chain of command.

2.- He hates freedom, literally, I know the ""they hate us for our freedoms"" sounds like such a meme, but they really did, Bin Laden literally wrote in his letter that one of the reasons for 9/11 was that western women are ""whores who show too much skin"", ""you drink alcohol"" and ""Las Vegas is too sinful n sheit"".

3.- He was angry at US presence in the middle east that wasn't even hostile, he hated US bases in SA that are there with permission of SA and Kuwait, basically he probably hated the ""presence of kaffir too close to Mecca"".

4.- He was angry at US sanctions against Iraq, sanctions that were in place because Saddam Hussein was an arab Hitler, this is the man who commited genocide with chemical weapons, razed entire villages to the ground and murdered everybody who opposed him, but yeah, I guess sanctions are a worse evil!

Those are the fucking literal reasons you can read in his letter, it's beyond pathetic ""their reasoning was just like yours"" yeah, sure, if you are such a moral relativist then stop acting like I'm in the wrong since you don't believe anybody can be wrong and all pespectives are relative."

> It has been described as the Titanic’s last mystery and involves one of the most tragic of all tales connected to the sinking.

> Loraine Allison, then aged two, had been travelling on the liner with her family when it sank.

> Initial reports said that she had died, along with her parents, but no body was ever found.

> In the years that followed, though, a sensational twist saw a woman, Helen Kramer, come forward claiming to be the child, and apparently able to provide details thought to be known only to the family.

> She mounted a long campaign to be accepted by surviving members of the wealthy Allison family, in the face of their strong opposition.

> That claim has been sustained, after her death, by Kramer’s own descendants, in an increasingly bitter dispute, which has seen restraining orders taken out, accusations of harassment made, and even security patrols set up to stop a family burial plot being interfered with.

> Now, however, more than a century after the sinking, the mystery has been solved, following the culmination of the Loraine Allison Identification Project, which was established by a group of Titanicologists, as aficionados of the doomed liner are known.

> The group arranged for DNA testing of both the descendants of Kramer and from the family who had died on the ship, which revealed no genetic link, exposing the decades-old claim as a hoax.

> The ruling meant Loraine kept the unhappy claim of being the only child from first of second class to die in the sinking.

> She had been travelling with her parents, Hudson and Bess, and seven-month old brother Trevor.

> Her father was a Canadian entrepreneur and the family travelled with an extensive entourage of servants. When the ship struck the iceberg, Trevor was taken onto a lifeboat by a maid, Alice Cleaver.

> Hudson, Bess and Loraine remained on board, apparently giving up many opportunities to be saved, possibly because they were searching for their son.

> Some reports state Bess and Loraine were placed in a lifeboat, but that they returned to the ship, either because Bess would not leave her husband, or because she was distraught, not knowing that her son was safe.

> The three were supposedly last seen huddled together on the boat deck, near the officers’ quarters, as others were struggling nearby to free the last of the collapsible lifeboats for use. Only Hudson’s body was recovered. The family featured in Julian Fellowes 2012 drama, Titanic, as well as an earlier US television series, made in 1996.

> It was not until 1940 that Helen Kramer, styling herself Loraine Kramer made her claim to be the missing child. She appeared on a radio show called “We, the people”, and said she had been saved at the last moment when Hudson placed her in a lifeboat with a man who brought her up as his own.

> Helen Kramer

> This “Mr. Hyde” had raised her as his own in England, where she said she attended boarding school, before moving to the US. She said Mr Hyde had revealed the truth to her after she requested her birth certificate and shortly before his death.

> Kramer said he had also disclosed his real identity: Thomas Andrews, who had been Titanic’s designer and builder and who was thought to have died in the sinking.

> Despite the apparently far fetched claims, some distant relations of the couple apparently believed her. However, immediate family members did not accept her and when she died in 1992, it seemed as it the mystery rested there.

> However, it was revived on the centenary of the sinking in 2012 when Kramer’s granddaughter, Debrina Woods, from Florida, restated the claim on a series of forums dedicated to the Titanic.

> She set up a website, selling posters, mugs and mouse mats highlighting her claim and said she planned to write a book about the story.

> She claimed she had found a suitcase belonging to her grandmother which was full of documents substantiating the family case. She also tried to contact the Allison family and arrange a visit, prompting the intervention of their lawyers to ask her to cease. A restraining order was even taken out to stop Ms Woods scattering her grandmother’s ashes over the Allison family plot, in Chesterville, Ontario, with extra security measures put in place, when she paid a visit to the area.

> If her claim was established, she would be eligible to inherit much of the family wealth, and the issue has divided Titanic experts. While many were sceptical, others were supportive of her case. The debate led to the founding of the identification project, by Tracy Oost, a forensic scientist at Laurentian University, in Canada and Titanic researcher.

> She asked both sides to take part in the DNA screening, to test their Mitochondrial DNA, which passes through the maternal line.

> Sally Kirkelie, the great niece of Loraine’s mother, agreed to take part, and although Mrs Woods declined, her half sister, Deanne Jennings, who shared the same mother and same link to Helen Kramer, agreed.

> David Allison, grandson of Hudson’s brother Percy Allison, said: “The Allisons never accepted Mrs Kramer’s claim, but the stress it caused was real. It forced my ancestors to relive painful memories described to me as immeasurable sorrow and unending grief.

> “I would like to thank Deanne Jennings and Sally Kirkelie for offering their DNA to stop this harassment. This was a courageous, selfless act, and I will remain forever indebted for their act of kindness.”

> Nancy Bergman, a sister of David’s, said: “These DNA results have uncovered a colossal fraud that has haunted my family for years. It was all about the money …. Debrina wants to write a book and no doubt there are others out there who want to profit from our story. It is our story. Leave us in peace.”

> Prof Oost said: “It is good to have a resolution here, but we mustn’t forget that this is all about one of the more tragic of tales to come from the Titanic. The only mystery that remains now is who was Helen Kramer.”

> Further investigation suggests she was raised in Michigan, as Evangline Irene Lee Hyde. However Ms Woods, 61, a retired chef, is standing by her claims. She declined to comment on the DNA results, but said she had her own DNA evidence and the support of other members of the Allison family. The results, she said, will be revealed in a book she is currently writing. She also insisted she never intended to scatter her grandmother’s ashes at the Allison family plot. “We want to present the whole evidence. Not just come out with public findings,” she added.

> She denied harassing the family and insisted she had no interest in their money.

> “It is rubbish to suggest it is about money or claim I have harassed anyone. This was never about money. My grandmother never wanted money and I don’t either.”

> The project echoes the exposure of a similar bogus claim, made by Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Anastasia, the youngest daughter of the Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, who was killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918. After her death, DNA research proved there was no genetic link between the woman and the family."
1480,53 of the 76 children in steerage died. That's criminal.
1481,Shipwreck**
1482,Think it’s an expression
1483,If they didn’t have a nanny all their kids would be with them. Hence why I said rich people problems. It was a joke. It’s the internet.
1484,Thanks for that. What a tragedy all around
1485,"Fascinating read, although I am very frustrated for Allison's surviving family. I hope they find some peace even with the bogus claim."
1486,"And for all the ""women and children first"" stuff, a full third of the men in first class survived. 

At the time it really was assumed that the upper class had superior morals. The public were appalled."
1487,What’s steerage?
1488,"Never heard the expression before, everything else seems literal.

On further research, they might of meant the Californian, but I'm not sure the passengers saw it."
1489,Fair enough lol
1490,A third isn’t very many
1491,"> At the time it really was assumed that the upper class had superior morals. 

Good thing we don't live in those times any longer"
1492,The part of the ship where the passengers with the cheapest tickets were.
1493,The term originates from when the lowest-paying passengers would be placed in the same area where the steering gear for the ship was.
1494,"No, but compared to the survival rates of the other classes it was. It’s a relative situation."
1495,"Again,compare that to the death rate of the children in 3rd class. Or the women, where survival was split down the middle. 

People were shocked that these high class men would act in self interest, they really were considered of better moral stock."
1496,"""Although politically Hawaii is considered part of North America, geographically Hawaii is not part of any continent."" 

Have to admit that I had no idea about that, not that I needed to know about it but it's an interesting fact!"
1497,They are not moving on a continental plate me.  They are moving with an oceanic plate.
1498,I mean...... they're islands.....
1499,Hawaii islands are formed over a mantle hot spot.
1500,While not a continent it is part of Polynesia which is part of Oceania (all of the different island chains in the pacific from Hawaii down to papa New Guinea)
1501,I mean....isn't any island not part of a continent?
1502,Did you look at your first globe today?
1503,"Seriously?  They are volcanic islands, how did you not know that?"
1504,"Just learned this, huh?"
1505,No shit
1506,It’s the kind of fact that pretty obvious when you really think about it
1507,The Caribbean islands are considered part of North America. Great Britain and Ireland are considered part of Europe.
1508,[deleted]
1509,Continental shelf would be more to the point.
1510,"Well, for example the Canary Islands are part of Africa, New Zealand of Oceania, Greenland is actually in America, and so on."
1511,Came here thinking the same thing
1512,I mean... I can think of a big one where everything's upside down.
1513,They mean not on a Continental plate
1514,Yeah but now that it's out there it's gonna come up on /r/AskReddit til the end of time
1515,That's true
1516,"""So is Australia"" ohhhhhh nooooooo"
1517,Australia isn't an island.
1518,Oohh they meant continental *plate*
1519,NZ is part of Tasmantis
1520,That's only to stop the drop bears from getting us
1521,"Haha, most likely yeah

Edit:

People of Reddit who thought Hawaii was part of a continent, where are you now?"
1522,"Dunno why you are getting down voted for speaking facts 🤔. But considering most people commenting on here didn't know Hawaii was an island, I can kinda see why.

Edit: also to those who will post that it is, it's considered an island continent because it's the only one that isnt attached to any other landmass. Still a continent though."
1523,"For everyone commenting on the dog had to stay because of his broken leg:

Dogs are really good at walking on 3 legs, and will drag themselves on 2 if they have to. In situations like this, the dog is usually so terrified that they just run after being hit, so it’s pretty remarkable that he did stay and do the job he was trained to do."
1524,"Awesome!  In 2014,  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) Los Angeles awarded their most heroic dog of 2014, to a cat.

Tara, a 6-year-old cat living with her human family in Bakersfield, California, raced into action when her 4-year-old human companion, Jeremy, was attacked without warning or provocation by a neighbor’s roaming dog. The entire incident was caught on security cameras and the video posted on YouTube by Jeremy’s father, Roger Triantafilo.

The boy had been playing quietly on his tricycle in his family’s driveway when the dog spied him and ran into the yard, grabbed his bare leg, and dragged him from his trike. With his teeth clamped into Jeremy’s leg, the dog was dragging the boy across the driveway and shaking his head violently when Tara sprinted toward them, slamming her body into the dog. The startled dog released Jeremy and ran, with Tara close behind him."
1525,"Kind of amazing how many people think a four-legged animal is completely immobilized by breaking *one* of their four legs. I mean, humans only have two legs and even we can move with one of them broken."
1526,"I am honestly surprised that PETA or another animal rights group of some kind or another hasn’t protested the use of animals as a service animal to humans. 

I mean, I’ve even heard they consider the term “pet” as meaning you own the animal instead of being equals and should call them instead “animal companions” 

But semantics aside, I’m kinda shocked they haven’t consider service animals as some kind of slavery and unfair to these animals that should be given the same rights as people."
1527,I love how happy he looks in that photo. Makes you hope that dogs have the same kind of emotional awareness we have.
1528,What does the weratedogs twitter account think of this?  [https://twitter.com/dog\_rates?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
1529,So this guide dog walked his owner into an oncoming bus? And he got a fucking reward for it?
1530,Goodest boy. Dogs with jobs who go above and beyond.
1531,"I mean, where else would you expect a dog with a broken leg to go?"
1532,i hope the dog is fully recovered.
1533,Apart for four months while they healed? That breaks my heart for both of them.
1534,Wholesome 100 keanu chungas minecraft moment 100 we don't deserve dogs
1535,I'd jump in front of a bus for that dog in a second.
1536,Well it's hard to leave with a broken leg.
1537,Good Dog.
1538,Bestest boy.
1539,we are not worthy.
1540,Amazing! My dog would have stolen her purse.
1541,Giving an award is a good way to avoid pay. That dog deserves payment. To live out a chill life for their owner. Otherwise we’d be treating them as disposable emergency devices.
1542,"This is a true good boi!! 

Years ago, someone broke into my second floor office while I was down the hall filling my coffee pot. My good girl grabbed him by the leg and held on ALL THE WAY DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE as he tried to kick her off. She only weighed 21 lbs, but 20 of it was courage and heart. 

The police told me the same man had broken into several other offices near me, and had assaulted two women. 

Good girl, Tara. Loyal dogs are always there for us."
1543,When I die I want to be reincarnated as a good boi.
1544,">“I was glad to see him, you know,” Stone said.

Odd choice of words for a blind woman."
1545,Definitely won’t see a cat do that
1546,We don't deserve dogs.
1547,"I'm not crying, you're crying."
1548,GOOD GOOD DOG!

1550,THEY’RE GOOD DOGS BRONT

1552,So a guide dog led his guidee in front of a bus and is somehow a hero?
1553,The goodest of boyes.
1554,We don't deserve this HERO.
1555,"What an awesome dog! Bless you, pup!"
1556,Such a good boy
1557,He's the goodest dog
1558,Lets see a cat do that.
1559,no I'm not crying you are
1560,We don't deserve dogs.
1561,What do we do to deserve dogs ?

1565,Q A P
1566,omg doggo:(
1567,Shit! Those things can be programmable so good!
1568,The goodest of boys.
1569,bona fide hero!
1570,"Could have been ""the best boi of the year"""
1571,I'm gonna say it again for the people in the back: this is a good boy
1572,I'm sure the dog will care about the award
1573,Aww good puppers!
1574,"Yeah , I'm definitely totally blind. For sure."""
1575,**Rams into oncoming traffic while speaking in tongues**
1576,Dogs are the best.

1581,Of course it's a golden.
1582,r/AnimalsBeingBros
1583,"And the hero came along! Blessed be you, precious cutie, sharing even on Mewe!"
1584,How does a guide dog know to run in front of a bus to block its owner. How do they train the dogs? Pretty sure the dog doesn’t know that it’s owner is blind right?
1585,We don’t deserve dogs...DOG=GOD❤️
1586,"Spouse of the Year, 2020!"
1587,Best boy ever.
1588,"But his name isn't even worth mentioning in the headline?

Edit: it's Figo."
1589,Wouldn't the guide dog have been the one who lead her in front of the bus in the first place?
1590,Good boy
1591,Til a dog could get hit by a bus and only have a broken leg
1592,Dogs are simply the best thing about this planet and the most substantial accomplishment of the human race as a whole.
1593,Awwww. . . #1001 reason why I love dogs. :')
1594,That’s the bestest of boys.
1595,Whenever I say who’s a good dog the answer will always be him/her
1596,I wish we didn’t put dogs in these situations.
1597,"We had 2 cats, my sister petted the aggressive cat and he did not like her and scratched her. When my other cat heard and saw what he did, she raced and chased him throughout the entire house, she came back just to check up on my sister and back to chasing him. Most loveliest cat I've ever had. Unfortunately my mother became severally allergic to cats and we had to give them away..."

1599,My dog pissed on my foot this weekend. Nice
1600,Anyone going to ask why this suspicious woof led his blind old lady out in front of a bus?
1601,This has answered the she old question. We now finally know who the good boy is.
1602,"Goldens are love, goldens are life."
1603,Such a great sweet boy
1604,"However well deserved the award was, I'm not sure why having a broken leg was suppose to make the dog staying put more impressive."
1605,Is there a Goodest Boys Hall of Fame?
1606,That enough to make a grown man cry
1607,"We don't deserve dogs man, why do dogs protect us so much we hear so many cases of dogs seemingly protecting their owners, is that a thing we breed then for?"
1608,"“I told him he’s home, so he knows he’s home”

Don’t make me cry 😭😭"
1609,Good Boy.
1610,The goodest boy

1612,If course a golden.
1613,The goodest of boys.
1614,"*looks at my own dog* ""So when are you gonna step up and be Dog of the Year?"""
1615,Seems like a dog that doesn't lead it's owner in front of buses should be getting this prize.
1616,We don't deserve dogs.
1617,"Didn’t leave her side until she received medical attention \*because\* he suffered a broken leg. 

Still a good boy though"
1618,[deleted]
1619,And people in Wuhan be throwing their dogs out 12 story windows.
1620,"see.. . this is something I want to post on facebook, but... I don't have it anymore.  wholesome... and totally out of character for a dog from NY."
1621,I don’t understand
1622,"Yeah it's not gonna leave with a fucking broken leg, is it?"
1623,"I'm so sick of these fucking ""so this happened and this big deal"". If you dont want to read the goddamn photo and text someone found interesting and relevant, then don't waste our time with your asinine comment. Why even bother typing if you care so little?you fucking bunch of pissants."
1624,That dog’s name? Ellen Pao.
1625,"Not to be a dick, but I thought a guide dog is supposed to lead its owner away from danger, not sacrifice itself. Sounds like that dog didn't do its job properly! 

Jokes aside, good dog!"
1626,Anyone who says he didn't move because he had a hurt leg clearly have no idea how survival instincts work especially in animals if the dog wanted to move he could have mostly likely had the adrenalin rush need to run away but no the dog over came the natural instinct to run because of its training and loyalty to it's handler. Dogs have been with us for thousands of years we evolved around them and they did the same.
1627,"Everyone's talking about the dog, but nobody questioning why the blind person says things like, “And then he broke away from my hand and flung himself at the bus, like Superman, he just flew, he jumped up at the bus to stop it.” and “I was glad to **see** him, you know.” How did the blind person see all that..."
1628,Yeah my dog was ran over by a car and ran away after it was over. She hid underneath our houses crawl space for hours until she came to me for a hug.
1629,Reminds me of the gif of the dog creature that seems to be struggling dragging their fourth leg only to subverted by it standing up fine

1631,Can confirm I have a 3 legged lovable little beasty at home whose managed to do things I've never seen my 4 legged senior do.
1632,I think everyone commenting knows. It’s just too tempting to make this comment as a joke.
1633,My vet once said a dog is a three legged animal with a spare.
1634,You think the dog will go to the vet or something? It’s best instinct is to stay with familiar indivduals. Nothing spectacular here
1635,https://youtu.be/EEa6jZv-Khc that cat was like fuck no
1636,I wonder what caused that dog to attack that kid? It seemed so utterly random. Nice tackle from the cat
1637,"This makes me kinda sad. There's already a huge disparity in adoptions and search around cats vs dogs. Why not just create a heroic cat award that is more rarely awarded than glorifying ""good"" cats by saying their ""good"" behavior is dog-like. 

I'm primarily a dog lover, but cats have a serious PR problem when it comes to bonding perception and adoption. Seems like stuff like this should be an opportunity to highlight how great cats can be, not just compare them to dogs."
1638,I remember this!
1639,I’ve seen it and loved it so many times but it makes it so much better to know she got a heroic *dog* award.
1640,What impresses me about this comment is that you did not call the them stupid for suggesting otherwise.
1641,"I frequently move without using either legs

Though thats because im a lazy shit looking for the remote"
1642,"It’s crazy, my cat broke her pelvis, some toes, messed up her lungs, and managed to run some good 20m to hide"
1643,"While Peta itself hasn't, I've known and heard of many peta members being vocal about this exact point. I have a trained service dog and I'm constantly worried about it because Peta is super big where I live.

Edit: I know someone who claims their SD was stolen by one of these so-called ""rogue"" members."
1644,"They do. 

Source: have a service dog, have gotten flack from people for this exact reason. People seem to think training SDs involves abuse which, ignoring how fucked up that would be, quite frankly would produce the worst service dog of all time."
1645,"PETA doesn’t like the idea of domestic animals of any kind.  Live stock, zoos, beehives, aquariums, your house pets, doesn’t matter."
1646,"PETA is garbage, with how much dogs have evolved with us they would likely go extict without us. Even if all of them don't go extinct their lives would be much harder considering how much they've grown to depend on us, the life of a dog has improved drastically by being man's best friend."
1647,We should use PETA members as service animals.
1648,Is PETA that far off from the ASPCA?
1649,I've run in vegetarian and vegan circles and they uniformly think PETA are morons who do more harm than good. The few people in PETA I've actually met are mentally ill.
1650,I have a dream!..
1651,"Police dogs only ever think they're playing. I think its messed up that we train dogs to attack others, like its all a fun game. That dog would be just as happy playing fetch all day with a decent family. Instead, they put the dogs in the line of danger. If you defend yourself against this dog, its assault on a police officer. If I kick your dog for biting me, I won't be having any assault charges. It's seriously fucked up. They send in a dog, and the dog can receive the assault instead of the cowardly K9 officer. 

It's mans best friend, not mans best weapon."
1652,Wtf? The dog in that picture does not look happy. It looks hurt/sad
1653,"From what I can gather from other news articles about this same incident, the woman was already in the middle of the road when a mini bus came towards her. That's when the guide dog ran \*towards\* the bus, putting himself between the vehicle and his owner. Not that he ran ""onto"" the road."
1654,"I just read the article, and though it doesn't explicitly state where they were, it does say that they were ""**cross**ing the street"".  That's when it clicked in my head, and I realized they were probably on a **cross**walk, and the bus probably wasn't stopping/yielding appropriately."
1655,That's what I'm trying to figure out... Why were they walking in front of a bus?
1656,The bus ran a cross walk i guess? idk. Driver was charged with not yielding.
1657,"To be fair, he also got two broken legs. It’s also possible his person stepped off the curb before she should have I guess?"
1658,this needs to be the top comment
1659,"You'd be surprised at some animals resilience. My dog severed her Achilles tendon on a piece of corrugated steel near a barn and walked a 1/4 mile to the house to find me.

Granted, an injured dog would most likely want to remain near its human!"
1660,"Considering they still have 3 very functioning legs, they could go wherever they want."
1661,Away from immediate danger using 3 legs?
1662,"You sweet summer child.

Watched too many bad videos on r/wtf and other subs to know they can run on three or drag on two. Dog stayed for their owner in this case."
1663,"I wish I didn't know how wrong you are, because it's the kind of imagery that really sticks with you."
1664,"Hail a cab to the vet, duh. Probably just cant catch a cab as a dog in NYC even in 2015. Damn shame."
1665,no you wouldn't.
1666,Dogs can easily walk with 3 legs.
1667,"maybe for you, for a dog it isn't"
1668,You'd be surprised. Dogs muscle through a lot
1669,"Dogs are good at walking with 3 legs, and can even drag itself with 2 if frightened, which I’m sure it was, but it stayed anyways"
1670,Geez man try to have some positivity
1671,Not for a dog. Dogs can sprint on three legs
1672,"Right? In other news, the dog knows all its owner’s secrets, but has never told anyone."
1673,"Assuming there were no squirrels, cats, or tennis balls on the radar screen you might be right.

They usually take off, with all their legs or without."
1674,I came to say the same thing :-)
1675,"Our world would not be as it is today without elephants,herbivores, and dogs. They carved out a lot of what made the human population large, successful, and sustainable over time."

lol"
1688,I mean what is there to understand? Did you read the story?
1689,Technically we evolved them.
1690,"I've seen a dog with a broken leg run at a full sprint on 3 legs just to chase a squirrel. As soon as it got away up a tree she just laid down like, ""Oh I shouldn't have done that""."
1691,Technically IAmBecomingADog
1692,"How many stories are there of people getting hit by cars while saving a random dog? Lots, we weren’t technically trained for this but our loyalty for Canine’s is there."
1693,"Shit, if I got hit by a bus I'd probably try getting the hell out of there too, broken leg or not. Fight or flight is a hell of an instinct"
1694,"What was the dog gonna do, drive to the hospital?"
1695,im sorry what
1696,"Hmm, give me a few days, I want to test this theory, *and I have just the axe for this!*"
1697,Probably just a colloquialism in this case. We tend to use speech that refers to the wrong type of sense in many instances. Like when someone says “happy to hear from you” in response to a text or email.
1698,many blind people aren’t *fully* blind per se and they may have been able to make out the shapes of the dog/bus etc
1699,Sometimes being legally blind means you can still see shadows and close movement. But I don't know in this case.
1700,"The blind people in our residence commonly use phrases such as ""I see"" and ""I am reading this (audio)book""."
1701,"Perhaps they were visually impaired enough where they weren’t 100% without any vision, but still needs the assistance of a service dog"
1702,Not sure if you are joking or not but some people who are legally blind can still see somewhat.
1703,People can be legally utterly blind and still see a smidge of stuff
1704,There are different versions of blind people. Super blind vs kinda can't see that well. 😑vs🤓
1705,"A person in my country can be counted as blind even if its possible to see general shapes, 0.1 in sight is the legal requirement, I dunno if every country uses the same scale but as far as i know we just say 0.1 in sight."
1706,"Legal blindness is just vision that is at best 20/200 with corrective measures or an acuity field of less than 20 degrees (most people have a field of 140)

For reference, if your prescription is around -2, that's about 20/200 *uncorrected*."
1707,"Many people who are classified as blind still have some degree of vision left. For example, people with early-stage glaucoma can generally see straight ahead, but they progressively lose peripheral vision until they are completely blind."
1708,"Wait. Wasn't the dog supposed to stop the owner from walking in front of busses?

#YouHadOneJob"
1709,"Reminder that IRL blindness isn't just blackness. You can be blind and see some light or or movement, depending. People are kind of binary about disability, as when they think people who can walk but use a wheelchair sometimes are faking it."
1710,Not everyone who's legally blind is totally without sight
1711,He was just scratching his dick and balls
1712,He's just scratching his cawk and bawls
1713,"Lol wut? No dogs will generally run and hide or try and get away from the giant thing that just hit them. It's quite unusual for him to just stay there, but considering he's a trained service animal it's probably not as unusual as the article makes it sound?"
1714,There's a Wikipedia page about her too. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_(cat)
1715,"My friend had a cat that did something similar. A calico named Wendy. Wendy was the type of cat who only let you pet her when she wanted. Any attempt before that got you mauled. Then when she did let you it was still a crap shoot because if you didn't stop exactly when she wanted, and you got no warning, you got mauled. So we just figured Wendy was a bitch and liked no one.

So same kind of scenario me and my friend were teens at the time, outside working on something. A dog comes running out of the woods growling and barking lunging at us. Cue Wendy flying in out of nowhere, attacks the dog and runs it off. She then came back to both of us, I guess to make sure we were ok, let us give her a couple scritches, then bit the shit out of us and ran back off to do whatever it was she does.

My friend was like bro, Wendy does love us! I'm not so sure I think we're her bitches and nobody else is allowed to bite us but her."
1716,"I haven’t laughed harder in a long time than I just did watching the entire video with sound on. My god, how tone deaf can you be while editing."
1717,"Damn, that cat acted FAST. I've only ever seen those ""must protect my owner"" instincts in dogs before!"
1718,Why did the lady not pick up the kid and run in the house? Why check on the kid and then run in? Even if you are calling for an ambulance take the kid away from the dog.
1719,"Fuck that dog. Honestly if that was my kid, I would’ve killed it"
1720,So was that lady
1721,"So, not a tricycle."
1722,"I like at the end the cat's like ""wait no what am I DOING"" and turns around.

Been there bro.  Been there."
1723,Cats are alpha as fuck. Anyone who has owned both in the same house will tell you the cats are always in charge.
1724,"If I was the mom, once I got my kid safely secured, I’d grab a shovel and end that dog’s life"
1725,"There are a lot of things that can go into a random animal attack.  Perhaps the dog viewed more than just it's own yard as it's territory and thus felt like it was protecting its owner by attacking something approaching.  Or it could have been poorly treated and had become aggressive.

Sometimes dogs will develop a dislike for children because of the way the children are closer to their eye level. They view them as a threat.  It's really strange.  When my German Shepherd was a puppy he hated children.  Now that he's grown he loves them.  I was really worried when he was a pup though that he'd not grow out of it."
1726,"According to the wiki page for the cat, the dog was spontaneously violent and quarantined to test for rabies. During the quarantine, they determined the dog was too hostile to adopt out, and euthanized it much to the despair of animal rights groups."
1727,"That shoulder-check was the cat saying ""Hey! That's my bread and butter you're fucking with."""
1728,"My dog hates anything on wheels like bicycles and stuff, probably got startled or intimidated."
1729,The ducking and sneaking around the car is very worrisome.
1730,"dogs are still just animals

perfectly friendly dog tore into my friends cousin one day, absolutely out of nowhere. he wasnt even near or looking at the dog, it just pounced on him and ripped his face open.

theyre usually great animals but some just snap for no reason, cant trust em"
1731,Because lots of dogs just do that.  They're dumb animals that attack shit because it's in their nature.
1732,Pit bull
1733,The breed.
1734,"Yeah wtf why not just give the cat a cat award. Make a ""Most heroic cat"" of the year award, even if you just hand it out for this one year."
1735,Tell PETA errybody gotta work. Even the dogs.
1736,Imagine being recognised as such a crappy organisation that people even start to fear living day to day because their guide animal could be taken away.
1737,"That’s horrible, I’m sorry. 

But then how exactly do they come to the conclusion that service animals are abused during training? Like that makes literally no sense at all. 

Not to mention the fact that most (if not all) people who can finally get a service animal probably absolutely adore their animal and everything they do for them. I’d be fucking shocked if it ever came out that somebody with a legitimate condition actually abused their service animal."
1738,Yet they euthanize how many pets a year
1739,"I know there’s lots of controversy about the living conditions of many livestock animals. And I do think it’s horrible the kind of lives chickens live and the conditions they’re kept in. 

And at the same time, harvesting honey literally does not harm a bee at all. Bees are going extinct and play huge roles in pollination. So if we can’t have livestock and consequently have to essentially go vegan, according to their ideals, how the fuck will we grow enough crops to eat without any damn bees to pollinate? 

I’m not a fan of zoos either but like... I’m not off the deep end like most of those groups tend to be."
1740,what a load of shit
1741,YES. ASPCA is reputable.
1742,ASPCA doesn’t bother me when one of their members sees me/follows me home after I leave my dog in a running car for 30 seconds with the AC on full blast to buy him fancy ass apple cinnamon treats from a specialty pet store for being a good boy at the vet.
1743,"wtf your wtf.

Obviously you do not have much experience with Golden Retrievers. All Goldens look that. They are very happy dogs.

Always"
1744,Dogs like these are the reason I have a dashcam! Insurance frawd is *no joke*
1745,"My high school biology teacher was a Phd biologist who had worked for the army doing research on radiation debilitation of animals as a proxy for humans. Goats were their model. The group wanted to know how long an animal (proxy human) could function after receiving a lethal dose. His group found that the best way to motivate the goats was by irradiating a goat that had been separated from its flock and then seeing how long it would go trying to reunite. Truly horrific stuff. But the desire to be back with its family was the strongest motivator that they could find. Animals value family just as much as humans do, sometimes more. The Cold War was horrible and motivated humans to do some truly horrendous shit."
1746,Please tell me your dog ended up being okay. Please?
1747,Why not?
1748,Would.
1749,"he did, he's positive that dogs leg was broken... man read between the lines and outside the box."
1750,Positivity ≠ Obliviousness

1754,"Even more technically, they evolved us"
1755,"Well, one could also argue that we ""devolved"" them. Or how do you explain Chiuahuas (also called the Spawn of Hell)."
1756,"""Who evolved who?"" would make a great bumper sticker."
1757,"Theory of auto-domestication, they evolved themselves before we ever had an idea of breeding and intent."
1758,">Technically we evolved them.

How so?"
1759,Intelligent design is real.
1760,The dog could've moved but it didn't.
1761,Never notice grammar and punctuation till it's gone.
1762,"We helped dogs evolve and they helped us evolve.  Humans and dogs have a long history together. Wolves used to follow humans around, probably in order to get leftovers from kills, then we started working together and that combo allowed us change in a numerous amount of ways."
1763,"If the last sentence is confusing, basically we adapted to each other."
1764,"Or when you put music into braille and they say, ""this shit bumps"""
1765,"I have a 100% blind friend that says ""see ya later"" all the time. It was weird the first few times like, ""wait, is he messing with me?"" But you realize it really is just a colloquium when you see him walk face first into a desk or wall."
1766,I feel you bruh.
1767,That and it's modern language and blind people are allowed to use it. OP commenter doesn't need to nitpick.
1768,"Blindness is more of a scale than a binary.

Legally, *I'm* blind, but absolutely zero people would actually consider me blind."
1769,I was in college with a lady who was supposedly blind. She had a white cane and everything. I once saw her get into a car and drive off.
1770,I had a legally blind student who still learned to identify pictures of her classmates and partially communicate through picture exchange communication(she was nonverbal).
1771,"I say ""look at this"" to my blind cousin (he's like a little brother to me so we have are close) when I want him to grab something or just to touch something because seeing something is touching It for him (and he sais ""let me see"" if he wants to grab something). Only people without knowledge of how blind people behave would be surprised about the use of the word see."
1772,Wouldn't it be more like 😎vs 🤓
1773,"My dog stayed when hit by a car. Then he tried to bite the driver in the ankle. His spine was fucked for a bit, but recovered"

1775,"From that same page:

>At the end of the mandatory 10-day quarantine period, Scrappy was euthanized despite opposition from animal groups and online petitioners.

The dog was tested for rabies, and then when Animal Control realized it didn't and was just aggressive, retards online tried to stop it from being put down.  The hell's wrong with them."

1778,"I came back to look at the comments to see if someone else laughed as hard at how fucking out of place that cheerful subscribe jingle was, I'm crying."
1779,...are you sure you're replying to the right comment?
1780,"I had a cat that would guard the house and yard.  He was a maine coon and siamese mix, both known for dog like behaviour.  25 pounds of tubby big bone fury."
1781,"The difference between cats and dogs is that dogs connect to a pack, while cats connect to individuals. They are just as loyal, only the circle of concern is smaller."
1782,One of the youtube comments says it was to see where the dog went according to an interview with her.
1783,Some people have zero situational awareness.
1784,The dog was put down after this incident.
1785,"Sorry to say, I would have killed the dog if that was my dog.  I suspect that's what happened."
1786,Chill
1787,"My German Shepard was the same when she was little. My mates' kids won her over with treats and now she's old she is great with kids. But I'm always wary when there's children around. Personally, I wouldn't leave a kid unsupervised with any dog, no matter how chill and how well you know it."
1788,"It's also possible the kid had teased it over a period of time and the dog saw its chance to retaliate. Although the dog didn't look extremely hostile (barking, growling, etc) may have just thought it was playing and didn't have the awareness to know kids can't be dragged by the leg 🤷‍♂️

Edit: Ok playing was a bit naive. However, I just meant it wasn't malicious, it wasn't taught attacking a human was bad. My point is, most dogs do not attack children, either they are trained to be aggressive, they are pushed passed their limits by said kid, or they are not trained enough to know better. In my opinion this one wasn't trained enough."
1789,"I mean, what dog isn't euthanized after attacking a child? I feel for the dog who was just following it's instincts (or possibly even it's training), but what else can be done with an animal like that? It's hard enough to find homes for strays without also having to find safe homes for the violent ones."
1790,Yep I was told my wheels make my dog have a desire to hunt or something and it goes kinda crazy. And my dog is like the most innocent dog ever otherwise
1791,That was one of my thoughts too. Maybe the trike was poorly oiled and squeaky which freaked the dog out.
1792,"My pops trains dogs for a living, been that way all my life.

This is never an out of nowhere type of thing."
1793,">some just snap for no reason, cant trust em  
  
  
I'll call BS on this one, you can train and then trust any dog. Anyone who says ""it was a good dog, he never done anything wrong"" is just lying piece of shit."
1794,This is NEVER the correct answer. This dog was a shithead propably because their owners are shitheads. That dog looks like a basic mutt.
1795,Tell peta to get fucked*. I'd lose my shit if someone sjw'ed me over my own dog
1796,This.
1797,"It varies. Seeing eye dogs are the main source, because they have to be reaction-less. There’s a stoic ness associated with them, often called “bomb proof”, which rumors say is done by putting the dogs in super loud rooms, loud noises, essentially that they’re shell shocked into this state. Of course this isn’t the case and anyone who’s seen a SD off duty knows that, but it persists."
1798,"People like to exaggerate when they tell stories. If they’re talking to someone they like and trust, they’re likely to believe their friend’s exaggerations. So they repeat them, and probably add a few exaggerations of their own onto the story. Eventually the story that goes around is twisted far beyond the original. That’s how you get shit like “KFC doesn’t stand for Kentucky fried chicken anymore because they abuse their chickens to the point that they’re no longer legally considered chickens!” (Real thing I’ve heard). In reality it stopped standing for anything because their marketing team decided that was a better choice and while I wouldn’t want to be a factory farmed chicken, they’re still legally chickens. 

I can think of a few more examples that will probably make you say “wut”. From what I can tell they all start with a bunch of people in a bubble telling stories to each other."
1799,"Not enough to make a substantial dent in the population of unwanted domestic animals. 

The simple reality is that there are not enough homes for all the strays that need to be adopted, and the only humane thing to do is give them a painless death. 

The alternative is a life spent in a cage, which denies resources to other animals people might adopt."
1800,"PETA sucks, but they get a bad rap for this. No kill shelters send their animals over to petas shelters to keep their record clean"
1801,"Zoos are actually really legit research/breeding facilities as long as they're actual zoos and not some hillbilly with a tiger. They raise awareness of endangered species, maintain a genetic pool of animals away from poachers, work hard to fulfill natural behaviors, and encourage stewardship. As a veterinarian I have nothing but respect for zoos."
1802,"There are 20,000 species of bee, most of which don’t produce honey. Untold trillions of native bees have been killed by introduced honey bees - which are *not* endangered or under threat - so that we have something to wipe on our toast in the morning. 

Honey bees typically only pollinate one particular species of plant, so when they replace native bee populations the local ecosystem is thrown out of balance.

Commercial bee farms selectively breed bees to increase production, which has lead to the emergence of new and novel diseases that spread from introduced honey bee populations to native populations and other pollinators. 

And harvesting honey absolutely does harm bees. Some commercial beekeepers kill their bees rather than store and feed them during winter, and plenty are accidentally killed during the harvesting process."
1803,Those jerkoffs need to learn how to choose their battles.
1804,"I was in 4h for a few years.  I remember being told Goats are the most social farm animal.  If you have a depressed animal, you get them a goat or two.  I spent countless hours with my friend on her family's farm.  We would take our goats out of the field to train a few times a week.  My goat had a distinct bleet when the herd first greeted us, same way every time but just for the greeting.  Just with us.  Goats are very vocal animals and I swear they have ""words"" for things. 


A Billy goat will also piss on his own face and smile about it, so ymmv.  Goats can have total distinct personalities and are absolutely emotional creatures. 

Thanks for being unwilling bros to our research, radioactive goats."
1805,Go see r/AnimalsBeingBros you'll see a lot of cats (and other nice animals) caring about people ;)
1806,"Even MORE technically, I love all dogs."
1807,"Most technically, it was coevolution of both in parallel. That's why there's a positive oxytocin-releasing feedback loop between dogs and humans when they're gazing at each other whereas there is none when wolves and humans gaze at each other."
1808,No
1809,"There are more Chihuahuas in the world than there are wolves, so from a selective perspective Chihuahuas definitely have evolved from wolves."
1810,Large dogs are often trained to behave well since acting out as a large dog has more effect. Small dogs more often are less strictly trained since they are so small and it is not as big deal if they act out. A Chiuahua can be just as nice as any other dog if it has a good training.
1811,"100 000+ years of selective breeding. Not a single dog today exists as a result of randomness in nature's normal way of evolution.

Every single dog you see, exists because humans wanted them to look like that, and it keeps getting worse. These new breeds of ""purse dogs"" can barely even walk, they just tippy tap around. And people buy them like mad because this completely useless little freak of nature is ""soooo cuuute ommgg!!""

Some breed of dogs have thankfully been kept mostly intact, like the german sheperd, that breed is crazy old. Altho several popular kennel clubs have made it a thing to aquire german sheperd with a growth deficency in their back legs, forcing them to walk around on shorter legs like this one https://youtu.be/_hzs2Ebf-W4"
1812,"> Never notice grammar and punctuation till it's gone.

That instruction was very specific. It will be difficult to not notice something just because you told me to not notice it.

I will do my best."

why would you put music into braille? they're blind not deaf"
1814,Hahaha
1815,"idk man, but if I'd be blind I would be sayin shit like that all the time to fuck with people... that and also walk face first into walls"
1816,"I knew a blind guy who would act super offended whenever other people used colloquialisms like that around him...just to mess with them. While, of, course, using them himself.

Didn't like him much, but it was some pretty effective trolling."
1817,Hm.. OH
1818,I hear yah man.
1819,Have a nice weekend and I'll hear the closeness of you due to how the sound of my voice getting dampened by your body on monday!
1820,"Same with me and being deaf. 

Well that’s a lie plenty of my friends consider me deaf hahaha. But coworkers etc have no idea"
1821,"I feel this. Last i checked i either fell under it or was close, without glasses i cant read even large text from more than about a foot and a half away.

Have walked in front of moving vehicles because i couldnt see them coming outside 15ft, also regularly walk around my house without glasses because i can get by without for some things. Its definitely a scale that most people dont realize extends so far."
1822,"Yup, always have to explain to people that legally speaking I'm blind but i can still use glasses and contacts. I think a lot of people who have normal sight don't realize that at some point it can still be corrected but there's NO WAY your seeing with out assistance. Usually giving people my glasses does the trick."
1823,"Then again, you don’t need a seeing eye dog, do you? It’s pretty clear that he’s at least, pretty close to complete blindness."
1824,I'm illegally blind.
1825,I identity as optically non-binary too.
1826,"One of our residents was at the local government hospital, and was directed by a nurse ""Go there.""
""I can't see where you're pointing; I'm blind.""
""But you have eyes!"" the nurse exclaimed."
1827,"This! 

 I was an aid for blind students on campus and in my training it's specifically stated to not intentionally avoid using words ""see"" or ""look"" etc if it comes up naturally. Since most people would say ""look at this"" to anyone they are talking to, it's completely natural and okay to say it to someone who is blind. 

So the person who is blind in the article saying ""I was happy to see him"" is okay. Just because they don't ""see"" in the traditional sense (pun intended) doesn't mean they aren't ""seeing""."

1831,"You cannot test a live animal for rabies yet. It's in the works, but right now you have to euthanize the animal, then send the brain for testing. What they did was watch him for 10 days. If an animal has been infected with rabies and was at the point where the virus was in its saliva at the time that it bit another animal/person, they should almost certainly die within a week of the incident."
1832,They would prefer it be imprisoned for life for violently attacking a child unprovoked.
1833,"I read that whole article, where does it say Scrappy was tested for rabies? All it says is he was quarantined and determined to be vicious and aggressive."
1834,r/dogfree
1835,"Pretty sure they're referring to the upbeat music at the end with the big ""SUBSCRIBE."""
1836,Me too
1837,That is exactly what I would say in an interview about a situation where I got freaked out and ran off without my kid
1838,"Okay, not a bad idea. But I would probably pick the child up incase if I went around front the dog comes back around the back of the vehicle. I am in no way a jump in to action kind of guy sadly, but I am a get my wife and kids out of harm's way kind of guy."
1839,"As sad as it is, if this hasn’t been trained out of the dog from an impressionable age, those instincts will always prevail. 

Bring the downvotes. It’s true."
1840,That’s a reasonable response to a dog randomly attacking a child. And the dog was euthanized.
1841,Go watch your hentai weeb
1842,"The dog's motive is impossible to determine from this video, but it clearly wasn't playing. The violent head shaking was way too much for playing. This motherfucker was fighting."
1843,"What are you talking about? That dog was hostile as fuck. Just look at his body language pre attack, that’s full on hunting to kill mode, not barking to warn off a threat mode."
1844,"Well everything you said applies to some humans too, yet we don’t kill them."
1845,"Maybe, but you'd think we would at least make an attempt. That's what I think bothers people the most. If you try and fail, you can say you did your best. If you refuse to try, it feels like a hollow excuse."
1846,This has been my experience as well. I chalk it up to folks who aren’t around animals enough to be able to read the subtle signs.
1847,"Not to be argumentative, but i am a dog trainer and once i was bit by a dog that even i didn't see warning signs despite having trained extensively to read canine body language...... However you're correct 99.9% of the time."
1848,"Absolutely agree. Dad was a veterinarian, so I’ve known quite a few dogs. I’ve never heard of a dog attacking someone before the dog was well known to be unstable or giving plenty of forewarning. The only time it’s “out of nowhere” is from either oblivious or malicious owners. The most common of which is ignoring that the dog warned them many times. “Oh, she always growls when people get near her while she’s eating, but this time she just attacked out of no where!” She was literally letting you know every time that she was uncomfortable. If she could speak she would have been saying, “I am going to bite you if you keep messing with my food.”"
1849,"Okay... except 66% of fatal dog attacks in us are pitbulls src: https://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-multi-year-fatality-report-2005-2017.php

1851,"What about the repeated reports of them taking dogs/cats from yards, from homeless people and then euthanizing them?  


PETA is a fucking joke."
1852,"PETA runs shelters where they don't attempt to adopt out pets at all - some 99% of their pets at these shelters are killed. They believe that animals are better off dead, then pets.

 This argument is fair for a regular shelter that has to put down some animals, though. It's just PETA is much more extreme."
1853,Well not all euthanizing shelters are PETA shelters. But yeah whenever I hear a region as gone mostly or totally no kill. I always feel awful since that means they other send them all somewhere else or they flat out refuse to take some animals. Putting more strain elsewhere and people throwing their pets away.
1854,So wait why does peta suck? They’ve done more to make significant steps toward non-human animal welfare than arguably any other individual org in recent history.
1855,"My secondary school for some unknown reason, it was a technology school in Central London, had a few goats. They were right cunts. Hilarious initially but they got old fast. 

One got loose during a PE lesson so my class had to spend 10 minutes chasing it around and trying to get it to leave a music classroom after some idiot opened the door for the goat.

I'm talking wrestling this goat by the horns trying to stay away from the dozen mac pros floating around. 

Still less annoying than the roosters that would never shut up right outside my history room."
1856,Fuck do I have to stop eating goats too now? I need to stop reading these animals facts.
1857,Now that's what I call science 👌

1860,That's what's UP my man
1861,You've never met furry
1862,"Well, I would say they devolved from wolves."
1863,I was mainly talking about their physical traits. They are ugly as fuck and look like something that was born from an unholy union of some demon and a wolf.
1864,I somewhere read that shorthaired chihuahuas are actually still pretty 'wild': that they were found as wild dogs until a century ago or so (and have not been bred into docile dogs yet). As opposed to other dogs which have been bred into their docile characters for centuries. I would be happy if somebody could let me know whether I have been gullible?
1865,"I think he was talking about the many physical ailments that plague the chihuahua. Poor thing, same with bulldogs or those pointy faced dogs (all the breeds to be honest)."
1866,Excellent. Follow orders like a good grammar Nazi.
1867,"WHAT? SPEAK UP PLEASE, I'M MUTE!"
1868,"He was joking, but on a serious note there is sheet music in Braille for blind musicians."
1869,"r/whooooosh

1870,Smell ya later.
1871,They just think you are ignoring them.
1872,"I have a friend whose legally blind without her glasses, but with them she can Drive!?! That sounds scary until you realise the scale of blindness."
1873,"It might vary by state? In mine, 20/200 or worse is considered legally blind. That's around -2.5. I'm like -5.5 in my left eye, and -4.0 in my right eye. Add in a couple complicating factors and I can also function without glasses, at least around the house. I can read text from half a foot or so. 

Sometimes it's nice to take my glasses off my face and just read or do something without them.

Some people do seem to think that vision is just a toggle. Like once you hit some arbitrary point your eyes just stop working. Had a girl ask me if I could see color without my contacts once."
1874,I can only see for 6 inches before everything goes blurry. I've started to wear contacts though and my God the difference.
1875,"Um, no. I don't. I wasn't trying to say the guy didn't qualify, rather I was elaborating that you *can* be blind but still have the ability to see at least some things."
1876,As someone legally blind in one eye this joke was annoying by the time I was 10. I’m pretty sure every single person I’ve told has made an illegally blind joke. Just one of those things people don’t realise is overdone
1877,"You're 2/2 on bad jokes, my guy."

Hey, thanks for saving that kid and all, but we really need you to put some mustard on this 2 seamer here. It's like you're not even trying..."
1882,That was next-level awkward. They really tried to make the cat throw it.
1883,"Thanks for the sauce.  I don't know what I was expecting with a cat throwing out a first pitch, it should have been that, but it wasn't."
1884,That was art.
1885,Okay but what kind of fucking ball was that? It defies the laws of physics
1886,What is life?
1887,The what?
1888,How do you know if was unprovoked? You can't hear what the kid said And you don't know if anything went on before the video started.
1889,Why are you downvoted?  I'm already subbed

And the rabies vaccine hurts too I think. I would be looking for the dog to see if it has his shots, wouldn't want to endure that needle for nothing."
1893,"awards are stupid for a dog, they wouldn’t have a clue wtf is going on, just give them a life supply of doggo treats and be done wit it"
1894,"I'm not expert in ancient humans but I'm pretty sure our ancestors would ""kill the threat"" if it can be done with ease. Could of just been a protective instinct... "" TINY ANIMAL HURT TINY HUMAN MUST KILL UNNGH."" She did walk like a caveman so maybe there is some neanderthal in her."
1895,Maybe there was another kid or someone who she thought was in danger. She was probably in fight or flight and critical thinking takes a backseat usually.
1896,"It was more important to find the dog's owner to sue him, in order to pay for her kid's medical bills."
1897,"I agree. The dog sadly needed to be put down. It was not considered adoptable. I hate to see it happen, but that behavior is inexcusable"
1898,"ugh dude, why weaponize history for this, let people like what they like"
1899,I actually don’t jerk off to hentai but ok. First time I get called a weeb in a hostile way tho. How exciting
1900,Yeah lets not compare dogs and humans my man
1901,"If animal shelters had the kind of funding that US prisons do, we might not have to kill them. But as I said, it's hard enough to find homes for strays. Perfectly nice dogs are put down just for a lack of space. And a dog like this probably couldn't even be around other dogs."
1902,And if you fail … a child gets harmed
1903,"I can understand that mindset, but these people need to think objectively. You're talking about a dog and a child, they're not equal. And who is willing to share in the liability should that animal attack again? I love dogs as much as the next person, it's just at the end of the day, when a dog can become that instantly vicious without any signs, it's really not safe for anyone."
1904,"No, not really, we don't have infinite time and resources to waste on lost causes to make uninformed people feel better about the situation, come on"
1905,"That's actually a terrible example. Getting defensive over food is a characteristic of many breeds, not just individual dogs."
1906,"Shitheads tend to gravitate towards strong breeds. Then they give zero fucks about proper training and socializing.
Pitbulls etc. are shithead magnets and cause maximal damage when owned by a shithead. Not the breed's fault it attracts incompetent dicks."
1907,"These stats are based on bad data, they didn’t do genetic testing on these dogs. Many times a dog will be labeled a pit bull as general label for a mutt. What is true about true pit bulls is that they have a powerful bite and low pain tolerance. So they tend to inflict a lot of damage and do not stop the attack when attacked. So they are dangerous, but they’re not a particularly aggressive breed. If this was a pit bull, the scenario likely would have gone very differently."
1908,Pit bulls aren't a breed.
1909,"That was 2 rogue employees who were then promptly fired.

Think what you want about peta, but be careful what you base your opinions on."
1911,">What about the repeated reports of them taking dogs/cats from yards, from homeless people and then euthanizing them?

This is an officially sanctioned activity organized by PETA? Because anyone can claim to be a PETA activist and go around murdering pets. 

>PETA is a fucking joke.

Whatever you need to tell yourself to be okay with supporting the mass incarceration, exploitation, suffering, and murder of animals so you can have cheap meat."
1912,"Many feel like it's better to euthanize them than have them kept as pets or livestock. Yeah a bit twisted, no I'm not joking."
1913,"Our new mobile game, [Rescue Pets](https://www.rescuepets.site), works with a fantastic rescue called [Dog Gone Seattle](https://www.doggoneseattle.org/). They take dogs about to be euthanized in kill shelters, put them in foster homes until they get adopted, and re-train them or provide medical assistance if necessary. It truly is a wonderful organization.

You're definitely right; a lot of no-kill shelters do turn animals away just to keep their name. I wanted to inspire hope for you, though. There's a lot of people across the country/world working on improving this. 

Our game's goal is to share all the best learnings from different shelters, inspire people to volunteer and take better care of animals, and sponsor animals on their journeys to find forever homes. We just started out, but it's looking promising!"
1914,"As someone who's interested in promoting a stable environment for wild fauna and flora, I'd point to examples where ""liberators"" (not necessarily PETA) have snuck or forced their way in to open up mink farms without further planning. This is a poor idea for several reasons, for one the minks wont just survive on happy energy - they need to eat and in areas where the local fauna haven't adapted to such predators the outcomes can be catastrophic (even for the native, less effective predator fauna).

Secondly, it'd be naive to think that more than a small portion of the released population will be able to at all survive in this newly fucked extremely competitive environment that's not natural in the slightest.

I don't agree with mink farming but if you're gonna go to attack against the businesses the least you can do (unless you wanna make and maintain a shelter for hundreds to thousands of mink) is to as ethically as possible kill all the mink there and then take further action in order to prevent the business owners from purchasing new mink."
1915,"At this point about the only meat I can stomach is chicken, but even that twinges my empathy meter. I try to stick to eggs, cheese, and low food chain fish. TVP has been a god send. You can use it in most ground beef dishes. Just hit the spices and other ingredients heavily. Also, look to Quorn products. Their burgers and sausages are quite good. And the Beyond Burger and Impossible Burger are nearly like meet, if still pricy."

1943,Seriously so many people in this thread
1944,"I'm not saying we dump the dog on some rando and figure it out later. I'm saying let the people who have the resources and time take the opportunity if they choose to. That wasn't even an option, they just took the dog for it's 10 day waiting period and said they wouldn't let anyone try to adopt it and euthanized it."
1945,"No, it’s a good example because it’s easy to train out of dogs as long as you catch it early (when they’re young/ a puppy)."
1946,Being food aggressive is not normal and it’s not breed specific. I’ve seen labs and golden retrievers with food aggression. Usually it’s just one indicator that they’re acting out dominant tendencies because they don’t feel that anyone is in charge. Food aggression is an early sign of an unstable dog and can definitely lead to a bite. I’d recommend getting some help from a professional trainer.
1947,"Thinking PETA is a piece of crap does not equate to being against animal rights.

See I'm very pro animal rights. I just think PETA is not the way to do it and you won't ever see me associated with it. Some days i think the group should be outright banned.

There are plenty of other animal activist groups that aren't a piece of crap or filled with so called ""rogue"" members doing stupid things. Like what PETA was before being filled with morons!"
1948,"Officially sanctioned, yeah....ok. Cause Dubious charities put all their dirt on their official stance. 

And your argument of me supporting murder of animals, because I don't support Peta is a huge dumb ass statement. I'm vegetarian, I'm involved in animal rescue, focusing on house rabbits, dogs and cats. I even did snake rescue for a bit. 

I donate to the African Wildlife Foundaition fighting extinction of animals and the Best friends Animal Society, which actively reduces the amount of animals euthanized by shelters (and PETA) by funding OVER 2,000 rescue and adoption centers in the US.

There are better fucking options and just because I don't support PETA a morally corrupt, dubious at best organization, doesn't mean I support the bullshit you spew. Don't make assumptions you dick."

It isn't the dog's fault, but attempting to rehome it is a complete waste of time. If you're going to be upset, be upset at the owner."
1966,"Food aggression IS normal in dogs, it's just not a desirable trait. I also didn't say anything about it being breed-specific. 

>Usually it’s just one indicator that they’re acting out dominant tendencies because they don’t feel that anyone is in charge. 

Sometimes, this is the case and definitely needs to be addressed. But, your argument seems to be based on it always being the case.

Most dogs eat what their owner feeds them with no control over when they are going to get more. If you were in that boat, you'd get defensive too if someone tried to take something from you. Pretty much any dog will growl if they feel uncomfortable with someone around their food. If the dog sees clear hierarchy with it at the bottom, growling is as far as that will go. Just show the dog their food isn't threatened to put it at ease.  If there are no other signs of aggression, this shouldn't be a issue."

1976,"Yup the post exposure vx protocol is the full vaccine, 1ml per puncture. The idea is to inject the post exposure vaccine as close to the exposure as possible, just a tiny bit closer to the heart since the potential rabies virus will also be heading back to the rest of your circulatory system.   
So.. if you get bit on your hand with multiple punctures.. 1ml per finger puncture, palm of your hand, in between fingers, wherever. I believe the following 3-4 vaccines over the next 2 weeks are just one injection though. So that’s nice."

1990,No one said he was sick
1991,Similarities don't make one thing equal to another. A violent dog has to be put down because shelters don't have enough resources and they also can't be out up for adoption.
1992,"Because it's a dangerous dog, and if some well-meaning idiot fails to rehabilitate the dog (which is extremely likely) it will hurt them or others again. A dog that has been taught wrong, has been traumatised, or has a mental problem takes years of effort to ""fix"" and even then it might snap one day. You can't talk to a dog and understand what it's feeling precisely. It's a waste of time."
1993,"There's probably liability on the ones quarantining the dog. If they release it rather than euthanizing, despite it being a high risk for aggression, and if despite the best efforts of the person taking it in it attacks someone else, that's going to reflect poorly on them. Not just a risk to their job, but also overall public perceptions of their department's ability to manage risk.

I feel you, I have a soft spot for feral cats, those are the ones I want to have a second chance. But it's a much different situation - ferals go out of their way to avoid people, this dog went out of its way to attack one. While yes, it was young, the fact that it attacked so viciously at such a young age is also concerning."

1997,"IIRC didn't women who died in childbirth also go to Valhalla? 

That might be why they're buried with weapons, because they have earned their place there by, in the viking's view having a death honourable enough."
1998,"I heard a discussion about viking graves recently that put everything into perspective. The archaeologist said that it's impossible to tell what burial practices show because the culture and traditions were always changing and what might be true in one area weren't necessarily true in another area.

A weapon in a grave might signify that he person was a warrior, or that the family was showing they were rich and could discard a valuable weapon, or that the weapon was thought cursed, or that there was a family disagreement over who owned the weapon, or because the person might need it in the afterlife, or a variety of other reasons. All we really know is that the weapon was in the grave, not why.

If the woman's bones were actually from that grave, it could indicate that she was a warrior, but it could also indicate that her husband was a noted warrior, or that she had some authority, or any number of other things. It's all conjecture, we're assuming why based on our own reasons, which might not be the reasons for the people in that time period.

It's possible she was a warrior, the idea wasn't foreign to the Norse, but we can't know for sure. We only know that anyone asserting she was definitely a warrior is intentionally lying or has an ideology that won't allow for other possibilities."
1999,"That shouldn’t be that surprising, since they considered them equal’s. But good to know none the less."

2005,"Right, but there’s no reason to specially treat one grave differently from all others, I think."
2006,"Not even close, that is an idealized view perpetuated by historical illiterates.

https://norse-mythology.org/viking-gender-roles/"
2007,"Her chromosomes were XX. If she was trans, she would have consequently identified as a man."
2008,"The article clearly explains how it is almost impossible for the woman to have actually been a fighter.

Furthermore, even if she was (which there is no evidence for), it would be the first example ever found, thus being an extremely rare exception that proves the rule.

The most likely explanation is that she was buried with her husband's possessions after he had died abroad. The article also explains how they have found the graves of children with weapons in them, even though those children clearly were not soldiers. Weapons and armor were expensive symbols of wealth and class during that time, so burying people with those prized possessions of their household makes sense."
2009,The problem with the article is that all the arguments that give can be applied to male tombs too.
2010,"> The most likely explanation is that she was buried with her husband's possessions after he had died abroad.

You have *no* evidence of this at all.

“I’ve never seen this before (waaah) and it probably isn’t her grave (waaah) but if it is, it probably isn’t her stuff (waaah) but if it is, she probably still wasn’t a warrior because women can’t fight anyway (waaah)... BUT IF SHE WAS, SHE WAS THE EXCEPTION (WAAAH)!” All I hear are waaah waaah waaah excuses to ignore evidence that *would* be calmly accepted."
2011,"The article mentions that many men were buried with weapons even when they weren't fighters either. They were symbols of rank in society. 

Also, again, this is the only example of a Scandinavian woman being buried with weapons in all of archaeological history. There are even doubts that her bones were in that tomb, since they were found in the 19th century at that site and mixed up with other bones, as explained in the article. However, even if she was in that tomb, the most likely explanation is that she was buried with her husband's possessions. If by some miracle she really was a warrior, she would be an exceedingly rare exception to the rule. Viking society was completely male-dominated and women were subject to their husbands or fathers. Also a woman fighting in melee combat would be at an extreme disadvantage, which is one of the many reasons that they haven't been fighters in almost all cultures throughout history."
2012,"That explanation was discussed in the article and makes a lot more sense based on what we know about the Viking era and human civilization in general during the middle ages.

As mentioned in the article, children and men who were not warriors have also been discovered buried with weapons and armor. They were status symbols. 

As Jesch (a female archaeologist and historian) says, it is far more likely that people are seeing what they want to see with this case and jumping to conclusions, despite the overwhelming evidence from all other sources that women were not treated as equals and were especially not warriors. The burden of proof is on the people that desperately want this to be true, not the longstanding consensus that it is not."

But hey, Annalee Newitz (author of the Ars technica article) probably knows this best of all?"
2015,"It’s *complete* speculation though and as far as I’m aware, there’s no evidence at all that Viking women were buried with her husband’s belongings. Got any examples of research to the contrary? The researchers say we’ve seen this before, it was her grave, and she was a warrior."
2016,"The part you quoted isn't really relevant to their argument, they're not suggesting that it's not a woman's grave, they're suggesting it's not a warrior's grave.


As prevalent as female warriors were in folklore, I don't really see why it's controversial to assume that a handful actually existed."
2017,"I don’t know who you’re referring to but DireDistress questioned whether this was the right individual. I don’t believe anyone is questioning that this is a warrior’s grave, that’s quite obviously correct. The grave has been identified as a warrior’s grave for 142 years, from Stolpe to today."
2018,That's weird because following through their posts it sounded to me like they were offering the theory that it was a woman buried with their warrior husband's possessions. Noted by them literally saying that and also comparing it to children having been found with weapons as well.

2051,His estimated odds of winning were 42-1. His record going in was 29–4–1.
2052,Yeah 42 to 1 were the longshot odds.
2053,"Super Macho Man, Mr. Sandman, Bald Bull."
2054,"Ali was arguably not even the best of his era, Tyson was unquestionably the best of his."
2055,"Ohhhh, that makes more sense. 

I just remembered Tyson being KO'd by a nobody."
2056,"Ali won Olympic Gold.

Like I said, name a few of Tyson's impressive wins."
2057,"Ali was an all time great but had rivals, Tyson had no rival in his prime."
2058,Had this happen to my next door neighbor about 10 years ago while we were shoveling together. Died before he hit the ground. I was the last person he ever spoke to. Creeped me out for years every time it snowed. I went out and got a snowblower after a while and still snowblow his widows driveway and walk every time.
2059,I believe the reasons shovelling snow triggers heart attacks are the exertion of lifting raises blood pressure coupled with cold air constricting the vascular system. In most cardio rehab classes participants are forbidden from lifting beyond chest height.
2060,"As a cardiology nurse in Canada, I can confirm this. Winter is always our busy season, and one of the cardiologists once said to a patient (who had an MI while shoveling snow), ""When we see there is heavy snowfall, we know we're going to have a busy day."" When I give reports to the next shift and start it with, ""So Mr. Jones was shoveling snow..."" and the other nurse will laugh because we know exactly how this story is going to go."
2061,"My grandfather did not die of a heart attack while shoveling snow.  He actually finished shoveling the driveway.  He died of a heart attack after going inside, taking off his boots, and sitting down in his chair.


Was kind of a weird feeling parking my car in that shoveled driveway when we all got to the house."
2062,Theres only so many times one can shovel 10 millions tons of white bullshit out of the driveway
2063,"Tldr: Shoveling snow is really hard. So if you're 40+ and haven't exerted yourself all year, hire someone."
2064,"Well, it's the only physical exercise they've done all year and they're only doing it now so they can drive to get food and continue to live."
2065,"Mostly it's the rage at having to shovel 3 times per day...


&nbsp;


Sincerely,

Anyone who has actually lived in snow..."
2066,This makes sense as hard work can trigger them and you essencialy are lifting a bucket of water on a 4 foot stick
2067,Just general advice especially for older or “unhealthy“ people do not start a rigourous excercise program off the bat. You will need a longer warm up period and a longer cool down period. Unusually in many cases heart attacks occur after sudden physical excercise.
2068,"If it's a really heavy snow and you're not found, at least your body is already on ice."
2069,"At my work, we have to pass a fitness test simulating the act of shoveling snow for 5 minutes straight. Your heart rate can’t go past a certain threshold or you fail. They simulate this by using a shovel with a 5 lb weight on the end having you go through the motion. It’s cold, snowy, and remote so this is a necessity in the event of an emergency."
2070,"Commonly, this is because people tend to pick up the snow by the bottom. If there's been a heavy snowfall and you're out there shoveling, you don't have to go all the way down to the ground. You can shovel the same spot twice or more without over-exerting yourself.  


Does it take longer? You bet.  


Will it kill you? Not likely.  


Shoveling the drive is one of those deceptively dangerous things that we don't really think about. If you're not active at all and you suddenly go from couch to 1,000 10lb lifts a minute, you're heart's gonna crap out on you.  


Water is heavy. Like super heavy. Like holy shit how is that so god damn heavy...heavy."
2071,"Basically any sudden strenuous exercise when you aren't used to it can cause heart issues.  (and no, those leisurely jogs on the treadmill last January don't count)"
2072,"When I was a kid I was shoveling during the biggest snowstorm we had ever seen. I felt like my heart was flying out of my chest and feared a heart attack, as a kid. I would never shovel deep snow. Lots of guys looking to make extra money around who do it smarter and better than me and know how to pace themselves."
2073,"6 years ago I was shoveling snow went down. I woke up in the snow called my mom she took me to the hospital they determined it was nothing sent me home a few hrs later. Followed up with my primary doctor. In the subsequent months I had a cardiologist, neurologist and my doctor ran a battery of tests why I kept falling down. The snow incidents was about the only time I lost consciousness the rest were more like ""grey outs"" everything around me stopped and it felt like I had to reboot come back online. My entire family has witnessed this but my doctors still made me feel like I was making it up. That summer I publicly fell on my friend at a concert the band called me out ""oohh somebody had too much to drink"" I was so embarrassed. That summer my neurologist had given up the MRI led no results I stopped going to appointments just gave up. From time to time I still have these ""episodes"" however we're all better at knowing triggers and being on the alert. They're fewer and far between now without any treatment. 

Doctors of Reddit ideas? I'd really like to get to the bottom of this normal people don't just stop talking slur and lean over mid conversation."
2074,"When you go from lifting nothing on a daily basis to lifting hundreds of pounds of snow, you’re gonna have a bad time."
2075,"Omg. We moved away from a snowy New England place because my dad didn’t want to shovel snow anymore, he was recuperating from a triple bypass surgery. Maybe we dodged a huge fucking bullet. Wow."
2076,"Every time it snows I worry about my Father. I've tried to get over to his place before he's had a chance to shovel, but he always gets to it before me."
2077,"Yeah, people do nothing all year long and then suddenly think they can do 30 minutes of hard exercise and heavy lifting. Everyone underestimates snow."
2078,This is how my house ended up on the market. Previous owner was shoveling my driveway and suffered a massive heart attack. Made it to the hospital to fight for a day then passed. I think of him everytime I snowblow.
2079,Few years ago a guy from work was shovelling then didn’t feel well. Went for a nap and never woke up. Early to mid 40s smh.
2080,This is why you use a flamethrower.
2081,"Wouldn't that just be a symptom, rather than the actual cause? I mean, if you forced everyone, who has to shovel snow in winter, into the gym, you'd probably end up with the headline ""Going to the gym is a know trigger for heart attacks."". Or am I thinking about this wrong? Is there sth different about shoveling snow from a medical point of view?"
2082,This happened to my grandpa
2083,"We also have ""heart attack snow"".  It's the deceptively heavier wetter stuff."
2084,What other known heart attack triggers are there?
2085,This is why I shovel in segments.  I never shovel the sidewalk and driveway in one sum.
2086,"Makes sense... it kind of forces people to be active where they normally wouldn't, especially elderly that live alone. The shit can get heavy too."
2087,Because people don’t do anything for exercise and then they go out and throw 10lbs of snow over their shoulder multiple times as fast as they can.
2088,Someone called me weak when I hired a guy to do my driveway. Hell ya I’m weak but also alive.
2089,"I got a visual migrain (my first and only one so far)  last winter after shovelling. I was home alone with my two young kids, and my husband was away on business. The mail carrier had left a note saying I needed to clear the walkway and sidewal or else they’d suspend my mail service. So I shovelled that shit in record time while my kids watched from the window. 20 minutes later I started getting this weird kaleidoscope in my vision, but zero pain (no headache at all).  I was trying to read to my son and I couldn’t see the letters anymore. It was pretty scary. I was just about to call someone for help when it started to clear up on it’s own, after about 10 minutes. 

That’s the day I discovered what a visual migrain was."
2090,I shoveled 2.5 feet of snow in a driveway that was 60 feet long once and I thought I was gonna die.
2091,"With the aging boomer demographic, if your parents live in snowy weather, try to convince them to buy a snowblower or hire someone.

My chiropractor died while shovelling.

I was convinced it was going to happen to me too, so I moved someplace warm"
2092,"Yes. Especially why you shouldn't let elderly people do it. Shovelling snow is known as a static exercise because it requires instant full use of your circulatory system. In older people this means your heart that is probably working slower than necessary for this type of thing, is put to full throttle, it will try to accommodate the demand from your muscles and as a result can lead to a heart attack because of being over worked."
2093,That's why I got a snowblower but I'm still risking it.
2094,Shovel type also plays a role in this
2095,I almost gave myself a heart attack chopping wood. Holy shit it was scary. I had to walk around to decompress. Exercise daily people.
2096,Figured out that the repeated 'seizing' core compression that you do to lift snow is a huge part of why this is.
2097,Like cutting grass in Florida during the summer. Our emergency departments fill up
2098,This is true. What's funny is all other admissions go way down because people  stay home.
2099,"After you have a heart attack, standard discharge instructions used to include no more shoveling snow or changing a car tire on your own."
2100,"I learned that this is how my great grandfather died. I had a heart attack myself last February at 39. I wasn't shoveling snow at the time, but I was doing it every other day since it was winter. My wife is convinced this is what will kill me, so we started hiring others to do it now. Just not worth the risk. Freaking snow is 3 ft deep in my yard now, I hate living where it's so cold it doesn't melt from Nov-May, just piles on, and on, and on each time."
2101,"I heard you can be fined for not shoveling snow. That seems a bit crazy to me. It falls from the sky, why should I have to shovel it?"
2102,Up here they call it “heart attack snow”
2103,"Can confirm.  Been a paramedic since 2007 in northern Illinois. Definitely a thing we refer to as 'heart attack snow'. Typically it's the super wet, almost slush stuff."
2104,"That's how my grandpa went, and my dad lived through his.  


One of the many reasons I don't bother shoveling."
2105,Also strokes. It’s very  bi physically demanding work. I think people don’t realize how heavy snow can get.
2106,I finally bought a small snowblower last winter to not have to deal with shoveling anymore.  Don’t know how I lived in the upper Midwest without one.
2107,And that's why you move to Florida when you get old.
2108,As a Texan I have no idea what snow shoveling is like? Is it as common as mowing your lawn? Is it just part of life?
2109,Well big fat Americans and physical exertion are a bad combination.
2110,"Confirmed, we live in a snowy place, and wife works in the hospital.  Also, when we are getting lots of rain after having a snow build up, there are always incidents related to people falling off roofs they are shoveling."
2111,"Happened to a buddy's concierge a few weeks ago. Basically the caretaker for his apartment building he was renting out was a 94 year old dude he had in there for a few years.

&#x200B;

One day on a particularly heavy and wet snowfall, the guy shoveled himself to death in front of the whole building. Not sad really, dying at 94 of a heart attack is way better than dementia or other old people illness like that."
2112,"Boiled down: 

Older people who barely (or rarely) exercise, are more susceptible to heart attacks. Shoveling deep snow is essentially exercise."
2113,"Cardiac Season starts around fall, when summer coach potatoes have to start raking leaves until the last of the major snowfalls. Great overtime for nurses!"
2114,"People get old and stop exercising. Don't become a lump, stay active"
2115,Damn that sucks this is my number one dance move
2116,I wanna die in the summer
2117,This has to be partially linked to the fact that obesity and lack of exercise and cheese addiction is common in the  mid-west and then snow hits and you gotta start heaving shit for an hour. Surprised more of my neighbors aren't turning up now that you mention it.
2118,"It's like if you have a terrible diet and don't work out, a sudden bout of vigorous exercise in extreme weather is a bad idea. WEEEEEEEEEEEEIRD!"
2119,This explains everything...
2120,This is how my great grandad died in Canada.
2121,I'd be totally fine with this. Days I get to shovel are great days. Goodness I like shoveling snow.
2122,Can confirm. That's how my grampy died.
2123,There's also an increase in severed fingers during the winter months.
2124,It took my grandfather.
2125,because shoveling snow is hard ass work! duh
2126,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeb5LdAyLC8
2127,But why
2128,Wow...are there other known triggers? I'd like really like to know
2129,"Canada be like:
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀"
2130,This is why exercise is important.....
2131,HAPPY FRIGGIN CAKE DAY YOU BEAUTIFUL HUMAN
2132,snow: the silent killer.
2133,Don’t let my dad see this so he has an excuse to make me shovel snow
2134,">I'd rather rot in the ground

-Your body, when you start shoveling snow"
2135,Two of my relatives died from this.
2136,Could someone tell me the reasons why shoveling snow can make a person have a heart attack? I was born and raised California and am genuinely curious! I've never heard about this before.
2137,"The 30+ years of the cheeseburgers beforehand were not held accountable 

Big Mac is smiling all the way to the bank."
2138,Who else thought shoving snow was a metaphor for coke?
2139,"When my mother and aunt were children, their father had a heart attack while shoveling after a large storm"
2140,"I'll add this in the list of ""shit I'm glad I don't have to worry about"" as a Californian"
2141,"What is it about shoveling snow that affects people? I took shoveling as a rather normal experience so long as one doesn't over exert themselves like any other exercise. 

I'm guessing theres more to it than that though, huh?"
2142,Whats even funnier is the BOTH the American Heart and Diabetes associations recommend shoveling snow as a way to stay active during the winter months.
2143,"My grandma'sdied from a heart attack while shoveling snow.. She was watching tv and outa yhe corner of her eye out the window she saw him faceplant.. He was dead b4 the ambulance came

The guy was in his early 60s, super good health as far as i knew.. He ran a ton and looked in super good physical shape.. His wife was a smoke show n his daughter is even better looking... And his daughters a doctor.. Full package"
2144,I think part of it is due to breathing in freezing air while exerting yourself.
2145,"Consider that today's people in general aren't used to manual labor. 

Then have them do possibly several hours worth of heavy manual labor at a drop of a hat... It's surefire way to kill off some people with more questionable life choices."
2146,Got a hernia shovelling snow a few years back. Can confirm snow shovelling bad for your health.
2147,"LPT:  while its snowing, get out there and shovel every couple hours.  It's a lot easier than waiting and having to shovel 3 feet of snow."
2148," I once worked with a fellow who was with the company for nearly 40 years. Company decides to buy out all the field techs and he gets offered a package of over $200k. He decides to take it and retire a couple years early. 

That weekend he had a heart attack shoveling snow and died. Fuck life and it's cruel twists of fate sometimes."
2149,"It's not the shoveling snow, it's the novel physical exertion that unfit individuals aren't used to."
2150,"Well, now I'm looking forward to the next blizzard."
2151,"I figured it was because of the sudden intense physical activity, but I was surprised that snowblowers also were bad for it."
2152,"Soon they will sell robots that will shovel snow.
Or tools that work electrically."
2153,"That's crazy. My grandpa died of a heart attack after shoveling snow. Shoveled the drive, laid down on the couch and died."
2154,"Given, I have a fractured spine, but the first time I threw out my back was shoveling snow when I was 15ish. Evil, evil activity health wise"
2155,I wonder if most of the senate doesn't have special business underwearables.  One less thing to worry their tiny hearts about.
2156,"Trust me; of all the ways to die, face down in a winter snow bank is not the worst. When I was a younger man, I used to think it would be terrible. 

Now, having seen how time wilts and withers people, how cancer chews up bodies, how dementia wears down families, a simple cardiac arrest isn’t so bad."
2157,"Ironically, the more and more frequently you shovel snow, the fitter and less-likely you will be to die of cardiovascular disease."
2158,"My uncle went out and shoved his driveway back about 7 years ago in Indiana. Came inside and sat down in his recliner afterwords. Aunt found him there a few hours later. The man walked around his neighbor most days, was fairly healthy. Just kicked it after a shoveling."
2159,My uncle died 2 weeks ago.  Same thing.  Widow-maker they called it; he was dead before he hit the ground
2160,Sorry that happened to you. First thing I did when I bought a house is buy a snow blower. Shovelling is the epitome of wasted effort. So much work for a temporary solution to a temporary problem. The fact that I can fully snow blow my property in less than an hour without breaking a sweat is super worth the money.
2161,"Shoveling is especially dangerous, because of the increase of the hearts afterload. This study says that snowfall in general is a risk for heart issues. Maybe because of altered air pressure or humidity"
2162,"Yeah, but his wife is now single so ..."
2163,What did he say
2164,"Maybe if you weren't such a cheap ass and got a snowblower earlier, your neighbor would still be alive today.  Good job, murderer."
2165,Oh snap i just commented.. Basicslly the same thing happened 2 my grandmas neighbor!
2166,It’s because this is the extent of a lot of Americans  physical activity for the year.
2167,"I had a coworker a few years ago collapse in her driveway of a heart attack while shoveling. The heart attack didn't kill her, but nobody was around to help.

She froze to death in her driveway and was found the next morning. 

Everyone was rattled for weeks."
2168,Sorry man :( that's really sad.
2169,You’re a good man.
2170,It's also often the only physical exercise a person has done since last winter.
2171,"I had a coworker who specializes in safety and work related injury tell me that a lot of it’s related to dehydration and overheating as well.  Often we think overheating and dehydration only happen in the heat of summer, but if your bundled up and working hard, it’s easy to over exert yourself quickly.  Be sure to dress in layers and start “peeling” as soon as you begin warming up.  Better to feel a little nippy than start sweating in the cold."
2172,"Me shovelling snow is basically 5 minutes of shovelling, go in and get my inhalor and take a 20 minute break......go do another 5 minutes of shovelling, and so on.  My only complaint about that is that the asthma symptoms would probably mask any heart attack symptoms (I'm female)."
2173,It also doesnt help that cortisal (stress hormone) levels are their highest when you wake up. The reason most heart attacks happen in the morning.
2174,"Huh, I wonder if that’s why it’s so much harder to run in the winter?"
2175,I believe you should have read the article.
2176,There's actually a reflex where coronary arteries will constrict in some older people when the face is exposed to intense cold.
2177,A slight amount of physical exercise in non ideal conditions
2178,"I don't think it's the blood pressure.  Sudden rises in blood pressure can cause a stroke, and chronically elevated blood pressure is bad for the heart.  

It's the heart rate.  Your heart gets blood in between heart beats.  For 99.9% of us, a heart rate of 150 is fine for a finite period of time.  For those of us that are near death due to cardiac disease, the slow down in coronary flow can trigger a massive clot and sudden cardiac death"
2179,"Also, the cold can cause blood to thicken in certain individuals; this can lead to stoke and/or heart attack."
2180,Last snowstorm I took care of 3 NSTEMIs just myself.
2181,Are these mostly over weight people?
2182,"My great grandfather died similarly.  Shoveled, went inside, knelt by his bedside (not sure why or if it was done on purpose) and died there.

He was a religious man so they think he knelt down to pray."
2183,"I'm glad my grandparents live someplace without snow. My grandpa has had multiple heart attacks, and one time drove himself to the hospital. If he were out shoveling, he'd probably finish even if he felt the chest pain early on."
2184,The number of times I’ve considered building a flamethrower after moving to New England....
2185,as a person who doesn't live with snow. Why is it needed to shovel so often? Just moving things out of the way should be done right?
2186,"Thanks, I am going to call snow 'white bullshit' from now on."
2187,"40+? That's not THAT old, son."
2188,If you can find somebody reliable. My cousin is almost 70 and has RA. She usually has to do her own shoveling.
2189,"I try to alleviate stress by swearing the entire time. 

That gets rewarded by falling on my ass. 

Then if I've managed to get my driveway almost finished, the plow truck will certainly be through and push 4,000lbs of hard slush filled with rocks over the last 2 feet.

Wonderful."
2190,"I have a long sidewalk on a corner lot, which absolutely *no one* ever walks on. But I'm still required to shovel it... So fun."
2191,Nothing says fuck you than seeing the plow come by for a third time long after the storm to wing the already plowed and shoveled road back yet again. Shoveling small glaciers with a plastic shovel for seemingly no reason makes the ole blood boil
2192,We avoid it by not removing snow. We groom it and travel around on snowmobiles. I just have to cut steps from my front door up to the driveway where everything is groomed and packed. I can literally ski from my driveway.
2193,"Why do you need to shovel it three times a day? I haven't actually lived in significant snow so I don't understand. Shovel how much? Like just around your door, around the car?"
2194,"Speaking from the UK, Ive only seen that much snow around 2-3 days in the last 20 years and if we get even half of that much, the entire country shuts down anyway so you have nowhere to be"
2195,So your flesh will still be fresh for the local cannibal community?
2196,"> Does it take longer? You bet.

That's the problem, you're freezing your ass off and you just want to get it over with."
2197,The shoveling doesn’t cause heart issues. The stress of shoveling can exacerbate an issue already present such as coronary artery stenosis which then can turn into Acute coronary syndrome
2198,Have you been assessed for epilepsy?
2199,"My sister has epilepsy and it sounds like you're describing seizures. What you call ""grey outs"" sound like a petit mal seizure. You should read about those and see if the symptoms match what you experience(d)."
2200,"Not a doctor, but I’m a medical student. You could be suffering from something like absence seizures. It’s caused by abnormal and intense sudden electrical impulses in the brain. They’re more common in children, but have been known to occur in adults too. I saw that a previous comment mentioned getting an EEG done. Maybe look into that? 

A differential diagnosis might also be cataplexy, which is a sudden episode of muscle weakness that is often triggered by strong emotions. It’s often associated with narcolepsy."
2201,"obligatory not a doctor, but it could be orthostatic hypotension.

I get that sometimes when I stand up. I go completely blind for about 3-5 seconds and then my vision comes back and I'm good. Personally I've never gotten the dizziness or fallen over, but those are also common symptoms.  


However, if it's more like you ""forget"" how to stand and then fall over versus just losing ""control"" and falling over, that would suggest something neurological instead."
2202,Atrial fibrillation.  Get a holter monitor for 30 days.
2203,"My brother had a period of this in his late teens, when he was a student. The eventual diagnosis was some kind of seizures. He was told to take better care of himself (as a student he lived on beer and cornflakes and minimal sleep), was put on a low dose of something for life, and as far as I know has been fine ever since."
2204,My grandmother went through the same exact thing. Doctors ran a bunch of tests. Couldn't find anything.
2205,"Not a doctor, just spitballing. How is your blood sugar?"
2206,Epilepsy. You NEED to get an EEG.
2207,Not a doctor but my first thought is your brain not your heart.
2208,"Same. Bought my dad a snowblower for peace of mind! My dad could easily afford one, but he is too stubborn to get one himself. One of the best purchases I’ve made."
2209,This is the right answer.
2210,"Probably a combination of the age and fitness of people who shovel snow, the cold weather making it harder to tell you're overworking, and your heart/lungs doing overtime. You're moving really slow so you might feel you aren't working that hard until PLOP."
2211,Mine too!
2212,Daylight savings time.
2213,Throwing it over the shoulder sounds awful! Just lift it enough off the ground so you can place it somewhere else!
2214,"I resisted a getting a snowblower until last February when the upper midwest got a huge storm while I was out of town, and my wife had to shovel our house out. We bought a snowblower the next weekend."
2215,"I never thought I had to move much, when you're young you have natural energy. Now I'm 36, average build, but unhealthy af. Room temperature can make me sweat. Any physical activity leaves me out of breath, I have to sit in front of a fan and cool down after getting dressed in the morning for work. Sometimes it feels like my arteries are blocked and can't get enough blood through. I keep wanting to start doing some exercise again, but I don't wanna have a heart attack :(  Don't drink, people."
2216,Cheese addiction? Not the entire Midwest. Only Wisconsin.
2217,"Vegas checking in over here, what's snow?"
2218,"My grandpa went on a 5 day fishing trip with all the boys in the family. They drank, fished and played poker the whole time. When he got home he was on the phone with his life long friend when he had a massive heart attack and that was it. 

I think he had the best last days and would gladly go the same way!"
2219,"Yep. The dead-before-you-hit-the-ground scenario seems fine to me. I’ve got heart disease, cancer and dementia in the family. I’ve seen all three take people out. Heart attack seems by far the most merciful, even if the suddenness can be hard to deal with for those left behind. The withering grind to death and loss of self is not better."
2220,This whole thread is making me sad. My dad was perfectly healthy at 62 his whole life. Just got hit with a crazy cancer diagnosis in November and things are not going well. Still hasn't been able to start chemo yet.
2221,"My grandmother passed today after a decade long battle with Parkinson's, and was in a coma for the last 10 days where every morning they gave her 24 hours to live. When my dad called he told me that this shouldnt all be bad because it was her time, and she isnt in pain anymore. She was a shell of her former self for the past year or so."
2222,"I work in medical. I agree. I'd love to go out in my 50s just doing some good hard exercise, feeling like I'm getting shit done.."
2223,I feel different about that and you would as well if you ever have a heart attack.
2224,Fuck dementia is all I got to say...
2225,"Might be a bitch for a second is so but, yeah overall pretty peaceful. No gore, just dead."
2226,I’m all about avoiding the diaper-applesauce years.
2227,"Dying of cardiac arrest while shoveling snow in the crisp winter morning sounds like one of the best ways to die...I’ve seen and smelled too many nursing homes, too many people in hospice."
2228,"Thank you ... I'm 62 and live in New Brunswick Canada (we immigrated here 14 years ago from a southern US state).

I clean my own driveway, sidewalks and deck after every snowstorm, and I look forward to shoveling snow every winter.

Quite honestly, I'm pretty sick of hearing the advice (if well-meaning) of those who tell me that a snow-shovel is a ""widow-maker"".

And if they find me dead of a massive coronary later this morning (we got about 10cm last night); hey ... I'm ok with that.  I don't want to go out like my Dad.  Oh, wait, he's still living, at 87, with Alzheimer's, in a nursing facility.  Nope. Won't die like that.

Photos I took this morning:

2230,"When you put it like that, it seems like a good way to go, if any way can be called good.

Time does kill everything, probably even itself someday. Even if we achieve immortality, it will never truly be permanent."
2231,"sadly, seasons are... seasonal."
2232,"My granddad was shoveling snow and after going to bed, told the lady he lived with that he wasn't managing to sleep, but it was alright, because he figured he'd manage to get some sleep the next day. Well... He never woke up, so I guess he did."
2233,That might have been during the year Purdue got fined for not calling off class when it was -35 with windchill
2234,I mean... I kinda like the workout. But I'm just outdoorsy.
2235,"I have a really short driveway, it takes me about 20 minutes to clear it."
2236,Sheeeesh
2237,I also choose this guy's single wife.
2238,/r/JesusChristreddit
2239,I also choose the dead guy's wife.
2240,Honestly we were both bitching about the weather. Was one of the rare mid-Atlantic storms we get every couple years. Maybe a 5 minute conversation and he collapsed about 5 minutes after.
2241,"Ain't gonna lie, even I laughed at this one."
2242,"On the one hand, you’re an ass hole because this is obviously still affecting /u/JimmyDrums86. On the other hand, you’re an even bigger ass hole for making me laugh and making me an ass hole too."
2243,"I lol'd

I hope the person that you're responding to sees the humor in this. It's exactly the kind of thing some asshats would say in sincerity."
2244,TIL this is a humorless sub
2245,Snowblowers are fun to use too.
2246,And they usually need to get it done quickly so they push themselves.
2247,"You may be half joking but... I definitely believe many of us live very sedentary lives with only a few events per year or month where we can suddenly massively overexert ourselves. 

Helping a friend move, having to rush up the stairs because the elevator is out, jogging to your airport gate so you don't miss your flight, your kids are finally asleep after screaming for 6 hours straight and your wife gives you an inviting wink, etc.

Shoveling snow is unique out of all of those however, since it is a perfectly deadly combination of an acute burst of exercise, zero/little warm-up, and no opportunities to take breaks. 

If you are helping your friend move no one would bat an eye if you took a 2 minute water break to catch your breath. But when you are shoveling, there's a good chance you are scared of being late to work, still half asleep, pissed that you have to shovel (and therefore less conscious of your safety), and hurriedly lifting hundreds of pounds of water on a big lever arm. 

Yeah that's heart attack city."
2248,"I do regular weightlifting and maintain a healthy weight and shoveling a driveway can *still* be a fairly intensive workout. I don't know how otherwise sedentary people get through it. The heart attack statistic doesn't surprise me, that's for sure."
2249,"That, combined with poor diet."
2250,This
2251,"I know someone who physical rehab and training, literally worked out all day for a living, who needed five stents (3 on the right and 2 on the left) after shoveling snow."
2252,"I'm guessing that's the biggest reason. If it snows a lot, you *have* to do physical activity. Even if you have a snowblower you have to go dig it out and walk around a lot. That's more than a lot of people ever really do."
2253,"Heat is also a good indicator, but is held at bay by the cold."
2254,"Seriously, shoveling is a workout. I usually end up in a t-shirt."
2255,"Also, don't go jogging with a jacket in the middle of the summer. You will not sweat your fat and get thin, that's not how it works. But if you want to die of a heatstroke, then go ahead. I'm not judging."
2256,"I've spent my whole life in cold snowy areas. My LPT on this is to dress cold when you go to shovel, a zip-up sweatshirt should be enough. Don't wear your thick coat, don't put on a bunch of layers.

Most of the time when you have a large snowfall it's not going to be very cold. Maybe at freezing or 10 degrees below it at worst. Sometimes there's oddities where it's pretty frigid in the morning after a large dump.. but not most of the time.

Sure you'll be cold to start with, but you'll warm up pretty quickly. You'll especially be thankful when you don't have to start taking layers off and you're sweatyness makes you cold again because of the moisture in your clothes..."
2257,"Just curious, why would it matter that you're female?

Edit : I see! That's interesting, thank you for enlightening me"
2258,The article mentions the formation of clots caused by high blood pressure but fails to mention other factors. The reason people in cardio rehab are forbidden from lifting above waist or chest height is arm exercises place tremendous strain on the heart. Significantly more strain than running on the treadmill because the heart must overcome gravity and pump blood higher than the heart itself. This coupled with changes in cold weather breathing patterns can dramatically increase blood pressure.
2259,"Nah he's right, that definitely is a big part of it.  

Source:  my cardiologist."
2260,Forgive my ignorance but would a high sustained heart rate combined with poor EF produce conditions similar to A-FIB and this is why clotting is such a risk?
2261,"The patients in question have all sorts of body types, although yes, generally overweight to obese (but not really morbidly obese). In my personal experience, the more common factors amongst them, though, are age (usually 50+ years old) and smoking cigarettes (past or current). Secondary to those, probably family history of cardiac disease. In young people (i.e. younger than 40 years old), there's usually a genetic component or drug abuse.

Seriously, though, just don't smoke. The vast majority of my cardiac patients are smokers or have smoked heavily in the past (yes, even those with normal BMIs and otherwise healthy lifestyles) and it's rare for me to have a cardiac patient who has never smoked. [According to The Heart and Stroke Foundation](https://www.heartandstroke.ca/-/media/pdf-files/canada/other/just-breathe-become-smoke-free-en.ashx), smokers are 3 times more likely to die of cardiac disease than non-smokers, and that increases to 4-8 times if said smoker has high blood pressure and/or high cholesterol (which is probably the majority of older people). That's not even going into the lung diseases you can get from smoking. Cigarettes are horrible. If anyone reading this smokes, please look into quitting!"
2262,"Upvoted you because your question can be offensive but its honest, and It was hidden for me at first, meaning that someone downvoted it, while it's a genuinely normal question"
2263,Flamethrowers are legal. You can buy one.
2264,"It's like raking leaves. You move snow, wind blows it back to where you just shoveled. Sometimes it comes down when the temperature is right around freezing and it's waterlogged, becomes heavy as fuck. Also, snowplows have a tendency to go by after you've finished and pile a bunch of snow back where you just shoveled.

On top of all of that, sometimes it just snows all day. I'd rather shovel a few times while it's not very deep (less weight too!) than have to shovel three feet of snow in the 10 minutes before I need to leave for work."
2265,"You don't need to be THAT old to be THAT out of shape.

And I'm getting to the age where I think twice about whether it's a heart attack or indigestion, gramps."
2266,A 31 year old i knew died shoveling.  Wasnt in bad shape either
2267,old enough though
2268,"My grandfather died in his early 40’s from a heart attack. 


From everything I heard, he was active and healthy."
2269,I know multiple people under 40 that have active jobs including lifting and moving for 8+ hours a day that had cardiac events. Take care of yourself.
2270,"This is why I don't think I would survive in the North, as much as I hate the South. That, and I call people ""honey"" and ""dear"" ."
2271,My car is at the end of a dead end shared driveway. Guess where all the snow gets plowed every morning before I go off to school?
2272,Sometimes you just don't want to deal with 4 billion tons of white bullshit.
2273,Required?  By whom?
2274,"Shovel the entire driveway and the walkway. 

Not to mention clear any cars in the driveway. 

Multiple times because if it’s a heavy snowfall it’s preferable (for some, most?) to shovel lighter loads rather than try to clear a path through 28 inches."
2275,"Like, because it hasn't stopped snowing. And waiting for it to stop and then shoveling? You're gonna have a bad time."
2276,"It often snows for days, if you don't keep on top of it it becomes a huge problem really quickly during heavy snowfall. You won't be able to get your car our. Plus if you get it as close to concrete as you can the sun will melt some of the ice that forms if/when it heats up.

If you walk on snow before you shovel It, or drive on it. It's creates patches of compacted snow that are hard or impossible to get up. Those patches become ice.

TLDR: snow is a pain in the ass"
2277,Otherwise its too deep to shovel after a while. You have to keep up with the pace of the storm.
2278,"I usually just let it all fall, but still have to clear it all. If you drive on snow a bunch it packs down into basically ice. Do this for a few snow falls and you driveway will be higher then the plowed road. Not to mention walking on that uneven, bumpy, and icey driveway for 3 months sounds terrible"
2279,"Not only more snow falling but also the damn plow... You get ten inches of snow with eight more coming? Cool. That plow comes through and leaves you with a rock hard four foot high three feet wide mountain of ice and snow at the end of your driveway locking you and your car in. 


And after you chip through that shit here the plow comes again from a slightly different angle. 


And then there is more snow. Repeat."
2280,"It’s actually best to reduce the body temperature immediately after a MI to protect the body, or so I’ve heard."
2281,"> That's the problem, you're freezing your ass off 

for the first 2-3 minutes. Once you start shoveling, you will start to get warm quite fast."
2282,"And the leading cause of said stenosis? American diet. (causing hypertension, high LDL cholesterol, obesity which are all big risk factors)"
2283,No? No one mentioned seizures or epilepsy. What does assessment involve?
2284,"I was tested for that, nope."
2285,So no POTS...good luck figuring it out
2286,"Had one, nothing out of the ordinary."
2287,I get migraines behind my left eye. They did an MRI but found nothing.
2288,"You should come have a talk with my husband. I've been begging for a snowblower for about 10 years now. He refuses to shovel so that just leaves yours truly. Oh, and we have a corner lot. Fun fun. Soon as we can afford it, I might hire someone."
2289,Last January I just got tired of paying the neighborhood kids to do it.
2290,You should see a doctor about that if you haven't already.
2291,"DDPY, brother"
2292,"My great grandma died in her sleep aged 103. She was in her own home in her own bed. She was independent for her whole life and spent that day as she always did, normal routine, time in the garden, gin and tonic in the evening, then to bed and gone. I can't really think of a better way to go."
2293,"My granddad died of a heart attack at the veteran's club, with a beer in his hand, surrounded by all his war buddies. It's sad because he wasn't very old (early 70s I think), but looking back I'm sure if he had to choose a way to go, it would be exactly that."
2294,"My grandma was in a retirement home when she went. We had been in town for the week and spent time with her, taken her to all of her favorite places, and it had been great. 
The next day they said she woke up, rolled to breakfast in her wheelchair, and then as she left the dining room she passed away and just drifted off, rolling down the hallway. 

It seemed lovely and fitting. I would do it like that if I could. A great holiday with everyone I loved, then time for one last good meal, and I’m ready to drift off into peace."
2295,"That’s beautiful. He had an awesome time with his friends, then went out while talking to his best friend."
2296,I can only hope this is me.
2297,"If it a ""heart attack and your  dead"" scenario, maybe.

My grandpa had several heart attacks in his life, eventually dying of the long term consequences of these 20 years later."
2298,"That's the thing though. Healthy people never get checked up and only go when they have problems. And by then it's too late. 

My mom is super weak and sick all the time so shes constantly getting checked up. My dad is like yours. Really healthy, never gets sick, never gets checked up. Turns out he had high blood pressure though... so gotta watch out. 

Hope your dad makes it through"
2299,"My 90 yo grandma still alive . Jas dementia for years now. She is a shade of her childhood self right now. Luckily she was kind oerson then and she is kind now, still however her caretakers are exchausted."
2300,"In yours 50s? Man come on! That means I'm already halfway through life with that expectancy.  We can stay healthy and happy until at least 70. Come on, do it with me!"
2301,"For me, long enough not to see my kids die. I'll suffer any death if I could guarantee that."
2302,"> feeling like I'm getting shit done..

No, that was how Elvis went out."
2303,How old are you now?
2304,I had a panic attack that caused my heart to hit >130 beats per minute and that shit suuuuucked. So a heart attack sounds like something I never want to do.
2305,"I've had a heart attack, and I'd have ten more and die on the last one before I'd let dementia slowly erode me to nothing. Everyone dies, and from what I've seen, it's best to do it all at once."
2306,New gym idea: Snow shoveling machine.
2307,I think his point is that he stopped shoveling and bought a snowblower out of fear. Which is only making it more likely for him to have a heart attack. Because you cant avoid an increase in blood pressure your entire life.
2308,"Man, I wish I lived somewhere that shut down during snow and/or cold related events. 

The windchill tomorrow morning is supposed to be around -40 and I can hear the wind howling outside as the cold front moves in. The best we get is maybe a bit of a slow day depending on the business, usually because shipping stops long before the city itself does."
2309,I like the workout and I find it kind of relaxing.  I spend all day making decisions so it's kind of therapeutic to just do a mindless task for a while.
2310,Yup that dude sounds soft.
2311,"Hey eating can cause death by strangulation, let's just stop eating and avoid it altogether! I guess giving up exercise is the proper way to avoid heart problems these days. Guess they will be giving up sex too."
2312,"I'm just saying, why plow only the driveway?"
2313,Man I hope my last words are wild. Fukkn weather
2314,"Thanks, guy.  Levity is always good."
2315,"You thought that the snow death was a cold case and admitted your crime ten years later, but we finally got you, sucka, you're going to prison, Greg."
2316,Dark humor is best humor.
2317,he did. and it was great.
2318,And sometimes your wife or neighbors are watching and you want to look capable and strong.
2319,"And since we’ve done it before, pretty much Every year we see no danger.  I’m 50 now and I consider shoveling the snow to be a dangerous activity that requires planning and rest periods.  It’s the rush to finish that gets people I assume."
2320,"They're not really joking at all.

70% of Americans are overweight or obese, with more than half of that group obese. They didn't get that way all while exercising 3x a week. Its because most people do absolutely zero physical activity.

So little that when they actually do some, it kills them."
2321,"I live in a snowy area. We often stretch before shoveling, take breaks, pace ourselves, quit half way through and come back later. It can be good exercise if you approach it properly. Sure you may be late for work but when there is 30cm of new snow everybody is going to be late, including the boss, it’s accepted."
2322,This idea is what made me wanna be more fit. I wasn’t obese but defintley overweight and out of shape. Started BJJ and it made a world of difference.
2323,Lmaoooo ain't no inviting winks after the kids 6 hour crying sesh
2324,"This is why, if shit hit the fan and society crumbled, most people would die just from needing to be more active."
2325,"I bet you do it a lot faster than sedentary people.

I noticed with running it doesn't really get easier, you just become faster."
2326,I'd wager most folks that are out of shape hold their breath when they exert themselves. That tends to increase heart rate which could lead to a heart attack.
2327,"I have recently become an expert at clearing snow from my drive way. 1 push down the center, then work each side separately  pushing only half a shovels width towards the grass."
2328,Girl is on fiiirrrreeeer
2329,"Same here, usually i wear a heavy coat.  After 10 minutes, i throw it back indoors, it ends up feeling like summer while I'm shoveling."
2330,It feels like you're judging tho
2331,Females tend to have atypical symptoms with a heart attack- less so the classic crushing chest pain radiating down the left arm. So she might have symptoms that feel more like an asthma attack which would go unnoticed.
2332,>Women are more likely to have [nontraditional symptoms](https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/heart-disease/heart-attack-and-women/heart-attack-symptoms) of heart attack than men. And women are also more likely to have silent heart attacks.
2333,"Women have different heart attack symptoms than men. Google says for women, shortness of breath is one, which might be mistaken for asthma?"
2334,Different heart attack symptoms for women.  Generally speaking it's not as obvious as the symptoms for men and tend to mimic other aches and pains that are common to middle age.
2335,The symptoms for a heart attack tend to be different for females.
2336,"I think height is sort of a correlation but not causation. Reality is that when you start exercising (regardless of what exercise it is) your whole body will go into ""exercise mode"", which brings vasoconstriction across the whole body. The exception to that is in the local areas of the worked muscle, where a few byproducts will be produced and secreted by the working muscles to induce vasodilation in its local area. While this vasodilation is done primarily to make sure that the working muscle gets all blood it needs, a secondary outcome is a drop in BP. Thus, greater the muscle used greater the drop in BP. This difference is most notable when comparing BP during arm vs. leg workouts; legs are huge and thus the vasodilation they cause makes a huge difference in BP (opposite is true for arms & BP)

Shoveling snow is always underestimated as an exercise but it's far from trivial and most people will prioritize their arms and not utilize their legs, thus causing this huge, prolonged and often deadly spike in BP.

TLDR if you have heart problems and have to shovel some snow take it slow and use your legs"
2337,"Okay, fair enough, the article did mention the cold weather part, but did not mention the raising above the chest part.

E: Thanks for the downvote, I love being kicked after I've admitted that I was wrong and the other person made a good point. Reddit doesn't need more of that 😉"
2338,"Hmm, just spitballing here, but cardio rehab suggests you work with people who've already got CHF or a previous MI or something? In those populations I wouldn't be surprised if something like lifting your arms above your head causes some drastic changes in blood pressure, because their hearts already aren't working that well and are unable to compensate all the extra fluid, but I'm curious if it'd really be all that significant at all in someone with a healthy cardiovascular system. Sorta like how if a 20 year old stands up too quickly after a long time they might feel a little woozy for a second, but an 80 year old patient might literally pass out."
2339,"I have everyone of these. I am a former smoker and former drug abuser. I also have a history of family cardiac disease and I have congenital myocardial bridging. You have scared the living day lights out of me. 

What the hell can I do to help myself not die on my family?"
2340,"They said build. 

Why go small when you can retro fit a 2000 impreza to throw flames at all directions to clear a path."
2341,I'm 29 and am already at that point; Is it a heart attack or am I just really stoned and having indigestion?
2342,"I have a cousin who was thirty-eight who died after a normal day's work on a construction site. He didn't work all the time, but was in the normal BMI. Fell over after telling his brother-in-law ""Oh shit"" and grabbing his chest.

The Mormon family says he said oh crap, but we all know him, and we all know what he said."
2343,"The town, I assume."
2344,"I feel like if I had to do that on the regular, I would lobby a lot harder for public transportation in my area."
2345,">Multiple times because if it’s a heavy snowfall it’s preferable (for some, most?) to shovel lighter loads rather than try to clear a path through 28 inches.

See I am all about the opposite mindset. I would rather shovel 30 inches once than 10 inches three times."
2346,"Like to maintain a minimum level of clearance in key areas?

I didn't think that people waited till it stopped snowing necessarily because I know sometimes the snow can last all winter. But not having dealt with snow before, I somehow imagined it was like a once a day thing, like you clear out for the morning and then yeah some more accumulates thru the day, but you are still able to get in your house after you get home from work? 

What do you do when you have to work and can't be there to do it in the day? Do you just have to dig your way back in your house?

I don't know. That's why I asked."
2347,"Now, I'm wondering how the people on Hoarders in northern states even survive the winter. 

I'm thinking I'm not even a hoarder and I'm bad enough about stuff here in the South, I'd never survive a winter in the North."
2348,"Being from Australia: snow is for skiing on, not for living in. It belongs on a mountain, not your drive-way. Weirdos..."
2349,Usually an EEG (electroencephalogram). The “greying out” that you described sounds like what’s call a Petit Mal (absence seizure). It could also explain a loss of consciousness. It might be worth getting a EEG this usually involves seeing a neurologist. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absence_seizure
2350,"hmm. and you were checked for strokes too? Just saw you said you also slump over and slur mid-convo and that sounds a lot like someone having a stroke.

Maybe transient ischemic attack? They're like mini-strokes that don't cause lasting damage and can often go undetected because of that.

It's possible you have normal blood pressure when you're not physically active and then when you get to moving (like shoveling or rocking out at a concert) your pressure spikes and you have a TIA.

No idea."
2351,"he doesn't want you to buy a snowblower, but he also refuses to shovel it?   ""not only do I want you to do the hard work, I also want it to be as much a struggle as possible!""

I do not believe in unilateral decisions, but... well... let's just say I do now."
2352,"To murder the cheap bastard, you mean?"
2353,"Yeah I used to see those reports like: ""36-year-old father of three suffers heart attack while shuffling a pack of cards"" and be like HOW unhealthy do you have to be? Now I know!"
2354,"My ex is a yoga instructor. I already noped out of that, and I think I hurt her feelings lol"
2355,"My grandfather was 97. His health went down fast, he was independent up until about a week before he died where my Dad went to care for him while a at home carer was sorted. He had been adamant he wouldn't go into a home, but after a few days of Dad caring for him he decided he would go into a home (so as not to a burden on his son) as it was taking too long to sort at home carer. He died peacefully in his sleep his first night there."
2356,I'd rather be awake when I die.  I got to know I'm dead.
2357,"My great grandmas currently 103, what a coincidence!"
2358,"> gin and tonic in the evening,

That's probably her secret- pickling"
2359,I bet she mastered the art of a good g&t
2360,"My grandma died aged 98.

While she did't die at home, like she wanted (didn't make it through a particular hot summer, had to spend her last couple of days in a home for care), she was able to tell her wishes for her funeral to my mom, before not waking up one evening."
2361,"Fuck you're almost describing my grandma...she lived with us, independent tho. Did her normal routine, healthy everything was fine and dandy, she said her goodnight and went to her room to watch the soap. One hour later my mom finds her dead in the chair, TV on, remote in hand and in the exact same position she was when she sat down. We think she dosed off and died...."
2362,My top 3 favourite way to die
2363,"Awesome for him, probably not so awesome for the friend who had to hear it happen."
2364,"I saw a 95 year old once who looked like he was maybe 70 and his coronary arteries were beautiful and open. If I'm not in the same shape as him at 75, I wanna be taken out."
2365,"the old men in my family  all make it well past their 90's, with reasonable body fitness. Incredibly salty Ukrainian diet, lots of rye, and lots of walking. Its consistent, but surprising."
2366,"My father is a GP, he had a patient who at 102 years old quit horseback riding because it was getting too expensive... Still played tennis and swam pretty much every day."
2367,"I love your energy, combined with your enthusiastic comment. And your username. I wish that I felt that optimistic about my future. Or my next decade. Even just now. Sometimes it's a struggle to keep it to just passively suicidal rather than active. 

I don't know of any ascendants of mine that have lived past 74. Most of them weren't having a great time for at least a decade before they left. There was also a combination of geographic and lifestyle factors that worked with genetics to make that happen, I'm sure."
2368,">  We can stay healthy and happy until at least 70.

To quote my recently retired family doc, ""The most important decision you make about your health is when you pick your parents.""

Eat well, be active.  But no one can out run genetics."
2369,Haven't you heard? Life expectancy rates in the US are dropping. You'll be lucky to hit 50 the way shit is going.
2370,"50s is a crazy age to wish to die. That might have seemed old to me before I started working in a place filled with 60 and 70 year olds who are perfectly vital. I can almost guarantee these people giving the age they want to die at will be singing a different tune when they actually reach that age. They'll be praying for just a few more minutes, seconds, anything... Unless they've totally run themselves into the ground and every second is pain."
2371,I hope your kids have a good enough life that they won't mind it.
2372,"That’s funny, I’ve done sports that caused my heart rate to exceed 200 bpm and felt I was having a great time. 150 is a normal rate for jogging"
2373,Man of course it sucked. You had an anxiety attack. Possibly the worst feeling is an anxiety attack. Pure loss of hope. Total despair. That emotional feeling had nothing to do with how an actual heart attack feels like
2374,"Lol I used to have PSVT where my heart rate would hit 200+ (I never found out what my max actually was, my pulse oximeter maxed out at 200 but theyd have to stop my heart with a 12cc injection of adenosine and it usually took 2 tries to reset it). Shit sucks"
2375,"130bpm is fairly standard exercise, it will not cause your heart to rupture. Smoke less weed, be less paranoid."
2376,"I will never understand how a person chooses to live anywhere north of about Oklahoma.  Honestly just blows my mind.  I was born in New Orleans, and I guess I will just be a swamp person forever.  +40 is too cold for me."
2377,A man of principle
2378,I like you
2379,"He's not plowing now, he's blowing. You can't blow a woman."
2380,"As a Black Man, I agree"
2381,I wish my neighbors had that kind of motivation
2382,"I feel sorta lucky that my job requires me to be on my feet and moving for 6 to 8 hours every day, including quite a bit of heavy lifting. I would never say that I’m in great shape; in fact, I’m probably a good 25 pounds overweight. But I feel like at the end of every work day after running around for 8 hours and coming home a bit sweaty and tired, I at least didn’t spend 8 hours sitting in a chair in front of a computer screen. I can’t even imagine how out of shape I would be."
2383,Doesn’t help that a good portion of being awake is working and driving.
2384,"I also live in a fairly snowy area and while that's a great idea, I have never met someone who stretches beforehand. Everything else seems right to me, take breaks when you are at good stopping points, don't stress about work because it's expected, etc. I actually love shoveling and snowblowing. It is so peaceful outside with all of the snow and I like the chill when I get too hot from the exercise. There's also nothing more satisfying than seeing the results at the end."

2390,"It's easier if you go the old pace. If you're always increasing your pace, it won't get much easier. But doing it at the pace you were two years ago, will be much easier cardio-wise (running slower hurts my ankles more)."
2391,"Admittedly, I'm not much a fan of cardio, so that's not helping my case.

I've noticed it being both easier and faster for me than when I was mildly overweight and out of shape though. I find the athleticism and overall quality of life difference is significantly greater than people think, except for those who have seen both sides of the coin. It's the rapid transition from one situation to another that made me truly appreciate how important it can be to stay a healthy weight and maintain a reasonable level of athleticism."

2393,"They're about half the population. Why are their heart attack symptoms ""atypical""? :P

(I guess men have more heart attacks)"
2394,"It is sad that for 50% of the population, heart attack symptoms are considered non traditional."
2395,I wonder what percentage of heart attacks caused by snow shoveling are true heart attacks (STEMI) or Cardiac arrests induced by tachycardia? I'm curious why some individuals can have almost complete blockages and only experience symptoms of sweating and fatigue on exertion while others with only partial blockages can experience a significant MI.
2396,The problem with Reddit is that it used by humans.
2397,"Thoses moments when you feel a slight sharp pain, everything slows down and you can only ask yourself : Is this it?"

2402,"Jesus, fucking Mormons can’t even let the men have his last words."
2403,Whereas I run snow tires and half the time I just drive over the snow instead of dealing with shoveling.
2404,"I think the increased and prolonged exertion associated with clearing the larger volume at one time is potentially more dangerous. 
Neither multiple clearings you get a break in between. Plus with a thinner layer you can shove more snow versus doing more lifting when it accumulates."
2405,"Depends on the type of snow.  Light, fuffy snow, one time is fine.  Wet, heavy snow, as often as you can manage."
2406,Nah. Go out every few hours and you can just plow it by walking with the shovel. Much less time spent and energy exerted than going out when you have a few feet of snow to shovel in one go. If your a smoker just give it a go when you smoke. Pop in your headphones and listen to a few songs.
2407,"It varies greatly from storm to storm. I am lucky that I am a teacher, so most times that we get significant snow, I get a day off and can just wait until it stops to clean up.

If there's a time when it's  storming and I have to go somewhere, it's basically clear out the front porch, then one scoop at a time down the walkway, and finally the driveway (including the mountain of snow at the end of the driveway the plow will leave). Go out and do what you gotta do knowing that when you get home, you get to do it in reverse order (park on the street, clear the driveway, park the car, hit the walkway, hit the porch, go in and get a warm shower)."
2408,"It snows the same way it rains. Not everyday and sometimes a little sometimes a lot.  

If it’s snowing at night some people like to shovel before going to bed in the hopes there’s not much to do in the morning.  If it snows while you’re at work you deal with it when you get home.   

The biggest problem is usually the plowman during a heavy snowfall.  Usually the plow clears residential streets well after everyone has shoveled and leaves a several foot high wall of heavy snow at the bottom of your driveway.  Most of the time that’s the real struggle."
2409,"Most of the time snow is manageable to shovel in the morning or sometimes before and after work. However, a few times a year (depending on where you live and how that winter is going) it just keeps coming down for like 3 days straight. And if you wait until the snow is done for the day, you’re gonna have a bad time"
2410,"Something I havent seen mentioned yet is people will often shovel wet heavy snow because if you don't, and its heavy/wet enough during really cold temps, the snow will just turn into ice after a few hours, and then you are dealing with several inches of ice til the next thaw. It's pretty common where I am to see people up super early in am/late at night to shovel because of this."
2411,"Yes, you had to dig your way back into your house. 

You watch the weather carefully and they give your snowfall vs time of the storm. If you're lucky it snows a bit (1/3) before work and you shovel/blow your way out and hopefully the city and state have done so as well so you get to work. Then during the day the city and state keep the main roads open. If you are really lucky it snowed only about 1/3 during the day, so you can drive into your garage and blow again. And finally 1/3 over the next evening which you take care of the next morning.

But really heavy snowfalls rarely cooperate. I have had to dig my way out in the morning. Fight to get to work, fight to get home, and plow my driveway while my car is on the street, just to be able to get home (dig my way back in). 

One day in particular. I had to go offsite to a manufacturing location, and I was going to give a ride to a female co-worker. Snows heavily overnight. She gets stuck on the road toward my house so I go down and we push her through the snowbank and she gets to my house (I had plowed my long driveway already at 5 am). We drive through crazy conditions, semi's scattered in the ditches the whole way. The manufacturing run goes poorly so we drive home at 2 am. The city has cleared the road I live on leaving a huge snowbank at the entry to my driveway. So I walk to my house, get out my snowblower and clear it so I can drive in and she can drive home. Neighbor called the cops because of the snowblowing noise - the cops were very understanding (also I lived on 1 acre and not very close to them). This was a Friday. Reschedule the manufacturing run for Monday. What happens? Massive snowfall on Sunday night and we repeated the entire process."
2412,"Shoveling 3 inches 3 times is much easier than shoveling 9 inches once. I used to  live somewhere that got 200+ inches of snow a year. I would often times shovel before going to work, shovel when I got home from work so I didn't drive on the snow and pack it down, and then shovel before bed if it snowed a bunch so I had less to shovel in the morning."
2413,Winter days have huge ranges in temperature. It's easier to get snow when it has just fallen or when a warm afternoon loosens it up. If you ignore a big snowfall until the late evening or overnight it can partially melt and reharden into ice/slush and be much more work to shovel. If you drive onto a few inches of snow it can compact it into ice and then it's stuck as a slippery (or even dangerous) driveway until you get a warm afternoon (which could be days or weeks away).
2414,Tell that to the snow on my driveway.
2415,"As a Canadian, I could not agree more."
2416,"Hmm, wonder why this didn't come up. I strongly suspected it's because I'm a big girl (obese) they automatically assumed heart condition. I have a neurologist but he settled on ""migraine without aura"" which never explained it well enough."
2417,"It's weird because he's generally reasonable with everything else.  His arguments are that we can't afford one (I argue that you can find decent ones for sale all the time for comparatively cheap); we don't have room (true, but I bet I could move things around to make room if necessary; and we would only use it 2-3 times a year at the most (maybe, but when we need it; we really need it).  We tried to compromise with an electric snow shovel a couple of years ago, but that thing is only slightly better than useless.  

That's not to say he doesn't go out and dig us out when we get the real lulus that come through every once in awhile (by which I mean over 6""), but I'm still trying to wear him down."

2419,"Losing the will to live isn't just a turn of phrase.

It's relatively common among older folks that when they lose their partner, or someone else close to them, or when they can no longer tend for themselves they can just simply, lose the desire to keep going and just pass."
2420,I'm the opposite. I'd rather die in my sleep. Wouldn't know it would happen and in turn won't panic. There are much worse ways to die and imo dying during sleep is one of the more preferred
2421,If you die in your sleep you will know when you wake up dead.
2422,But you don't know you've fallen asleep?
2423,"I used to be off that mindset, and there is a part of me that does want to be aware while having a peaceful death, but the more I think on it, yeah, I want to be asleep. When I’m dead I won’t remember dying, so might as well go in the easiest way."

2428,"My grandad (southern Italian) drank whiskey, smoked cigars, and ate heaps of bread and pasta everyday. Lived until 91 and still had his wits and mobility right up until the end. I think there are certain genes that work well with certain lifestyles, and science is still figuring it out."
2429,"Shit like this is what I use to convince myself to binge a few times per year. My grandpa lived to 98 years old generally healthy, no dementia, no strokes, still have a respectable amount of hair, and no severe mobility problems (maybe a a sore back or knee some days), while drinking gin or brandy everyday, refuses to eat vegetables at all - only seafood and meat, and occasionally smoked (used to smoke heavily but quit when his children were born). And I see his peers who frown on his vices bent decrepit. The human body is an enigma."

I just don't understand how some people can ignore all of the signs their body gives them, and do.... nothing active?"

2454,"Actually this used to be the case when more men smoked and drank more, but recently the numbers are more equal. Heart attack is the leading cause of death for both genders. Unfortunately for women, their symptoms can look more like other very common problems that isn't taken that seriously, and the pain can feel less acute, and so falls more often under 'I'll wait and see', which is why heart attacks are now more often fatal for women than men.

Medical research has also until recently been very male focused, as they kinda assumed women mostly worked as men did plus some extra bits and minus some others, and it was just so much easier to do research on men when you didn't have to concern yourself with periods and the ensuing hormonal fluctuations playing merry hell with your variables. It took a long time until they started to realize that gender could have a very big effect on how symptoms presented, and that it could affect how people reacted to medicine and treatment too. There is now a lot of catching up to do."
2455,"That might be because men, traditionally, have more heart attacks."

2502,"Pascal's wager creates a false dichotomy, and that's its problem.  It assumes that there are only two options: the Christian god is real, or no gods are real.  It leaves out the possibilities of other gods.  Once you start believing in a god just in case it's real, you start a slippery slope whereby that same logic you ought to believe in every god just in case it's real.  Obviously you can't believe in them all, so how do you pick?  Pascal's wager doesn't help with that."

When your older sitting around a fire with built in coolers can be okay. 

The heating bills and shoveling are a pain. And driving in terrible conditions to get to and from work can be pretty nerve wracking. 

The real plus is that when it’s snowing heavy enough it muffled sound. So if your not ina a crowded place, and especially if your in a rural area, the world gets extremely, almost eerily quiet and the only thing you might hear is the crunch of snow beneath your feet. Plus everything gets coated a clean white snow coating which can be very pretty. Especially the morning after a storm clears and the light reflects of the glistening snow. It’s blissful for those that don’t like the hustle and bustle."

If the driving conditions are bad enough to necessitate AWD, then they're certainly bad enough that you should be buying the proper tires in addition to that.

For what it's worth, my often unplowed driveway runs up a halfway decently sloped (for this area) hill too. The only real issue I'm worried about is running out of ground clearance. I've been plowing a bit with the bumper, but so far we haven't ever gotten enough snow to stop me."

That got him kicked off the expedition (Hermes being the patron god of travelers and all) and the whole war turned into a giant disaster--and Alcibiades defected to the Spartans, and then to the Persians--while banging pretty much every man, woman, and teenage boy in his way."

2921,"Not knowing about this case, I’ve speculated the potential of this for years.  It’s been documented by researchers that there are human chimeras among us who have more than one set of DNA.

I’ve speculated that among rapists and murderers released from prison because of DNA evidence that it’s possible in rare cases a human chimera would test to be innocent when in fact they are not.  This could occur if their genitalia had one set of DNA while their saliva glands had another.  Which by the way, has been proven to exist.  In one case a woman (Karen Keegan) was told her own baby did not belong to her after a DNA test.  When in fact it did.  This occurred because she had multiple sets of DNA in different parts of her body."

Inspiration for numerous fictions serial killers. Hannibal lector in a mask? That’s because Chikatilo had to be in a cage at trial (because he had killed so many people, it was actually for his protection)

This marks the beginning of forensic profiling.

And also it’s the pinnacle of dark comedy for how ridiculously easy getting away with murder must have been. He was an employee white male - no way he could have killed someone! Other people were interrogated, gave false confessions and were executed.

His entire life was a red flag. (Including being unable to have sex with his wife so they agreed that she’d just push his semen inside of her and that’s how they conceived, being fired for being inappropriate with the students, being seen with the first victim with bloody footprints from his home to the river where the body was found...)"

2938,It's not actually very uncommon! Many (if not most or all) people who have been pregnant become chimeras as a result of transporting blood and nutrients back and forth with the fetus. There are even cases where people will develop different skin patterns afterwards. People who have also experienced vanishing twin syndrome are considered chimeras as well. There's been a lot of really interesting research done on the topic.
2939,"There are human chimeras. Honestly they might not be that rare - usually one set of DNA dominates a system (ie reproductive) while the other set of DNA makes up the rest of it.

I know exactly the case you’re talking about. I feel like we watched the same documentary.

My main theory about human chimeras is that most transgendered people are actually chimeras with different DNA making up their reproductive system/brain.

I do believe the different blood type and semen type was actually explained by a different medical anomaly “nonsecretor”"
2940,What? How is this even possible? I'm literally studying DNA now for an exam next week

Silence of the Lambs came out in 1988, the movie - with the iconic mask visual - in 1991. Chikatilo's trial was in the spring and summer of 1992.

“A chimeric human, or human chimera, has two or more populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes. Cells with the ‘extra' genotype might be found in any part of the body, but have not yet been found mixed through all tissues of a body. The extra cell line(s) can be acquired through transplantation, transfusion or transfer of fetal cells into the circulation of the mother, but most frequently chimerism occurs spontaneously during embryogenesis.”"

Gogarty later clarified that the outburst was totally unintentional and not premeditated as some had suggested.

With no familiarity with the Dáil's rules but some with those of other national legislatures, ""Salient Rulings of the Chair"" sounds like a set of precedents responding to previous controversies, rather than a consciously devised list of rules.

That makes this even funnier.  ""Fuck"" was probably absent from the list of forbidden words, not because it would not have been considered unparliamentary earlier in the Dáil's history, but because it is *so obviously* unparliamentary that no member of the Dáil had dared to say it on the floor prior to Gogarty and thus no precedent existed."

3253,"To steal, particularly in a minor or childish way; e.g., *to feck apples from the orchard*. Referring to someone as a ‘fecker’ originally was like calling them a scamp or a tyke."
3254,"""feck"" is basically the word fuck's younger, milder brother. Its for when fuck is too severe for the situation, and is more used when you're impatient/frustrated as opposed to angry/horny, as it doesn't really have any of the sexual tones that the word fuck would have. It's also slang for throw sometimes, but mainly in an annoyed ""I asked him to pass that remote and he fecked it across the room at me"" kinda way."
3255,"Fuck = Fuck You

Feck = Fuck We

3264,"It's an old Viking word. Vikings didn't use 'sh' in words because there was no similar sound in their language. They used 'sk' instead. There's still evidence of that today in that the Norwegian word for ""English"" is ""Engel*sk*"". Same is true of a lot of words that are 'sk' / 'sc' on the continent but 'sh' in English.

Once you've figured out why I went into that, ""blather"" means ""talk (too much)""."

3288,"Unfortunately no, this was done back before 1972 (when Winston Turnbull was an MP and he retired from parliament in ‘72).

3327,"Menwhile German politicians get celebrated in the media for openly insulting newly elected ministers and demanding the immediate resignation of said ministers because they can't handle their preferred candidates losing fair and square.

Ironically, insulting and overthrowing fairly elected people has become somewhat normal in Germany because election results that don't lead to the preferred outcome of the ruling elite is ""an attack on democracy"" or some bullshit."
3328,"You're implying every Republican is a fascist. You're not going to gain any kind of understanding with people of different backgrounds and lifestyles with that kind of attitude. Which is fine if you don't care that you're propagating an ideology that's divisive in nature and does nothing productive towards unifying the people. But if you'd like to see this nation become stronger and less toxic over time I would encourage you to take up an attitude that's more understanding of why people have different views than you and not instigate people in to going to full throttle in to their beliefs by mocking their beliefs. It's ""We, The People"" not ""We, the bi-partisans""."
3329,"It was really bad for the overall economy. Lots of people starved. Lots of people went without for centuries. It really, really sucked when your job went away because all your clients died.

It was *really good* in that it broke down institutions that were horribly oppressive. Oppression tends to be really bad for the economy as well. When the recovery happened like a generation later things were pretty damn good because they didn't have to deal with either. But there were bunches of ways to get the upside without the whole lifetime of suck some people had to deal with."

3337,"It's becoming a pretty brutal insult because of americanisation. You know it's not the literal meaning of the word, calling someone a pussy or a vulva isn't nearly as brutal."
3338,"I mean, calling someone a dick is also an insult (admittedly not a _brutal_ insult). It's got nothing to do with it being a synonym of a body part."

3340,And they say there's no civility in American politics.
3341,"Fucking hell, I knew of it but I never knew it was this vicious:

> Sumner was blinded by his own blood. He staggered up the aisle and, arms outstretched, vainly attempted to defend himself. But then he was an even larger and easier target for Brooks, who continued to beat him across the head, face, and shoulders ""to the full extent of [my] power."" Brooks didn't stop when his cane snapped; he continued thrashing Sumner with the piece which held the gold head. Sumner stumbled and reeled convulsively, ""Oh Lord,"" he gasped ""Oh! Oh!"" Near the end of the attack, Sumner collapsed unconscious, although shortly before he succumbed he ""bellowed like a calf"" according to Brooks. Brooks grabbed the falling Sumner, held him up by the lapel with one hand, and continued to lash out at him with the cane in the other.[12][13] Several other Senators and Representatives attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Edmundson, who yelled at the spectators to leave Brooks and Sumner alone,[14] and Keitt, who brandished his own cane and a pistol, and shouted, ""Let them be!"" and ""Let them alone, God damn you, let them alone!"""
3342,"I thought it roughly translated to ""witless""?

Certainly though, use of feck in the sentence ""Feck off"" is performing an identical function and meaning to ""Fuck off"" in that instance. I think the meaning has shifted"

3346,"Wait, yeet means feck?"
3347,"Actually, it’s because you were a proof of concept re: the oppression of indigenous people *A* by their displacement and replacement by other oppressed and displaced indigenous people *B* who would then continue to oppress *A* on the grounds of defending their new homes.

Also, people started to challenge authority like the Peasants revolt (i am being very simplistic, for all the reasons you say. Mostly poor people had a shite time. Literally,  living in shite).

Plus, all that vacated housing. Nice. Cows and horses getting new homes. Those witches in the next village died.  I mean ... silver linings.  Crop rotation in the 14th century was more considerably widespread."
3364,"In the end, the lack of workers drove up wages, gave workers more power, and allowed for grazing more animals which let more peasants eat meat."
3365,"Because it brought an end to feudalism since with less people each person and their labor was worth a lot more, giving working people much more power than they had previously?"
3366,"The bubonic plague killed 30% - 60% of the European population. It caused a huge labor shortage. Lords would compete for vassals, offering increased benefits and freedoms. It allowed for greater mobility for serfs who were legally attached to the land. The mobility, freedom, and competition stimulated the economy and increased the livelihood of the common person."

But you can't say that the bubonic plague didn't destroy a significant amount of wealth and render many, many people jobless. It was in economic and human terms, a disaster of the highest order. It took people generations to recover.

It was, ultimately, something that benefitted us, but that would be a lot like saying that the World Wars didn't destroy jobs and investments because the EU is now not dominated by hereditary empires, ostensibly communist dictators, and fascists."

3411,"They perform different functions. Nancy Pelosi is the leader of the majority party in the house of representatives. Her role would be more closely related to a prime minister, except she has no executive power, as the executive and legislative branches are seperate in our system where they are performed by the same people in a west minster parliamentary system."
3412,"As mentioned, that's a fairly different role; in parliamentary systems, typically the speaker does not argue for or against anything or vote for or against anything, in order to keep the role relatively nonpartisan; in some representations, they're even removed from the seat count of their party. Whereas the US Speaker of the House very prominently represents their party."
3413,"I mean he is, but like that's not really a response"
3414,The only response that matters is the significant decrease in support for an unpopular government. A  far more eloquent rebuttal than yours.
3415,"It might have had minstrel shows as you contend but it sure didn't have slaves nor an important black population to put the practice to shame. I'm not defending black face, I'm just saying that Canada has it's own taboos.

And you often had to dial (remember the old rotary phones?) several times to even get through. WhatsApp calling is actually pretty amazing and it no longer costs an Arm and a Leg."
3471,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I just did some quick math, and that would only take like 0.25 seconds for my signal to be sent halfway around the world. Which, imo, isnt that bad."
3472,Call someone over WiFi on Hughesnet to get a feel for what they're talking about
3473,TIL people once made phone calls on cell phones.
3474,"We had satellite internet before and it had even worse lag time. Ping to anything was a minimum of 800ms, with 2000ms or more in during peak hours."
3475,"Mmmm, no.

Iridium uses low earth orbits.

It's very expensive."
3476,I used one in the early 1990's in the Army to talk to people in Germany from Iraq and I don't remember lag being an issue.  I was highly impressed by how clear it was.
3477,"Shitty spam article, they didn't even tell the lag time"
3478,Makes conversation awkward.
3479,"Only some of them connect to six geostationary satellites. Those that did did not have ""universal network coverage"". The ones which connect to 114 low Earth orbit satellites have more coverage of the Earth and lower latency."
3480,"Oh, yeah, it's incredibly irritating."
3481,.3 to .5 sec per sat hop. used sat phones when I was in the army and you get use to the lag
3482,"Still, something like texting must be feasible?"
3483,Okay explain this to me please. Apparently satellite phones work but lag. But how come the military has major connection issues? Lone Survivor is a good example.
3484,Besides the fact they're expensive as fuck
3485,So Starlink May be better for this ?
3486,heh maybe elon musk can provide phone coverage with starlink then

3493,"This is why, for hard sci-fi settings where you would need to send messages across interplanetary distances through normal EM waves, it would make more sense to record and send short messages then wait for a response."
3494,"Yeah, I remember in 1980 talking on a connection from Asia to Texas... it was like talking in a 30 foot PVC tube with static and the vague sounds of metallic twanging (probably repeaters at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean).  I really wish someone had made recordings of those early era  overseas calls for posterity.  The only recording I'm aware of is the one in Pink Floyd's ""Young Lust"", and that call had pretty good quality for its time (UK-US probably had some of the more solid connections).

Also the cost, holy smoke. Overseas calls were about $1-2 a minute back then and higher during the day.  It was super easy to run up a $100 bill.  The Internet sure fixed that."
3495,"When you add the lag due to distance to the lag due to network overhead, you're looking at a lag of more like half a second. While this isn't *terrible*, it's noticeable."
3496,"I remember doing AIM calls on dial-up that had latency like that. It wasn't great, but people would find it intolerable nowadays."
3497,"The satellites are in geostationary orbit, that distance has a much longer delay, close to a second one way, and the signal might have to be sent to multiple satellites."
3498,That is a terrible delay.  Fibre FTW.
3499,That’s what we used in Afghanistan.
3500,Because the iridium phones the military uses communicate with low earth orbit satellites. Almost no delay.
3501,.25sec
3502,"yes, that's what I was thinking as well. with all the low orbit internet satellites going up, you have to wonder if it could compete with the cellular networks.... the latency issue of the higher orbit satellites would be gone and they'd have better coverage than anyone... but inside a building/tunnel/anything could be tough."
3503,The antennae are too big - even [massively pro-Musk sources](https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-elon-musk-starlink-user-antennas-ufos/) put the smallest phased-array antennae at roughly the size of pizza boxes. I'm a big fan of Starlink but it's not in the same market as Iridium.
3504,"Yeah, but I imagine cost is only where it is as no-one is using it."

3506,"This is why starlink should be a massive improvement. Their orbits are around 340 miles (550 km) in low Earth orbit, much much closer than geostationary orbit which is 35,786 km (22,236 mi)"

3515,"Well the league that is the CFL was formed in 1906.  

The current NFL formed after the amalgamation with the AFL, which happened well after the CFL formed.

Hence why it’s Super Bowl 55 and Grey Cup 108 next season.

So it older by when the league actually formed, not just name usage. (NFL from the 20s-70s was technically a completely different league.)"

3517,"I think you need to brush up on your football history a bit.  It was called rugby well after rules like forward throwing was introduced. The same organizations have been participating since the early 1900s. Hell the Argonauts are the oldest professional team in North America and were formed in 1873, before the league even formed.

But no matter how you try to spin it the CFL is older. Because if you want to call pre 40s football not football then you have to call pre merger NFL not the NFL."
3518,That actually does seem to be the case in Canada where the early leagues retained the rugby name so I’ll give you that.
3519,"Ya they held onto the Rugby title after the merger that formed the CRU (which would be considered the equivalent to the NFL/AFL merger) until they renamed the league to the CFL.  Hence why it’s considered the older of the two leagues.  I just thought it was an interesting tidbit.

The packers also predate the current NFL league which I think is pretty cool."

3527,">In the post World War II era, DuPont Textiles Fibers Department, which was formed in 1952, became its most popular division, dominating the synthetic fiber market worldwide. At this time, women began to emerge as a significant group of consumers because of their need for underwear and hosiery. DuPont conducted market research to find out what women wanted from textiles, then began developing fibers to meet their needs. The ""need"" was a better fiber solution for women's girdles, which were commonly made of rubber at the time. DuPont became interested in developing a synthetic elastic fiber in the 1930s, which was perfected by chemist Joseph Shivers in 1959. Spandex's transformative nature allowed it to be incorporated into other garments besides girdles and undergarments. DuPont launched an extensive publicity campaign for its Lycra brand, taking advertisements and full-page ads in top women's magazines such as Vogue, Glamour, Harper Bazaar, Mademoiselle, McCalls, Ladies Home Journal, and Good Housekeeping. Fashion's original style icon, Audrey Hepburn helped catapult the brand on and off-screen in the late 1950s; models and actress like Joan Collins and Anne-Margret followed Hepburns aesthetic by posing in Lycra clothing for photo shoots and magazine covers.

This article incorrectly states that Spandex was ""invented in 1958 by chemist Joseph Shivers at DuPont's Benger Laboratory in Waynesboro, Virginia"". Next the line ""The name ""spandex"" is an anagram of the word ""expands"""" Yeah, but that is one of the two reasons, the other of which is the prefix SPAN - which comes from the name Spanjian. The Spanjians were an Armenian family of expert knitters, which is why Dupont asked for their help in inventing Spandex using their stretchy fabric called ""Fiber K"".

3708,"I don't think the title expresses what this is very well.
Its essentially that statistically intelligent alien life should exist. The paradox bit is that if it did it should be everywhere and very easy to detect. It takes a very small amount of time relative to the age of the galaxy for every star to be explored. Even if we're using ships/probes travelling at a small fraction of light speed within just a few million years which is nothing when compared to the thousands of millions of years it took for human life to develop.
We ourselves using nothing but tech we already have could technically achieve it in just a few million years. 

The paradox gets worrying when you think if that's the case why hasn't it happened? If intelligent life is common and could fill the galaxy in a few million years why hasn't it?
The conclusion most people come to is that there's a barrier that stops it.
Perhaps it wipes itself out?
Perhaps 'the first' intelligent life who have spent hundreds of millions of years conserving the galaxy stop others from spreading out?
Maybe AI destroys them all?
Most of the answers don't look good for us!

My 'solution' is that intelligent species don't colonise. It seems like the obvious progression when you consider how fast we colonised earth but I just don't think it happens.
The thing is travelling those distances is difficult, the distances are vast and impracticable to travel no mater what tech you have. Perhaps when an intelligence reaches a point where colonisation becomes a need and a reasonable possibility, the need or the desire to do so at a high cost is gone?
If you imagine where technology will be in as little as say 500 years why would we want to travel to the middle of nowhere? We could be living forever, lives simulated inside machines living the perfect life. Who's going to volunteer the risk of death to do something less exciting than what we can do right here!? really want to explore an alien planet? AI can simulate one for you, even more wondrous that will keep you occupied for as long as you desire."
3709,"If we exist, there SHOULD be more life. Don't need a paradox or a theory to tell me that. The universe is potentially infinite, even if finite it would still be exceptionally large, and implausible to explore to it's entirety. So even if extraterrestrial life exists, the odds of them finding us is like finding a needle in a haystack. They would have to be within the scopes of science fiction to have developed technology that would allow them to cross entire galaxies within minutes or seconds. That alone in of itself is very farfetched but not implausible."
3710,"Earth is still quarantined according to the many books dictated by aliens.

They've been here plenty of times and folks have had many encounters---but they gotta be in stealth mode since they are bending the rules.

Their message is that we need to stop killing each other and our planet.

The Navy released some cool 'UFO' stuff recently, but I'm not much into UFO's---I just like the channeled books which are inspiring and spiritual.

I like 'Talking TO ET's' by Lisette Larkins and The Arcturian Star Chronicles by Patricia Perierra"
3711,The aliens might not want to come here. We don't even have sex robots yet.
3712,"My favorite theory is the one from They're Made out of Meat. Basically, humans are just extremeophiles on the galactic scale, so no one even looks at our solar system with its giant spectral lines for oxygen when they're looking for life. Just like we wouldn't look at one that has no water at all. 

The theory that I think is most likely is just that the vast majority of species just don't care. We currently have at least a dozen species on our planet that are about as smart as humans, but for one reason or another they just don't really want to dedicate themselves to making tools so they can have greater population densities so they can make better tools for greater population densities."
3713,"Fermi Paradox is not a thing at all. It's not a paradox. UfOs have been seen though out history, including this very hour. Aliens have abducted people 100,000s of times.

So therefore the paradox is false, and not a paradox at all."
3714,"The universe might be huge but there are 100,000,000,000 to 300,000,000,000 stars in our galaxy alone.  That's a lot."
3715,"Based on what we know of the universe, if there is alien life out there, it should be hard to not run into them.

Even at sublight speeds and tiny population growth rates, there is more than enough time for them to go from hunter gatherers to galactic ecosystem within a half a galactic rotation."
3716,One explanation could be that someone has to be first.  We could be first.
3717,"If a civilisation lasts long enough then the thought would be that they would eventually undertake interstellar missions, even if just robotic.  Where are they or their probes?"
3718,You can't really extrapolate like that when it comes FTL travel. It's a fundamental law of the universe that you can't exceed that speed. It's not a technological issue.

3721,"Interesting! But if they are indeed prohibited from making contact, isn't dictating a book a surefire way to be found out? I mean, they'd be leaving proof of contact, right?"
3722,"This does not work as a solution for a few reasons.

1. If there is other life out there, it will spread. The universe is billions of years old, a single galactic rotation is enough time to go from hunter gatherers on a single continent, to swarming the entire galaxy. Unless they are all at basically the same phase of development we are in (less than a million years) or before, they would be everywhere.
2. Weather life is made of meat or metal makes no difference at a certain point. Energy consumption and waste heat are going to be the biggest signs of a large civilization. Weather that energy if feeding life as we know it or not will make no difference.
3. There are enough earth like planets out there that we should be swarmed with life like ours. Adding in metal life will just make the paradox worse by adding in even more potential galactic civilizations.
4. Oxygen in this concentrations will seem weird no matter what. Without constant upkeep (ie, life), it would vanish quickly.
5. There are not a dozen species as smart as humans. If a human was as smart as a chimp, they would be considered incapable of living independently and deeply mentally ill."

3728,The question is how to run into them? Our own galaxy is 150k to 200k light years across so just tying to cross it at light speed will take as long as our human species has been around; sublight even longer. Voyager has been traveling for 40 years and just passed into interstellar space.
3729,"and time to die out, and to not exist. even if life is relatively common but FTL does not exist the probabilities seem pretty low even if our civilization makes it another 100,000 years."
3730,"The odds of ""progressing"" from one evolutionary model to another might be astronomically high, so even if virus/bacteria evolve, it might be extremely less likely that they turn into more complex mammalian/reptilian type creatures, and even less likely that they turn into advanced symbolic creatures like ourselves, and then even LESS likely they develop into a large enough structure with enough resources to escape their planet. We really only have our own situation to base predictions on."

3732,"Although its statistically unlikley, that would fit with what we are seeing."

3737,"> There are not a dozen species as smart as humans. If a human was as smart as a chimp, they would be considered incapable of living independently and deeply mentally ill.

As the others are all responding to a joke, something that I think Douglas Adams would get a kick out of, I won't respond to your attempts to prove the joke illogical. 

For the last, I said ""about"". On a scale that includes nematodes and humans, chimps, elephants, and octopuses are way fucking closer to humans. They're all probably at the same level of intelligence that our ancestors were once they got onto the whole, ""Let's start investing all our evolution points into tool making."" path. And those species quite clearly have chosen not to do so. 

And that's pretty much what I expect we'd find if we ever managed to get out among the stars. Lots of planets with a number of critters strikingly smarter than their neighbors, but very few if any species that had bothered to perform enough R&D to make it out of the stone age in the first place, let alone bomb themselves back into it."

>  The question is how to run into them?  

We would run into their colonies. Even if their growth rate was miniscule and their colony ships only travels at 20% the speed of light, they would colonize every star in the galaxy in the blink of an eye on a geologic scale, none the less astronomical."
3742,"What exactly could stop us? We have already crossed the majority of the big hurdles. Nothing on the horizon is truly existential. Global warming is a bump on the road, but no where near extinction level.

3746,"I suppose we don't know how difficult that jump is though. Putting the points into making tools and highly complex social groups could be as rare as the creation of life itself. We have no idea. the only data we do have is that on earth there are several species that could but non do. Even those that pick up a stick and use it as a tool don't go further than that. 
Maybe that next step is rarer than the thousands of steps before it?"
3747,But how would a civilization get the data back from said probes?
3748,How would you even gauge the likelihood of something like this?
3749,"It also takes nearly infinite amounts of energy to transport matter at closer to light speed, as well as proportionally increasing the mass of whatever is moving closer to infinity. Light speed travel seems to be almost mathematically/physically impossible."

Life is pretty robust but the supply chain and level of civilization required to venture into the stars is pretty fragile.  

and even if we get one of those ships out there it's no guarantee we'll spread again or even far enough to find other life. 

it's possible but the horizon is unclear, either way if it does happen it will be long after our deaths."
3752,"Still, there is no reason tool using life needed so long to arise on earth. If out of the hundreds of millions of similar planets with potential for life as we know it out there had life, it would only take one of them reaching our point just a few percent faster for us to see them."
3753,It'd be a long term plan.  Probes could return.  Or they'd have powerful enough transmitters.
3754,"Common sense. For a great filter to work, it has to work on virtually 99.9999% of all civilizations. As of now, no proposed one seems to be even close to that."
3755,"For chem rockets, yes. For mega light sails, its possible but hard. For black hole drives, its easy."
3756,"For individual species, not life.

We have had mass extinction in the pass. Bio diversity went down, but total bio mass barely changed.

The same is happening now. Elephants, rhinos and frogs may die, but within a few million years they will be replaced."
3757,">Mostly ourselves, the planet can't last forever.

It has about a billion years left until the sun totals it. That's plenty of time to get out of here.

>As for space we're talking sleeper ships or generational ships over those distances and they may never find suitable habitat. overall I just don't think we're capable now.

Space is a suitable habitat, asteroids have all the component parts and stars have all the energy we could ever ask for. It's just a matter of having the machinery to turn it into the forms you need it in. Those machines already exist on earth. We just need to get them into space.

> in 200-300 years? maybe, though would humanity make it? would we even be the same there's a dozen different ways we could wipe ourselves out from MAD to rogue AI and there's dozens more that could simply set us back economically where building a giant ship to send out into nothingness simply to spread humanity further isn't on the books. Life is pretty robust but the supply chain and level of civilization required to venture into the stars is pretty fragile.

AI would just replace humanity. MAD is less an less likely to happen as time goes on and detection methods get better.

Economic crashes last a decade or two at most.

If anything it seems like civilizations are more robust than normal animal life. Humans inhabit a larger portion of the earth than cockroaches and rats. We can see most issues coming long in advance and have the tools to deal with them. 

>and even if we get one of those ships out there it's no guarantee we'll spread again or even far enough to find other life.

Over a long time scale life will always grow to fill the carrying capacity of theor surroundings. That will always drive further expansion. It doesn't have to be fast. Even if the colonies each average only one more colony ship per millennia you fill out the entire galaxy in no time at all."
3758,How powerful the transmitters are would have no effect on how much time it would take to get the data back :)
3759,Common sense on unknown stellar events hahahahahaha
3760,"Mega light sails wouldn't work because the increased area in order to collect light would increase its mass, and the greater the mass the harder it is to increase its speed up to light speed. 

And I don't think 'easy' should ever be used in this context. We don't even know if using a black hole driver is possible, let alone feasible to create and the benefits outweigh the costs."
3761,"> Mega light sails wouldn't work because the increased area in order to collect light would increase its mass, and the greater the mass the harder it is to increase its speed up to light speed.

No. Because the light pressure makes it mostly self supporting. Building a sail big enough for 10x the thrust, probably only needs 10x the materials.

> And I don't think 'easy' should ever be used in this context. We don't even know if using a black hole driver is possible, let alone feasible to create and the benefits outweigh the costs.

Of course it's relative. But as long as conservation of momentum and energy still work, you could get around the universe at any fraction of the speed of light you want.

It does require insane start up costs to form the black hole and feeding it is dangerous and a bit tricky, but not out of reach."

""The first Italian Wall lizards arrived in Kansas during the 1950s. Topeka pet store owner Charles Burt imported the lizards – along with a variety of other exotic animals – in a time before the government regulated such items.

When Burt died in the 1960s, the lizards, either by neglect, escape or release, made their way out of the little shop to, of all places, a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. There they found a nice home in a big box air conditioner outside the restaurant and began breeding.

The lizards, known in Italy for dwelling in urban environments, felt right at home in the city, living on insects and basking in the sun. Collins said the lizards’ city dwelling allows for easy access to meals and hiding places.""
