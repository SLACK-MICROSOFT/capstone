"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)",This is why I think an explosion is just ahead: [https://i.imgur.com/3ozEvNF.png](https://i.imgur.com/3ozEvNF.png) My guess is Bitcoin will breka up when with the tightening of the 3D bbands which should happen in 2-8 days from here. We might see a earlier breakout from the falling wedge but remain first in the 3D bband zone and have then the BGD right afterwards. Wondering what will happen with the Alt ratios then... :)

"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)",Wild price predictions - that´s all you can offer for old useless coin like BTC. But this party won´t last forever.
"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)","Then, the Earth was no longer recognizable, and Chimera was born. A radioactive wasteland, almost empty except for the super-structures extending towards the heavens - the Citadels. 33 were created, but only 9 remained fully functional and protected. The underrail system was flawless, but its perfection became a security issue, and the remaining Citadels had to isolate themselves. The year was 2021.. the Mayans were right - we fucked up the math and thought it was mythology.."
"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)","I was stationed at McKing City inside Citadel 004. Every Citadel was a mass of sub cities governed my megacorps who amassed tokens before the bombs and riots started. McKing city was no Starmazon, but we certainly weren't as bad off as Zucker-Burg. It could barely be considered a functional city with the roaming gangs of single-tokeners."

"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)","Hey everyone, i'm posting this because I don't want my fellow redditors losing their money on a P&D scam. I posted the issues Chainlink is facing in the previous daily but thought i'd share it here as well. If you hold this coin it looks like it could be the next bitconnect. Turns out their having server problems, which is a serious concern. How can enterprises trust a company that cannot even keep their product online when it has so few users. Also the fact the team never thought to back up Chainlink on a cloud like google shows they are very stupid.Link: [https://blog.chain.link/weapologize](https://blog.chain.link/weapologize)"

"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)",What are your predictions for the alt market in 2020?
"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)","**My** alts are going to do great. They will create industries and heal the worlds sick babies. *Your* alts though, are going to be a laughing stock.

"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)",I am absolutely stunned with the Brave browser. After maybe 3-4 months of using it I know have forgotten what ads are. There are only a couple of websites I need to disable the ad blocker for them to work. The rest work seamless with the blocker. And I have received 125 BAT from just browsing the internet as I normally do. Incredible. I was able to withdraw these funds today and put them into a Binance wallet. I cant believe how amazing this technology is and how we are getting rewarded for doing what we normally do without the pain of ads. Just amazing technology and something everyone should be using IMO.
"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)","How did you forget about ads, yet earn BAT? Sounds like a lie and a shill"
"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)","I guess if you have never used an adblocker it might seem really good?How can you forget what ads are? They are served to you via brave browser in order for you to earn those BAT you are praising?  In order for you to earn 125 bat, you would have had to have seen hundreds of ads.I cannot remember the last time I saw an ad because I have run ublock origin and umatrix for years. Even my workplace runs uBlock origin and businesses are notoriously behind the times.Brave browser is ok for computer neophytes (and tablet browsers) but it doesn't block all ads, and it's not supposed to - in fact, the entire purpose of BAT is to serve you ads.I say this as I type to you on brave browser from my tablet, dont get me wrong, but I value my browsing time and habits and dont care to see advertisements ever."
"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)",Tldr: heavy bags
"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)","Your comment is very confusing, you either have no ads and no reward, or you have both ads and reward. You don’t get to have no ads but have reward at the same time.Brave is good for privacy newbies, lazy folks, or those who can’t find their favorite add-ons in Firefox. I’ve tried the ad reward and figured the reward was way too small to worth the distraction it caused. And the privacy protection it offers pales to a properly configured Firefox with appropriate add-ons."
"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)",What ever happened with Enigma (ENG)? Any recent updates?
"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)","Community call about networked testnet coming in a couple days . Also just had the hackathon at waterloo. A lot of different use cases for ethereum came from this including a rubber hose for smart contracts and one team increased the speed of Cheese Wizards by 50%. Another team created lootboxes you can buy and sell without seeing the contents. A lot of unintended use cases are being built, including an answer to the problem of defi front running. Can be used not just for transactional privacy but computational privacy (smart contract inputs can be kept secret) Designed to be blockchain agnostic so in theory can be used in conjunction with BTC, LTC, whatever. Was also redesigned to use WASM so blockchains would be less dependent on oracles. And I think some youtube and twitter personalities have started taking interest. Word spreading too fast."

"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)","The major backers, founders and main coin holders of VET fall into this category. Not saying it's a scam, saying that I will not hold VET because of their [direct connection to CCP.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7q17t3/jim_breyer_investing_in_vechain_is_an_absolutely/)The full context here: https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/06/elaine-chao-china-trip-foremost>According to the Times, Chao—who is married to Senate leader Mitch McConnell—wanted federal officials to “coordinate travel arrangements for at least one family member and include relatives in meetings with government officials.” Such requests would be wildly inappropriate for any secretary’s relatives, but were even more so given the Chao family’s business: her father, James Chao, founded Foremost Group, a shipping, trading, and finance company now run by Elaine’s sister Angela Chao. While the company is based in New York, its fleet is, per the Times, “overwhelmingly focused on China,” with roughly 72% of the raw materials it has shipped since early 2018 going to China, cargo that “helps feed” Beijing’s “industrial machine, which manufactures steel products that are a point of dispute in the deepening trade war between” China and the U.S. The company reportedly constructs almost all its vessels in state-owned shipyards in China, some with loans from the Chinese government. Though Chao has not worked for the company since the 1970s, it is the (ongoing) source of her wealth and the political wealth of her husband. In 2008 her father gave the couple a gift of as much as $25 million, while 13 members of the Chao family, including Foremost CEO Angela Chao, have given more than $1 million to McConnell’s campaigns and to PACs tied to him. “She had these relatives who were fairly wealthy and connected to the shipping industry,” a State Department official who was involved in deliberations over the visit told the Times.Key takeaway here:>Though Chao has not worked for the company since the 1970s, it is the (ongoing) source of her wealth and the political wealth of her husband.Foremost CEO Angela Chao, have given more than $1 million to McConnell’s campaigns and to PACs tied to him. “She had these relatives who were fairly wealthy and connected to the shipping industry,” a State Department official who was involved in deliberations over the visit told the Times.With the [Hong Kong protests](https://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/police-brutality-hong-kong-helmets-reporters.jpg), we need to stand with the people up against the nefarious trans-national corporations.
