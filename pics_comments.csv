Then we give billions of dollars in government contracts to US construction companies to go over to the middle East and rebuild everything we helped destroy.

So then we tell Americans it was for freedom, but it was really just about giving multi-million dollar conglomerates and CEOs extra income for the shareholders/politicians."

Assad is doing everything in his power and with the help of their ally Russia to fight Isis and drive them out but it seems everytime they get close to that goal the U.S. airforce has been caught time and time again giving air cover to Isis and attacking sryian troops. U.S. government and Isreal want to take down Assad so they can take over the oil and other resources in the country and they're using Isis as a cover to accomplish that goal.
