For instance if your max is 50k, maybe do 5 payments of 10k. Take them out in cash.\\n\\n- mix the cash into foreign currencies. Definitely not locally, preferably with a shady dealer somewhere that you bus to. Let's say each installment, you mix it into 2k into 5 currencies, euros, norweigan kroner, czech koruna, ukranian hyrivnia and British pound.\\n\\n- fly over to somewhere that isnt related to any of those currencies. Let's say Egypt.\\n\\n- bus into a country that takes each of the currencies you have taken out. No planes, no identification. You want to leave no trail.\\n\\n- convert that money directly into a bitcoin atm. All of them take local cash. You will pay a fee but you will not be tracked in any way.\\n\\n- send your bitcoin to 5 separate wallets. Have these set up beforehand on a computer not related to you or any of your networks that you've used before. Preferably not in your home state or country as well.\\n\\n- mix these bitcoin into Monero.\\n\\n- after exceeding your limit and after a period of time where your bank is asking for loan repayment, reveal that you are indeed a conniving douchebag and declare bankruptcy.\\n\\n- live the rest of your life being hounded by the bank who trusted you to pay back money that you borrowed, but secure on the fact you have a giant pile of monero.\\n\\nAlternatively, you could simply leave your country and live somewhere else, given you have a giant pile of cryptocurrency. Ditch your phone, your reputation and everyone you know and love, because you cant ever speak to any of them again without it being tracked and you being extradited.\\n\\nGood luck.
