What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"I'm a ""stealth cleaner."" At parties and whatnot, while everyone is getting sloppier and sloppier, I'm casually cleaning everything as I go. I round up empties, wipe down spills, clean up leftover food and disgarded plates and replenish with fresh snacks, empty the trash, etc.  Most people probably don't even notice while I'm doing it, and honestly I hardly notice myself doing it sometimes because it's just second nature, but by the end of the night I have to imagine the hosts have a moment where they sit back and say ""Wow! The house doesn't look too bad after such a fun night."" No need to thank me; I'm just doing my duty as a stealth cleaner."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"As someone who has people over a lot not even just for parties... I want you to be my friend. You are the nicest person on the planet. Nothing is worse than clean up the next day. You can spend all day scrubbing that floor but its still going to be sticky when you’re done...You deserve Gold, but I’m a broke college kid."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"Stealth cleaners unite! Love surprising hosts with an empty sink and a rack full of shiny, clean cups."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,thank you for doing it stealthily! whenever i throw a party i take full responsibility and am prepared to clean up when its over and want everyone to just have a good time... ive gotten into arguments with people for overtly cleaning up as that gives an impression that the parties over
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"We used to throw parties almost every weekend for about 5 years. I suspect we had about 3 stealth cleaners among the group.   When they admitted it eventually, they said it worked great as a way to sober up in the wee hours of the morning and be gone before we woke up. Bless their hearts! The perfect party guests!"

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"I work at a tech company. They feed us breakfast and lunch and have a bunch of snacks. At least 3 times a week I'll make a second lunch, wrap it up and give it to the same homeless man I see on the same part of the street I walk down to take the bus home. 3 years so far!"

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"When I was working in retail my parents were struggling financially, I really really wanted to give them cash but they would never take it so I hid money in their clothes and all over the house for them to find it."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,And they took it that way?
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"when my SO and I started going out, she was very against taking money or letting me pay, but I knew she was struggling a bit. Did the same, and she'd let me know how glad she was to find a $5 tucked here or a $10 crumpled up there"

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"It was few years back. A woman was getting on a bus and 20 bulgarian leva fell off her jacket. I didn't have time to warn her, so I took them and put them in her pocket while she was getting on and the doors shut. :D"

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"Taking care of my little brother for ten years... Changing diapers, feed him, take him to the movie, parks, buying him clothes... Everything a parent should do.Don't get me wrong, my parents did what they could and afford, but they and my brother, who now is an adult, never appreciate or thank me for anything. They took as a normal thing to do, like it was my responsibility too."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,Why did it stop after ten years?How old were you when he was born?It is sad and unsurprising that they are not appreciated.Do you ever bring your sacrifice up to them?
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,Thank you
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"Thanks for doing that. I had a big brother who was quite a bit older than me and even though we had a whole and together family, he had to be the man of the house when my dad would work away. He helped raise me, and I consider him a father more than my actual father.Neither of us would have it any other way."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"Whenever my fellow colleagues want to bitch about someone. I always make an excuse to go to the washroom. Even though I have no inclination to go whatsoever. I believe that if someone is willing to bad mouth someone else behind their back, they will most definitely bad-mouth you too and this is something that I don't encourage myself to do."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"If you cant say it to their face, dont say it at all. Your quality of friends will go up. The quality of people around you goes up."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,Sometimes when I go to McDonald’s and there are homeless sitting outside I just order double and then when walking out I just leave it there for them. I try to do it almost in a hurry without even telling them because I’m very introvert and I get very uncomfortable if the homeless guy starts thanking me or people around stop to stare.
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"Fellow introvert here, and yeah, doing a good deed feels nice, but the attention sucks. I once overheard a little girl and her grandmother talk about that the girl couldn´t get a toy because it was too high up on the store shelf, so I stealthily took a box from near the back of the shelf, placed it on the ground where they´d see it if they went to the toy isle, greeted them with a simple ""Hi"" as I passed, and not five seconds later I heard a mix of an impossibly happy girl squealing and her religious grandmother thanking some deity for helping her little angel out."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"Bought about 6 needy people their Christmas wishlist's from the christmas trees in shopping malls with their names on them when I got an insurance settlement.I sadly lost the names of the people I bought the gifts for, but I put the gifts under the trees nonetheless."

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"Each location for the chain grocery store i work at has a Christmas list for a specific family posted in the break room. The idea of course is for the staff to collectively donate all of those items. Three years ago, I went to each nearby location (six stores total) and bought every single remaining item on each list, plus one or two little extra things for each family that I thought were neat.Nobody ever realized who did it except one co-worker who helped me transport everything."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"Someone close to me was about to be kicked out of a job training course that was part of a mental health program because of some problems paying back an old student loan.I got in touch with the mental health people, the job training people, and anyone else I could find who might have some pull and went full Karen on them. They readmitted him and he completed the program and got a good job because of it. I did all this behind his back, which maybe was wrong, but it worked."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"I buy and keep 10 packs of thermal blankets in my car for the winter because it can get cold. Cold enough you don’t even need to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius. I work in an area that’s got its share of homeless so I give them to them. I’m not in a position to give much help, but thermal blankets are cheap and easily packed."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"I do the same thing with snacks, water bottles and food, but having thermal blankets is a good idea during the winter!"

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,Give money and food to the beggars near my job. They are nice people and it's fun to have a little chat with them once in a while.Edit: i don't know how to type.
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"Reminds me of a comedy I once watched, where there was a shoe cleaner who would give advice to his clients while cleaning their shoes. At first it was just a cop, the protagonist of the movie, asking if he had heard of a specific person, and it made enough sense that a shoe cleaner would know a lot of people and overhear a lot of stuff. After the cop was gone, however, a firefighter came by, sirens blaring in the background, and told him of a burning building with people inside where they couldn´t get them out and stuff. The shoe cleaner gave him step by step instructions on how to get the fires under control and save the people inside. In a later scene, after the cop has come and gone again, a doctor comes by and tells him of a patient he has trouble with. Like, he took a break from a surgical procedure or something. Again, the shoe cleaner tells him exactly how he can save the patient. A similar trope can be found in many fantasy settings, such as Skyrim, where beggars are in a lot of cities and are said to be able to eavesdrop on virtually any conversation, because noone wants to pay them any attention. Or, as Mercury Black from RWBY once said: ""If you want to know a city, ask the rats."" I´d really want to know how much gossip beggars have to share, but I don´t like talking to people, so yeah."

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"I used to volunteer at a chess club at my elementary school, by then being in middle school, and I would play games against the better players at the club. When I got close to winning, or when I saw that they were close to winning but needed a little bit of a boost, I would mess up on purpose (for example, move a piece that was protecting my king, then mention audibly under my breath that my king was unprotected in mock frustration) to let the kids win. The sight of their faces lighting up with happiness was quite a sight to see. They would go around to their friends and brag about beating the middle schooler, and I think it definitely made their day."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,I used to work in a biotech firm. My colleague once mixed up the DNA sample sent to him and loaded them into the wrong channel of the DNA sequencer. I waited until the sequencing was completed before renaming the files so that the results would be sent back to the right customers without anyone ever noticing.

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,I love books and baking. I also struggle with depression. Both of those things have helped me get through some really tough times. Earlier this year I donated all of my books and baking supplies to a new sober living house in my community. I haven’t told a single person. I was finally getting to a good place in life and didn’t feel like I needed those things as much anymore. I did cry when I got home and saw all those empty bookshelves but I’m glad I did it. I really hope they have helped the residents of the house because I know they’re dealing with stuff a lot worse than me.

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"I paid for a hotel room and a meal for a woman and her kids who had no where else to go, we’re stuck at a gas station just off I95, and hadn’t eaten all day. She was trying to get away from her abusive husband and was making her way from SC to family in NY.  I also managed to get ahold of a family member of hers in NY who was willing to drive several hours to come pick her up.No one knew I did it except that woman and her kids.  I’ve bought meals or paid for cab rides for people a few times, but that’s the only time I paid for a hotel."

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"When I was about 13 I was riding my bike down our road. It was a dirt road through a forest basically so little to no traffic. As I was riding along, I could smell smoke. I looked to my right and there were small flames on the forest floor next to the road. I jumped off my bike and ghetto stomped the fire for about 2 minutes. I have no clue how it started but I was glad I put it out. My best guess is someone threw a cigarette out there window as they drove by."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"At a store, I once overheard a little girl, probably 4 or 5, ask her grandma if she could have a toy she really wanted. I was standing next to the shelf, looking at some other stuff, and they hadn´t seen me there yet. The grandma had to tell her that the toy was too high up on the shelf, but that she´d buy it for her if they found it somewhere else, because the girl had been so brave lately. I´m a tall guy, and the word ""brave"" implies she went through some sh\*t, so I just reached up, grabbed a box from the back row and put it down next to the shelf, while the girl was sad and her grandma was trying to comfort her. Then I casually walked past them, said ""Hi"", and disappeared behind a corner. I waited there for a bit, both because I had nothing else to do at the time and because part of me wanted the girl to get the toy. The two went around a corner, saw the toy, and while the girl was happy beyond anything I´ve ever imagined possible, the grandma thanked God for helping her little angel out, and it just made me smile the rest of the day."
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"I pick up litter.  No matter where I go when I go out, I pick something up and dispose/recycle it.

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"I heard a dog barking and water splashing at 0400h while I was just about to fall asleep after a long day at work. I live next to a little harbour and had a look outside to see what was happening.The dog was frantically trying to get out but couldn't do it on his own. I tried to turn around and fall asleep hoping the owner would notice but after a minute or 2 I knew I couldn't just let the dog drown so I grabbed some clothes and went out to get him.The dog was scared and everytime I came close it would swim away. After a while I used my phone camera to lure it to me and it worked. I was able to finally grab it by its collar but I wasn't expecting the dog to be so heavy, I fell into the water head first in ice cold water. I held the dog while climbing back up and he bit me in the arm.I held onto him and was able to pull him out. He the proceeded to bite me again and ran away. My phone is now laying on the bottom of the water and I was soaking wet. Got a cold after that nightly dive and wasn't able to work for 2 days.Nobody saw what happend but I am still happy knowing I probably saved that ungrateful dogs life 8)"

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"Back in my church days, I was friends with a kid who was part of a family who everyone in the church loved. They went out of their way to help everyone. If you needed a ride anywhere they were there. If you needed a place to crash, they had a spare room. They never asked for anything in return.Well, when I was visiting, my friend told me he was worried about his dad. Apparently there were layoffs coming, and they barely had enough to pay for bills that month. I noticed they barely had any food in the house, so I called my mom, who called the pastor, who called every family in church. Three hours later, the dad goes outside and see three big coolers of food, and a few bags of general supplies. The only note that was left was ""with love, x"" (x being the name of the church).These weren't the kind of people to be generous to everyone while their own kids went hungry. They just happened to hit a rough patch where layoffs at work and surprise medical bills popped up all out of nowhere within a couple of weeks. Please don't get the wrong idea about them."

I hold onto the loop and stop the one in the middle.  The other two on either side of her stop thinking she stopped on her own; and, barely a second later, the car flies through the red light.

What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"Hey friend, are you okay?"
What's your best unnoticed good deed?,"I have a string of them, all consistent, I help them with money or stuff, they bring hell into my life. The end result is that I no longer help anyone with money or stuff. I can afford to but I won’t, never again. I don’t need to pay to get hell in my life. I can get that for free.I gave a woman who was moving into my apartment, all my furniture, when I moved out of my apartment. She had none and I wasn’t renting ever again. She acted grateful. Then my security deposit was taken, even though I did no damage, paid $350 for professional cleaners, and paid close to $1000 to the maintenance man for taking unwanted stuff to the thrift store and the dump. They won’t tell me why, but let me guess. Maintenance needed the furniture out, I was gone, so she did a swindle with the furniture, claiming I left it, so that the maintenance man had to move it, maybe she paid him to store it, or maybe he just charged my security deposit for storage, because I went there and even though she slammed the door in my face, I saw my furniture. So I gave her all my furniture and she caused me hell.I bought a car for a pregnant woman. She advertised a trailer and I needed one but when I saw hers I said no thank you. She burst out crying that she was pregnant and her boyfriend had left her and she needed a car. So I bought her a car - and dinner. Thank you? Nope. Nothing. Nada. I must’ve owed her.The second worse experience. I met a man in wheelchair, clearly homeless. He lied to me and told me his son had been killed that morning in a traffic accident. I offered to set him up in business and if he was successful, he could repay me. I gave his family - his daughter is at boarding school and he and his wife have a new baby - $2500. That was a gift. I lent him $10,000. On a handshake. He swindled me. He pretended that he was kidnapped and that the kidnappers were going to kill him Monday 8am. I paid the ransom, $2000. His business is successful, so much so that he is now in University studying to be a lawyer. He now has 2 cars and 2 homes. All I ever get from him is that it’s all my fault and he needs more money. He claims now that I never told him it was a loan. Right, maybe I was in love with him. I caused the swindle. Maybe by paying the ransom. I wouldn’t give him MORE money when he needed it. He stays in contact with me, why? I think he thinks I’m going to give him more money. I’m not, and I am going to the police when I have time. I will also be filing suit against him. I didn’t need to pay for that. Everything he ever told me is a lie.The worst experience. I “married” a woman but after the “divorce” found out that everything she ever told me is a lie. And she was married to another man in another country. Which means we were NOT married. But the Republican judge was corrupt (he later got caught and disbarred) and he awarded her, her house and my house, her car and my car, her premarital assets and my premarital assets, awarded her the diamond engagement ring I bought to honor my promise (she committed fraud, she was not available to marry when she accepted my proposal), and awarded her all the marital assets and me all the marital debt, including the money she stole from me and wired overseas. She left me when I was struck by lighting and in CICU, after which I was permanently disabled. Of course I received no workers compensation, no disability, and no help from lawyers or doctors. I lived in my car for 20 years before making a fortune in Bitcoin. I showed someone love and I got hate, fraud and swindle in return. I haven’t had a date or a hug in 25 years.Stay away from me fraudsters, haters and swindlers. And corrupt governments and judges. Don’t tell me people are good. Most people are rotten. But you don’t have to believe me. Ask any Elephant or Rhino."
