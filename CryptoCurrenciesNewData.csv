https://preview.redd.it/rd53ciij1l141.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8bc95ffc3f44f3ac908547e8ff4e841b0b1b613

&#x200B;

14th of July, 2019 ‚Äî [Elrond](https://elrond.com/) ‚Äî the sharding-based public blockchain network is proud to announce a cooperation agreement with [Runtime Verification](https://runtimeverification.com/) for research and development in core areas of formal verification methods.

Elrond is using the [K Framework](https://runtimeverification.com/k/), developed by Grigore Rosu while at NASA and the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, as the backbone for all of its smart contract languages. Grigore has continued development of K Framework with his team at Runtime Verification which specializes in formal methods. Building on this, Elrond has developed an in-house GO backend to integrate the [IELE](https://github.com/runtimeverification/iele-semantics) VM, which is designed by the Runtime Verification team, and constructed entirely on the K Framework. Elrond is also working to integrate [KEVM ](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics)and [WASM ](https://github.com/kframework/wasm-semantics)in a similar fashion. Having the VMs built using the K Framework gives Elrond access to powerful formal verification tools.

The Elrond research and development team will work closely with Runtime Verification to further develop the K framework and its capability to generate correct-by-construction Virtual Machines for the blockchain. Through the research and development initiative between Elrond and Runtime Verification we aim to take smart contracts to the next level, and to make the GO backend developed by Elrond for the K framework, open source and available to the wide public.

Other Runtime Verification contributors or supporters include Ethereum, Algorand, IOHK, Casper, Maker DAO, Gnosis, Toyota and others.

 

>*‚ÄúWe at Runtime Verification are very excited to see Elrond‚Äôs commitment to not only use, but also contribute to the development of the basic infrastructure of the K Framework. Although ‚Äúformal verification‚Äù is now a buzzword in the blockchain community, in reality few blockchain companies genuinely understand the critical, almost desperate need of formal specification and verification of smart contracts. And even fewer understand that this starts with the formal modeling of the programming languages and virtual machines, and that formal analysis tools tend to be buggy, too, unless they are derived from such formal models. Elrond takes security at heart and follows the best known practices to assure safe and secure operation of their blockchain.‚Äù says* *Grigore Rosu, CEO of Runtime Verification.*  
*‚ÄúElrond brings a significant improvement to the blockchain space, setting new performance standards in terms of throughput and execution speed. In addition to performance, we believe dev tools and security measures like formal verification methods are instrumental for developers. Through the partnership with Runtime Verification we intend to raise the security standard by adding formal verification to our smart contracts, while integrating K framework to support several VMs and smart contract languages at the same time.‚Äù* *says Beniamin Mincu, CEO of Elrond.*

**About Elrond**  
Elrond is a new blockchain architecture, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 5-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.

Elrond is built by a team of experienced entrepreneurs along with 13 engineers and researchers with significant blockchain backgrounds and technical experience at Microsoft, Google, Intel, and NTT DATA. The team includes two PhDs in CS & AI, multiple math, CS, and AI Olympiad champions, and a former member of the NEM core team.",1575045029.0

93,A Novel Approach to adversarial behaviour through Robust Adaptivity (Elrond Network),1,e3aghk,CryptoCurrencies,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/e3aghk/a_novel_approach_to_adversarial_behaviour_through/,0,"Everyone‚Äôs intuition tells that the longer in advance an adversary knows about the proposer node and/or validator nodes ‚Äî starting from the node identity but maybe also their ‚Äònetwork coordinates‚Äô ‚Äî the more damage this adversary can inflict on the node (and, by extension, to the network). An even worse scenario is if, by knowing long in advance who is going to be responsible of a particular block proposal, the adversary can collude with the said proposer (or validator) so they propose (or validate) invalid blocks (e.g. allowing a double spend or minting coins out of thin air ‚Äî not unlike what central banks do today :-D). As a result it‚Äôs desirable to know a node‚Äôs role for a specific step (block) as little in advance as possible.

To resolve this conundrum elrond taken the following approach: we use the current block signature as a randomness source and based on that we pick a/ current proposer and b/ current validator set. One way this can be achieved is that everyone eligible runs a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) on the current block hash and comes up with a random number (and a proof that the random number was correctly generated by the chosen VRF).

The random numbers are arranged (say low to high) and the first one (producer of the smallest number) is the proposer, the next N are the validators. In this way, while the proposer can pick a particular block, they won‚Äôt be able to tell which of the other consensus participants will obtain a maybe smaller random number on the next step.

To make things even more difficult for byzantine nodes we‚Äôve also devised a process whereby from time to time (say each epoch) a part of the shard nodes are reassigned to different shards, without anyone in the network being able to tell in advance what node will be reassigned and, moreover, to which shard will it be moved. The reassignment process can be, again, the result of running a VRF.

The particularity we‚Äôve employed in designing our carrot-and-stick mechanisms is that besides rewards and slashing each node will have a rating that represents the view of the network on the said node‚Äôs behaviour. Playing by the rules will increase (up to a limit) the node‚Äôs rating, while adversarial behaviours will decrease it.",1575034914.0

As the new year begins, we‚Äôre taking some time to recalibrate our vision, refresh our roadmap, and set the stage for our next significant milestone.

## Making sense of the crypto winter

The promise of blockchain technology has brought tremendous excitement and euphoria, reaching a local peak in December 2017. Understandably, it is in our nature to get excited and overestimate the short term impact of technology. By contrast, 2018 was a year of correction, reckoning, and cleansing. By the end of the year, many supposed crypto funds were but one step from insolvency, with dozens of the once-promising crypto projects nearly bankrupt.

While nearly everyone got burned with the correction,‚Äùeasy money‚Äù has practically evaporated. The market has not only cleansed the landscape, but has also pushed back on the immediate visions of our future.

Still, it is precisely when most people lose hope, stumble and falter, that the greatest opportunities arise. The night is darkest before dawn. But the dawn is coming.

The first killer app for blockchain has been here for a while and that is money. Be it in the form of stable coins, tokens or many of the emerging decentralized finance tools, crypto‚Äôs core use case right now is value transfer and trading. The cryptocurrency markets represent the sum of centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, dark pools and over-the-counter trading. While the total value exchanging hands every day is in the tens of billions of dollars, only certain cryptocurrency pairs have significant volume, and even that is fragmented over a number of different exchanges.

[Orion Protocol](https://orionprotocol.io/) is a liquidity aggregator that connects centralized & decentralized exchanges to give cryptocurrency buyers & sellers access to more volume and tighter spreads. By deploying a set of smart contracts for managing liquidity and matching & executing orders directly between different chains, traders will have access to more liquidity than any single exchange and more cryptocurrency pairs which they can trade with less friction and costs.

Capitalizing on narrow timeframes of opportunity, quickly matching orders and executing trades in real time is critical for the success of Orion. In order to achieve its goals, Orion Protocol has chosen Elrond as infrastructure partner, to benefit from our top performing Virtual Machine and near-instant smart contract execution, as well as the high throughput and low costs that we natively provide. Elrond‚Äôs additional blockchain interoperability capabilities will contribute to Orion Protocol‚Äôs long-term success.

A good project, firm, institution, business or company is the one that has the interest of its customers, clients or community at heart as part of its good attributes. To practice a good customer or community care and relationship, a project must first have an up and working Support or Customer Service which is always available to respond when the Support Button is pressed.

DIVI is among the very few cryptocurrency projects with powerful and down to earth Support Service. This has been made possible because DIVI cares much about the Safety and Security of its community members. In view of this, DIVI has gone an extra mile to upgrade the already Support Service into the DIVI Crypto Concierge Program.

Real estate transactions before are often conducted offline that involves face-to-face engagements with various entities and there is no clear transparency and security. With the power of blockchain technology, it allows the democratization of real estate properties that open up the gates for potential investors from across the world to try their hand in [real-estate investment.](http://www.iatokens.com/)

Blockchain offers the ability to change how people invest in real estate. High value assets like real estate can be tokenized and traded via blockchain platforms. Smart contracts can complete sales and property records autonomously which is validated by blockchain and automatically executed when predetermined terms and conditions are met. It could be used to make a conditional offer to purchase a house wherein it will be programmed. If the conditions are not met, funds will be given back to the buyer almost instantly.

Blockchain technology disrupts the real estate industry with impactful power such as increasing the speed of transactions, bringing in more efficiency in terms of transparency, reducing the [heftiness of paper works](http://www.iatokens.com/) and others. These transparency and short processing time are what the buyers and sellers prefer and the main reason why they keep on engaging in this technology when acquiring or selling properties.

Real-estate transactions using blockchain could be smooth and easier as online shopping because it enables real estate contracts, escrows and property records to be completed and monies distributed without title companies or attorneys.

Currently, private investment has been flowing into real estate technology and are exploring its potentials on their business.

207,Elrond to Provide the Blockchain Component for the TailPath Supply Chain Management Ecosystem,1,e268hy,CryptoCurrencies,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/e268hy/elrond_to_provide_the_blockchain_component_for/,1,"Supply Chain is an encompassing term for the journey a product makes through manufacturing, shipping, storage, retail, acquisition, further storage and later use. The multiple entities involved in a product‚Äôs lifecycle and their actions are sometimes hard to track and account for, leading to uncertainty, additional expenses and even loss, theft or fraud. Supply Chain management products are created to address all of the above and more, helping to ensure authenticity, increase accountability, reduce losses and paperwork, and overall provide much needed transparency that helps build consumer trust and reduce costs for everyone involved.

Blockchain technology is the missing piece to the supply chain management software, providing a tamper-proof single source of truth for tracking the involvement of different companies along the path from manufacturing to consumption. To capitalize on this opportunity, SupplyBlockchain Inc was established in 2018 in the US. It since has a portfolio of customers in the transport, logistics and distribution industries, who substantially reduced their losses by using this innovative system.

Their flagship product [TailPath has already been successfully used in NATO military exercises](http://business-review.eu/tech/supplyblockchain-supplied-blockchain-software-for-natos-medical-exercise-vigourous-warrior-19-199816), making it one of the world‚Äôs first blockchain use cases deployed for military purposes.

Elrond‚Äôs blockchain infrastructure will be used to anchor supply chain data via the TailPath mobile app, with fast transaction times enabling real time reading and writing of data at negligible fees. Through a development grant offered by Elrond Inc, SupplyBlockchain will take possession of ERD tokens to cover the initial smart contract deployments and transaction fees for integration testing and customer acquisition.",1574837755.0

I am  a beginner in cryptocurrencies, I already used the Test Network of Ethereum to create a token. 

I am really passionate about the dev side and the useful side of cryptocurrencies.

My goal is not to invest into cryptos to win more money, I just want to have fun and use it for normal usage in small quantities. 

I think Bitcoin is not the best choice. I prefer a better crypto, but I don't know if Ethereum is the best choice. Or should I take altcoins like Ripple, Nano or Litecoin.

Can you help me?

St. JULIANS, MALTA and BUCHAREST ‚Äî 27 November, 2018 ‚Äî [Elrond Ltd,](https://elrond.com/)the technology company developing a new, scalable and more efficient blockchain platform, supporting negligible fees and a finality of just a few seconds, today announced a new agreement with one of the leading payment providers, [NETOPIA Payments](http://www.mobilpay.ro/public/en/).

NETOPIA is the biggest electronic payment processor in Romania, expecting to process in 2018 more than 13 million digital transactions with a total value of around $400 Million.

Elrond and NETOPIA aim to jointly explore the potential of integrating Elrond‚Äôs token, ERD, into the NETOPIA payment platform allowing their merchants to offer on their turn to their users and clients the possibility to acquire products and services through ERD tokens as well.

This will also mean that 6,000+ merchants who are using the NETOPIA solutions will be able to accept ERD cryptocurrency overnight, with no development or operational costs on their part.

Beniamin Mincu, CEO and Founder of Elrond, commented: ‚Äú*Elrond is focused on helping people enjoy greater freedom and peace of mind when they‚Äôre online and, especially when they are making payments. By working with NETOPIA and including ERD as a payment option, this new relationship will make it even easier for thousands of consumers to benefit from added security, and enjoy faster and easier payments.*‚Äù

‚Äú*Like Elrond, NETOPIA is a disruptive leader in its field and this agreement represents a fantastic opportunity for us to deliver added services to our merchants and their clients*‚Äù said Antonio Eram, CEO and Founder of NETOPIA. ‚Äú*It‚Äôs great to be working with an innovative partner that is committed to mutual success. We look forward to developing innovative new payments solutions with Elrond that benefit our clients and help NETOPIA‚Äôs continuous growth.*‚Äù

Elrond and NETOPIA are also expressing their interest in exploring other, but not limited, potential use cases, related to blockchain technologies, payments, and privacy.

Blockchain is a core enabler for the new distributed economy ‚Äî a layer of transparent and fair financial & technological mechanisms that will replace their centralized counterparts by offering the exact same functionality, but in a trustless manner.

Trusting a third party is replaced by mathematical proofs generated by the very fabric of any distributed layer ‚Äî its network of computers. Participating with computing resources in a blockchain is one of the many ways of earning money in the new distributed economy.

At Elrond, we strive to lower the barrier of entry for our validators so that basic computer skills and entry-level PCs are sufficient to join our network and earn ERD rewards. We however want to make sure that even Elrond supporters without the time or resources to set up their own nodes can put their favorite cryptocurrency to work for them.

We are therefore happy to announce that Everstake will run Elrond validators on behalf of anyone interested in their Staking-as-a-Service offering.

>*‚ÄúParticipants in the Elrond network are our core focus, regardless of their available resources or skills. By joining forces with Everstake we are now able to recommend a trustworthy professional blockchain infrastructure operator to all our supporters that need one.‚Äù said* ***Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO***  
*‚ÄúOur job as a staking service is larger than just validating transactions and generating blocks. We commit our resources to sustain the long-term well-being of the networks where we operate. Therefore, our selection process is rigorous. It includes due diligence on technology, economics, and business appliances. Elrond meets all our criteria, and we are happy to join the network as a validator.‚Äù* *said* ***Sergii Vasylchuk, CEO and Founder of Everstake****.*",1574649033.0

Contentos is a content public blockchain, capable of high TPS to support transactions generated by their DApp partners with 60M MAU efficiently. By providing a user-friendly open platform where content can be freely produced, authenticated of its copyrights, distributed, and transacted, Contentos aims to build an inclusive global decentralized intellectual property content ecosystem.

About Elrond
Elrond is a new blockchain architecture, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, elrond can process upwards of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 5-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.

We are excited to announce a new strategic partnership with Contentos, an innovative blockchain startup developing a decentralized media content ecosystem which directly rewards users for their contributions.

Live streaming is a major new force in the gaming industry, creating new links between developers and influencers and shifting our expectations of game play and game design, and is consequently a platform whose major structural effects are only now beginning to be understood. The combination of videos, livestream and blockchain technology makes Contentos a great partner to have especially in the context of our recent release of CryptoBubbles.io ‚Äî the first dApp to run on a state sharded architecture.",1574596763.0

**About Elrond**

Elrond is a new blockchain architecture, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 5-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.

We just moved from the Build Phase to the Challenge Phase. After they had us dig the trenches and switch to different shards, it‚Äôs time to prove just how much we can process. So far, we worked together as a team, and did over 1 billion transactions, sometimes even 30.000 per second, before the slowest of us fail and then we start again. Today we are at 1.000 TPS and holding, let‚Äôs see what they throw at us next.

As we get better at configuring the nodes and letting them do battle, there‚Äôs more time to read and do some work for missions. They made us send our favorite food as part of a transaction ‚Äî I missed you so much when I told the boys about your Orange Ginger Honey-Cakes.

Then they had us send transactions, with all the money that we earned or from all the different shards. I now understand which address is from where and why is that important and order of times faster. Elrond

Blockchain is a core enabler for the new distributed economy ‚Äî a layer of transparent and fair financial & technological mechanisms that will replace their centralized counterparts by offering the exact same functionality, but in a trustless manner.

Trusting a third party is replaced by mathematical proofs generated by the very fabric of any distributed layer ‚Äî its network of computers. Participating with computing resources in a blockchain is one of the many ways of earning money in the new distributed economy.

At Elrond, we strive to lower the barrier of entry for our validators so that basic computer skills and entry-level PCs are sufficient to join our network and earn ERD rewards. We however want to make sure that even Elrond supporters without the time or resources to set up their own nodes can put their favorite cryptocurrency to work for them.

We are therefore happy to announce that Everstake will run Elrond validators on behalf of anyone interested in their Staking-as-a-Service offering.

>*‚ÄúParticipants in the Elrond network are our core focus, regardless of their available resources or skills. By joining forces with Everstake we are now able to recommend a trustworthy professional blockchain infrastructure operator to all our supporters that need one.‚Äù said* ***Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO***  
*‚ÄúOur job as a staking service is larger than just validating transactions and generating blocks. We commit our resources to sustain the long-term well-being of the networks where we operate. Therefore, our selection process is rigorous. It includes due diligence on technology, economics, and business appliances. Elrond meets all our criteria, and we are happy to join the network as a validator.‚Äù* *said* ***Sergii Vasylchuk, CEO and Founder of Everstake****.*

503,Why do 51% attacks happen and what are they?,3,dzm7z7,CryptoCurrencies,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/dzm7z7/why_do_51_attacks_happen_and_what_are_they/,0,"Before we dive into this topic, one should understand the basics of Blockchain technology. A well-distributed blockchain consists of thousands of different nodes that individually support the network‚Äôs decentralization and security. These nodes are by itself supported by miners, basically computers who use their processing power to solve mathematical equations. All these nodes and mining computers are connected and together make up for a distributed datacenter we know as a blockchain. The way of reaching consensus about the given rules within the protocol varies per blockchain. The oldest and most commonly used version is the Proof-Of-Work blockchain, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Given the fact thousands of people and institutions around the world support these networks, it‚Äôs hard to breach the security. In theory, it is possible, however.

**What is a 51% attack?**  
A blockchain is hard to hack into, it‚Äôs not as simple to crack as a regular database that usually hides behind admin access gained with a couple passwords. In order to breach a blockchain, you‚Äôd have to perform a 51% attack. This simply means that you would have to gain access over more than 50% hashrate of the network, thus 51% attack. Hashrate is another word for mining power. The moment one sole entity is in charge of more than half of the network, this party can now change its consensus protocol. By doing so, you could reverse the blockchain years back in time causing many transactions to never have occurred, allow more Bitcoin to be created or destroy parts of the entire supply. This means you could cause chaos. The chances of a 51% attack are not that high, but in history, it has happened before.

***Ethereum Classic***  
One of the most famous 51% attacks was on the original Ethereum protocol, Ethereum Classic. After a major hack in the early days of the Ethereum network, the team we now know responsible for Ethereum took control of the network and reversed the attack. To frustration of the core team of Ethereum, that went on to build further on Ethereum Classic, the version that was never forked or whatsoever. Having a smaller market cap would make it less expensive for a single entity to take control of the network and that is what happened. $1.1 million in ETC was double spent during the attack, causing many major exchanges to halt the trading of the coin. Prices went down but eventually recovered and the hackers eventually got away with it.

***Verge***  
This project has suffered multiple attacks over the years. After claiming to be the number one privacy coin, the project called for many haters to come to their front doors. Back in 2018 however, Verge suffered from more than one attack. It started with a hacker found a way of integrating malicious software into the mining protocol. With their new version of the protocol, they could mine multiple blocks per minute on the verge blockchain, gaining them control over network hashrates and move XVG to their wallets. At the peak of the second attack, the hackers were mining 25 blocks per minute, or roughly 8250 XVG or $950 every single minute. Reports say over $1.7 million in XVG was stolen in the three attacks. The team behind Verge called it nothing but a DDoS attack. Afterward, a hard fork occurred and now a multi-algorithm style of mining is utilized to minimize the probability of another 51% attack.

**How can it happen?**  
You might be wondering, how is this possible? You plug in thousands of mining rigs and there you have it, you just gained control of the network. This, however, is a very expensive operation. Doing this for the Bitcoin blockchain would cost you around 1 Billion dollars, that amount much lower for smaller coins though. Ever heard of Monero? That‚Äôd cost you roughly $25,000 according to calculations by [Exaking](https://www.exaking.com/51). These are theoretical examples, in practice, many of these projects have built-in warning signs and detectors to go against these kinds of attacks. It is, however, important to be aware of this possibility. You can not just blindly trust any blockchain out there to be a hundred percent safe.

* Fibonacci 32 is used in many of the open benchmarks in the space, so we did the same. We wrote a simple contract in C, compiled it to WASM, deployed it in the protocol and called it via transactions. The results: **16ms average processing time**
* CPU calculate 8000 was tested as well. Compiled the same way as fibonacci 32. The resulting average processing time: **3.9ms**
* String concat 10000: concatenating a 44 character long string 10000 times took an average of **6.7ms**.
* Another test was running ERC20 contracts. Our test contained 100K ERC20 transfer transactions, running that batch several times. The average processing time for a transfer in an ERC20 contract is **0.29ms**. This means in a single block, where the block creation limit is of 1 second, the protocol is capable of putting **\~3350 ERC20 transactions** (including validation, processing and commit). In Elrond a round is of 4 seconds, the first second is left for the leader to create a block, the next 3 seconds are for propagation, validation, signing.

**How do we decide which VM is needed for a smart contract?**

In the Elrond protocol the address of any account is of 32 bytes, so there is a big room to play with these bytes and add some meaning to some of them. In case of smart contract we have the following convention for addresses:

* first 8 bytes are zero
* the next 2 bytes define the Virtual Machine Identifier on which the smart contract will run
* Bytes 11‚Äì30 are equal with sha256(smart\_contract\_owner\_address + nonce)\[11:30\]
* The last 2 bytes is the shard identifier

we (the team of STOcheck) are conducting a survey on what is holding people back to invest into Security Token Offerings (STOs).

The purpose of this survey is to better understand the market sentiment and what is yet missing in order for the Security Token Ecosystem to thrive. As many people within the crypto and Security Token sphere are on Telegram, we are doing the survey there. Long story short: If this interests you, feel free to vote what is holding you back to invest or potentially if you already did invest.

You will find the survey here: [https://t.me/STOcheck](https://t.me/STOcheck)

Obviously feel free to leave the group after voting. If you know people/groups/channels on Telegram that would be interested in this survey, you can aslo forward the poll so that we will generate a large rsample size.

Thanks!

604,Why Hyperinflation Occurs And How It Can Be Solved?,7,dyybtq,CryptoCurrencies,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/dyybtq/why_hyperinflation_occurs_and_how_it_can_be_solved/,27,"Within economics, hyperinflation is utilized to describe situations where the costs of assets and services increase uncontrollably over a specified period. In other terms, hyperinflation is extremely rapid inflation. Generally, inflation is termed hyperinflation when the rate of inflation grows at more than 50% a month. Hyperinflation usually occurs when there is a significant rise in the currency supply that is not supported by economic growth. Simply put, it is caused by dramatically increasing the amount of money in an economy. The increase in money supply is often caused by the government printing and infusing more money into the national economy. As there is more money in circulation, prices rise.  Hyperinflation instantly devalues the local currency in foreign exchange markets as the prices of goods and services rise in connection with the increase in the currency supply. Such a situation, in effect, often causes the holder of the local currency to minimize their holdings and switch to more stable foreign currencies. In an attempt to avoid paying for higher prices tomorrow due to hyperinflation, individuals typically begin hoarding durable goods such as equipment, machinery, jewelry, etc. In situations of prolonged hyperinflation, individuals will begin to hoard perishable goods.  On solving this kind of problem, the booming industry of cryptocurrency is being studied and utilized in other countries for the betterment of their economy. These are some of the reasons why cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular especially in countries that are dealing with hyperinflation, such as Venezuela. Similar occurrences can be seen in Zimbabwe, where digital currencies peer-to-peer payments have seen a dramatic rise.  It is interesting to note that as trust in traditional currency falls, faith in cryptocurrency tends to [rise](https://kucoinblog.com/cryptocurrencies-solution-for-hyperinflation-sk-rd). This might have powerful implications for the future of how money is viewed and dealt with globally.",1574261667.0

Hence we present Elrond, a novel architecture which goes beyond state-of-the-art by introducing a genuine State Sharding scheme for practical scalability, eliminating energy and computational waste while ensuring distributed fairness through a Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS) consensus mechanism.

Having a strong focus on security, Elrond‚Äôs network ensures mathematically verifiable resistance to known security problems like Sybil attack, Rogue-key attack, Nothing at Stake attack and others. In an ecosystem that strives for interconnectivity, our solution for smart contracts offers an EVM compliant engine to ensure interoperability by design.

ADAPTIVE STATE SHARDING

Comparable in throughput as to centralized counterparts.
Our architecture goes beyond state of the art and can be seen as an augmentation of the existing models, improving the performance while focusing to achieve a better nash equilibrium state between security, scalability and decentralization.

SECURE PROOF OF STAKE

Minimal energy and computational requirements.
Elrond eliminates the need for intensive PoW consensus algorithms and proposes a novel and more robust Secure Proof of Stake consensus, enhancing intra-shard communication and pruning the blockchain state to the most essential.

DECENTRALIZED

Increased security due to the randomly selected block proposer.
Elrond introduces an improvement which adds security and reduces latency, allowing each node in the shard to determine the members of the consensus group (block proposer and validators) at the beginning of a round. This is possible because the last block‚Äôs aggregated signature is used as the randomization factor.",1574079383.0

751,Elrond‚Äôs Design Rationale,0,dxgn8q,CryptoCurrencies,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/dxgn8q/elronds_design_rationale/,0,"Note: Throughout this article by proposer we‚Äôll refer to a node/entity in the network that is in charge at a specific time of proposing a new block, while validator(s) will designate the nodes/entities that are responsible with validating the block put forward by the proposer, thus effectively ‚Äúvouching‚Äù for the proposer.

The two problems that elrond tries to solve from the get-go are increase in throughput ‚Äî achievable through sharding and decrease in energy expenditure ‚Äî achievable through moving from a proof-of-work based consensus to a proof-of-stake consensus. Each of these two prongs require different aspects to be taken into consideration when designing the architecture and components around it.

The PoS aspect needs working around all (most?) common issues in PoS systems ‚Äî thus incentivising rational behavior. The sharding aspect needs mechanisms to reach agreements inside each smaller part of the network (shard) as well as agreement between participants in a transaction that spans more shards. And all these need to also take into consideration the potential Byzantine (adversarial) behavior.

Before anything let‚Äôs detail a common approach when talking about blockchains based on proof-of-stake: everybody tends to measure time with two units; the obvious one called block time (the interval between two successive blocks) but also a higher order one called epoch or era. From this point of view the interval required to generate a specific number (X) of blocks is an era (thus always era = X * block time).",1573985980.0

777,500 Million ERD tokens burned on the Binance Chain and minted on Ethereum as ERC-20 tokens,1,dx59ix,CryptoCurrencies,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/dx59ix/500_million_erd_tokens_burned_on_the_binance/,0," As part of our ongoing integration efforts into the [Samsung blockchain ecosystem](https://twitter.com/beniaminmincu/status/1191472313771802624) and in tandem with requirements from several exchanges, the ERD token needs to have an ERC-20 representation.

For compliance ahead of our mainnet launch, and thus ahead of the subsequent direct integration of our mainnet native token, we decided to burn 500.000.000 ERD tokens on the Binance Chain and mint the exact same amount on Ethereum.

Following these actions, the ERD token total supply stays unchanged, at 20 billion (20.000.000.000), and the ERD token circulating supply stays unchanged, at 8,084,166,667, representing 40.42% of the total supply.

In order to provide the necessary integration details to our ecosystem partners, the ERC-20 tokens have been minted early, with the following details:

**Token name**: ERD

**Token contract**: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xF9986D445ceD31882377b5D6a5F58EaEa72288c3](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF9986D445ceD31882377b5D6a5F58EaEa72288c3)

**Contract creation transaction**: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x75a78b14cef51547898368edc8704a5ecf77212a0368910a8177eb885e90f85e](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x75a78b14cef51547898368edc8704a5ecf77212a0368910a8177eb885e90f85e)

**Total ERC-20 supply:** 500.000.000 ERD

Following the respective integration plans and communication schedules, we are now at liberty to announce this change, together with the corresponding BEP-2 token burn, details below:

[https://explorer.binance.org/tx/14336AD54320CC25420D2A7C7AFB58A03A5252F6225D9D5B6AC96D57310AD0EC](https://explorer.binance.org/tx/14336AD54320CC25420D2A7C7AFB58A03A5252F6225D9D5B6AC96D57310AD0EC)

810,What is mining?,7,dwsstm,CryptoCurrencies,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/dwsstm/what_is_mining/,1,"*Mining is the activity of maintaining a distributed platform and creating new blocks with the ability to receive rewards in the form of new units and commission fees in various cryptocurrencies.*

A distributed platform is a way to solve problems at once on many devices combined in parallel. In the process of mining, a mathematical problem is solved, as a result of which you can get currency for it. In other words, PC performance converts into money, and miner pays just for electricity and the Internet.

Network support consists of confirming transactions by including them into blocks and calculating the key (hash) of such a block. The key of the block does not allow changing the information of the block in the future, which excludes the possibility of counterfeiting transactions made in the block. Finding (calculating) a key with the given parameters does not occur instantly ‚Äî it is necessary to generate many keys in order to get the given one. But this is not all ‚Äî after generating the key, you need to receive confirmation of the fidelity of such a block from other network participants. Confirmation consists of checking the block key. In the Bitcoin network, at least 120 confirmations must be received. Such confirmation is another degree of protection against distortion and additional verification of data on the network.

The essence of mining is the creation of a whole network of decentralized computers and the necessary equipment that solves all the necessary conceived using their technical capabilities. All these connections are called nodes in mining. And, the more of them are in the blockchain system, the more decentralized the network is, and all work happens much faster.

**Types of mining**  
From the technical side, mining can be divided into 3 types, depending on the equipment:

* GPU mining, i.e. mining on video cards.
* CPU mining, i.e. mining on the processor.
* Mining on ASICs (ASICs) ‚Äî special equipment created for the extraction of cryptocurrencies that work on certain algorithms.

Depending on the method, mining is divided into 3 types:

* Individual mining. This is an independent production with using personal equipment, without collective participation in pools. In this case, all the digital coins that you mined, as well as transaction fees, remain with you as a well-deserved profit. For individual mining, the power of the equipment is important, since a large hash rate is needed to ensure the complexity of the calculations. Solo mining is beneficial for mining relatively new cryptocurrencies.
* Common mining, it is mining in pools. A pool is a server that combines the computing power of many miners. It is a common computer network that creates new blocks. The coins mined at the same time are then divided among the miners according to their shared participation in the process. Pooling has become necessary due to the increasing complexity of the network of popular cryptocurrencies.
* Cloud mining. If the previous two methods use your own equipment in mining, then in cloud mining you rent computing power from a service that itself is mining on an industrial scale. In this case, you no longer need to start your own farms and maintain them. It is enough for you to pay for other people‚Äôs capacities and mine on the equipment of some industrial crypto-mine, as a result of getting mined coins. Cloud mining makes it possible to join mining without large investments.
* Web mining. One of the least popular methods of cryptocurrency mining. Web mining occurs through sites on which you need to register, install a special program and configure it. The owners of these sites use the power of all users who register on their resource for the extraction of crypto coins. In order to decide whether to work with the help of web mining, you must initially evaluate the size of all possible investments. All this is worth comparing with profit, and also take into account the fact that at the moment the extraction of cryptocurrency has become extremely complicated. Special sites, which are called ‚Äúcryptocurrency calculators‚Äù, do well with such calculations. The power of mining equipment is determined in mega hashes.

**Interesting facts**  
The terms of Bitcoins emission gave more advantages to those who took up mining with a small aggregate network capacity. So, the amount of work needed to generate the unit, in 2013 amounted to almost half a million times more than after releasing the network. With an increase in the total processing power of miners, generation becomes more energy- and hardware-intensive. This is accompanied by a planned reduction in the size of the mining reward. This way halving came in sight.

In the 2000s, fewer people knew about mining than now. Thas why, the benefit of mining was much more. But anyway there were some risks. F.e. on Reddit now you can find a lot of stories where miners got lost their keys and all the capital as well. But if there are all right with keys, the miner from 2010 has huge funds now.

**Mining today**  
Nowadays, it is quite difficult to start solo mining, because of the high competition of mining farms, pools and other entities. In addition, the start is expensive. In order to earn, you should initially invest quite a huge amount of money on expensive equipment and electricity. So you need to weigh the pros and cons before purchasing assets.

In early 2017, an independent team of mathematicians, quants and fund managers lead by **Igor Rivin**, Professor of Mathematics at Temple University and Whitehead prize winner 1998, and **Carlo Scevola**, economist and president of CS&P decided to design an index for the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.

The purpose of this index would be twofold:

**1.** It would be a kind of a barometer for the cryptocurrency market.

**2**. It would be an investment vehicle which would allow a passive investor to participate in the growth potential of the cryptocurrency space.

These goals meant that the index needed to be:

**A**. Diversified.

**B.** Have deep coverage of the cryptocurrency space.

**C.** Have as good a risk-adjusted performance profile as possible

They have decided to use top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization - the currencies below this cutoff are not very liquid and the top 30 capture 90% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. The constituents of the index are weighted proportionally to the square root of their market capitalizations.

The index is completely rebalanced every quarter, and reweighed every month. This is necessitated by the rapid evolution of the cryptocurrency market.

The index is called **CCi30**. From the beginning of 2015, the performance of the CCI30 index is up by around **7000%**. In the same period, Bitcoin, by contrast, is up some **2500%**.

The CCi30 is partnered with [**Libertypool**](http://libertypool.com/), a borderless crypto investment platform, to make the index available to invest for all the crypto investors.

You can start investing in CCi30 index by starting an account in [Libertypool.com](https://Libertypool.com).

Investing in the index allows to profit from the unforecastable raise of some cryptocurrencies, while limiting the losses deriving from the fall of others.

P.S. I help investors around the world to achieve financial independence through asset accumulation, especially with crypto asset investment.",1573853696.0

Please apologize if this isn't meant in this subreddit, however the subreddit of this fork is highly moderated and they remove any posts for people who ask about this! Even on their discord I've been banned for asking how to claim because they believe I am a whale and dump their fork bla bla bla.

So, one of my partners has a lot of old BTC private keys and asked me to help him claim forks.

However, there's a fork called BTC2 (Bitcoin 2), and several months ago they made a change which made it ""hard"" to see your balance. It actually happened overnight. I don't think there was any hard fork, I could still use the same wallet and they didn't provide a new wallet. I claimed from one private key a day before on their BTC2 core wallet, the next day all the other keys had a balance of 0. It's very strange, if you read their FAQ on their website, it says the balances haven't been removed (like with all other forks that did so) but they've been made ""hard to see or spend"". So if someone can help with claiming them, we would be happy to pay 1000 BTC2 or $1750 in BTC.

A virtual machine which deploys and executes smart contracts in a specific language is a high level plug-able component in this architecture.

One such VM has to satisfy an interface and gets read-only access to the data existing in the blockchain through a set of hooks. Through this interface the VM gets access to cryptographic and hash functions as well. A smart contract can interact with the blockchain through a well-defined API. All outputs generated by the SmartContract (e.g. balance change), is saved in a so-called VMOutput at the VM‚Äôs level. After the complete execution of the smart contract the VM output is returned to the protocol.

**Main highlights:**

* **Tech** ‚Äî [Technical development](https://github.com/elrondnetwork) is going very well. We‚Äôve implemented State sharding and Secure proof of stake. Several VM‚Äôs are integrated and we‚Äôve reached unprecedented results for smart contract transactions. We continue to push on this front, and are excited to be on track for launching mainnet targeted for December
* **Validators & dev ‚Äî** Number of validators have been growing steadily in preparation for the [Battle of Nodes](http://battleofnodes.com/) competition, first [economics proposal](https://medium.com/elrondnetwork/elrond-validator-economics-proposal-8679da7551ac) has been presented, and [staking calculator released](https://stakingelrond.com/) by the community. Several dev tools have been in the works, and will be released in the coming weeks
* **Biz** ‚Äî We secured 9 partnerships with relevant crypto projects, like[ Chainlink](https://medium.com/elrondnetwork/elrond-to-use-chainlink-a-decentralized-oracle-network-e8d633abe035?source=collection_home---4------10-----------------------) and[ Holochain](https://medium.com/elrondnetwork/elrond-initiates-cooperation-with-holo-a-scalable-agent-centric-distributed-computing-platform-913ced2299c3), and blockchain alliances, like[ IoT Alliance](https://medium.com/elrondnetwork/elrond-brings-its-high-throughput-and-fully-sharded-blockchain-infrastructure-to-the-trusted-iot-1a02a85efcdd) &[ Binance Chain Alliance](https://medium.com/elrondnetwork/elrond-joins-binance-chain-alliance-c4165db362d5). Additionally we have been working with a few large renowned enterprises on some substantial collaborations we intend to announce in the coming period
* **PR & Exposure** ‚Äî Elrond has increased presence at the top blockchain events, strengthened its reputation, and has been featured in top technical and crypto press outlets
* **Community** ‚Äî Elrond has seen significant growth on all relevant community channels, with tens of extremely passionate members going the extra mile, and supporting Elrond on all fronts ‚Äî big shoutout to them
* **dApp** ‚Äî The first dApp built on a sharded architecture called [CryptoBubbles.io](https://cryptobubbles.io/) has been very well received by the community. We had several gaming tournaments, and will continue to do others in preparation for the mainnet when the game will be played with real money

**General outlook:**  
The Elrond project has earned a strong reputation in the crypto community. We have launched several testnet versions, discovered hundreds of improvements, and have moved fast to implement them. Consistent effort put in by the entire team have helped us implement a state sharded proof of stake architecture that can process cross shard transactions, as well as smart contract transactions, something that has not been achieved before.

The multiple entities involved in a product‚Äôs lifecycle and their actions are sometimes hard to track and account for, leading to uncertainty, additional expenses and even loss, theft or fraud. Supply Chain management products are created to address all of the above and more, helping to ensure authenticity, increase accountability, reduce losses and paperwork, and overall provide much needed transparency that helps build consumer trust and reduce costs for everyone involved.

Blockchain technology is the missing piece to the supply chain management software, providing a tamper-proof single source of truth for tracking the involvement of different companies along the path from manufacturing to consumption. To capitalize on this opportunity, SupplyBlockchain Inc was established in 2018 in the US. It since has a portfolio of customers in the transport, logistics and distribution industries, who substantially reduced their losses by using this innovative system.

Their flagship product TailPath has already been successfully used in NATO military exercises, making it one of the world‚Äôs first blockchain use cases deployed for military purposes.

Elrond‚Äôs blockchain infrastructure will be used to anchor supply chain data via the TailPath mobile app, with fast transaction times enabling real time reading and writing of data at negligible fees. Through a development grant offered by Elrond Inc, SupplyBlockchain will take possession of ERD tokens to cover the initial smart contract deployments and transaction fees for integration testing and customer acquisition.

‚ÄúBlockchain technology is a perfect fit to address the inefficiencies of supply chains. We are pleased to support TailPath integrate their product with Elrond in a native manner, without adding unnecessary complexity via secondary tokens. This will keep the costs for their customers as low as possible while also providing a meaningful use for our ERD token and our overall infrastructure.‚Äù concluded Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO.",1573731058.0

It was launched back in the day through a newsletter for cryptographic experts and later on, the source code was shared online. The technology behind Bitcoin, plus nowadays any cryptocurrency out there, can not exist without the internet. A stable connection is necessary in order to keep the network alive. This strong affiliation with the internet has not only brought great scaling opportunities, it has, since then turned into a widely discussed topic. As loads of people like to do when discussing topics on the internet, crypto has been the source of many new memes out there. 

**When Moon? When Lambo?**

These are two commonly used phrases both referring to the price of the token. The phrase ‚ÄòTo the moon‚Äô came from prices suddenly spiking with hundreds of percentages causing people to draw rockets on the charts. These rockets should be leading them towards the moon, thus the phrase, when moon? It suits perfectly in combination with the phrase ‚ÄòWhen Lambo‚Äô, which was invented when the first crypto millionaires came around the corner. They started buying Lamborghinis with their earned wealth from investing in cryptocurrencies and people started seeing it as a means of measuring the success of a coin. 

**HODL**

This is a simple world that leads back all the way to 2013. Back then, market crashes were caused by as ‚Äòlittle‚Äô as one million dollars. Prices went up and down like a rollercoaster, just like we‚Äôve seen in 2017. With everyone that sells their tokens at the top of the charts, there are others who buy for these prices. The moment the prices drop, there are two options; You sell your tokens for a loss or you hold your tokens. A user on a Bitcoin forum posted a typo after a severe crash back in 2013 stating; ‚ÄúI AM HODLING‚Äù. This was then embraced by everyone in the industry and is now seen as one of the most used slang words in crypto.

**Doge**

This is the cutest of them all, doge. It‚Äôs the little dog that‚Äôs been visible in memes over the course of many, many years now. As a popular meme for years, some programmers decided to roll with it and create a ‚Äòfun‚Äô cryptocurrency. They took the Shiba Inu dog and took it as the symbol for their token. It has been steadily present in the industry for many years now, with a steady position in terms of market cap. But remember, 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE.

**Pink Wojak**

Anyone that knows their memes must have hard about the Wojak figure before. It‚Äôs that guy that‚Äôs incredibly frustrated with life, in this case, frustrated with crypto. It‚Äôs related to those who have invested in cryptocurrency heavily and foresee a crash coming in the near future. It was posted on 4Chan‚Äôs board /biz/ to display the despair caused by the price that had been dropping. Over the following months, many varieties of the Wojak-man were created. One thing they have in common; they are all pink.

**Altcoin season approaching**

We used to have just a couple of currencies out there, that has changed. Right now, there are over 3000 coins listed on CoinMarketCap but assumingly there are many more projects that label themselves as a cryptocurrency. With every new project, there are new investors that hope their project gets picked up and finds the eye of many potential investors. They want a new season to start, altseason. With every spike in Bitcoin, we see people screaming for altseason. There are tons of different memes out there created to display the people who sadly waiting for altseason to arrive. Whenever it does, we can see the ‚Äòwhen Lambos‚Äô coming up.

Memes are a good indicator of what‚Äôs trending in the industry. There are loads of people creating new memes every single day, but the moment you see the same meme every single day, there could be a trend starting. When everybody‚Äôs screaming for altseason, it might just be around the corner. Whether we‚Äôll all be on the moon, we‚Äôll drive a Lambo or we are stuck HODLING our coins, only time will tell.",1573701132.0

The ‚Äãstrategic alignment ‚Äãin this partnership is striking since both companies aim for mass adoption with similar BFT blockchain networks with low latency (sub 5 seconds) and both aspire to introduce interoperability of blockchain ecosystems. Most importantly‚Äã, both projects benefit‚Äã from this alliance mutually: Cere plans to introduce Elrond powered services and smart contracts such as ‚Äãpayment‚Äã, ‚Äãescrow‚Äã, identity services‚Äã as turn-key microservices for Cere‚Äôs enterprise customers.

As Elrond‚Äôs smart contract framework is acting as an interoperable settlement service with 100% compatibility with Ethereum VM and smart contracts, this can make native asset settlements across Cere, Elrond, and Ethereum networks not only possible but as accessible as a simple software service. Cere is also looking to leverage Elrond‚Äôs Adaptive State Sharding technology to accelerate Cere‚Äôs planned sharding & scaling implementation to further improve its network throughput.
