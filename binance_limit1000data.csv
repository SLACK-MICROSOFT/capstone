Am I the only one?,3,duyeh4,binance,https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/duyeh4/lost_of_google_auth_seed_the_saga_since_has_been/,11,"Here's exactly what happened. I switched android phones and lost my Google Auth seed for Binance. My bad, admittedly.

Now, as you may or may not know, there is an option to reset your 2FA on the condition that withdrawals aren't allowed for two weeks. Fine, couldn't care less.

So I start jumping through their hoops:

\- Agree I can't WD for 48 hours (fine)

\- Answer questions (and get them right) about my recent account activity, which cryptos are important, when I signed up, etc.

\- Showed them I actually KNOW my account password, and have access to my email. But they want to be more secure, fair enough I guess.

\- Proceed to upload a photo of my passport along with a picture of me holding up a sign saying binance and the date. I felt like I was verifying my account to submit nudes, except things ended up being much, much worse than that.

\- I thought the passport would be enough. I guess not. They then ask me to download the binance app and ask me to do their facial authentication by scanning the QR code provided on my account.

\- I do so and it doesn't work. I try again. And again. And again. Nothing is working and I'm becoming increasingly frustrated, so I contact chat ask them what's up and if there's some other method I can use. Nope, my only option is the facial authenticator.

\- The support person then proceeds to do the same thing every support person does who is at a complete loss (please uninstall and reinstall the app, please try with wifi, please try with mobile only, please try closing all of the apps). At one point, my exceptionally talented agent though the ""rocket"" in the tray (which was my reddit app, Boost) was the problem.

\- After getting absolutely no where I asked to speak to someone who could help me, maybe a manager or something. ""Sure"", they say. Then I'm transferred to someone else WHO LITERALLY DID NOT RESPOND TO MY QUESTION. And 15 minutes later, still has not.

At this point, I can only assume Binance is intent on keeping whatever assets are in my account for themselves. I know there is something there, but tbh I'm not sure how much since I haven't used them in quite some time, and most of my crypto is in local storage.

All I know is I am no longer able to get into my account, simply because I (stupidly) forgot to write the Google Auth seed down before I changed phones. Can anyone here offer any advice? Something that involves more than ""delete the app that has the rocket in the tray and try again"" lol.

Truly the worst customer experience I've ever had.. even worse than Comcast. Now I'm just pissed. I think I'll go drink.

EDIT: Problem eventually solved after a 4th rep as me to submit a video with identical info I'd already submitted in photos (with the assurance that this would get my 2FA reset). In summary, Binance isn't a scam, but there security has many issues that need to be solved. It seems every rep has a different understanding of what the process is. Good luck, Binance.

EDIT 2: Meant transfers are restricted for two days, not two weeks.",1573532879.0

So do you guys use some other exchange and get DAI or just keep USDt or some sort.

I'm hoping to expedite my application to enter into the Market Maker Competition.

First off, what does this mean:

The composite score will be calculated taking into account, among other factors:

* Maker volumes
* Bid/offer spread
* Total order size
* Order duration
* Market making time

My bot has an issue editing orders on the books, so my 'order duration' is less than a minute in each case. Are longer order durations worth more in the comp? or shorter?

Traded $1m CAD in 5 hours: Porting a Bot to Binance Futures Market Making Competition

Introduction

📷Yesterday, Binance announced a Market Maker Competition for their new Futures platform. Included in the competition is $0 Market Maker fees, and a prize pool of $hundreds thousands USDT.

My Plan

📷I ported Deribit's Python Example Market Maker to Binance Futures, using CCXT to connect the API.

Issues

📷I can't seem to edit my orders, so every bot run I cancel all the orders (by looping through open orders..) slowing down the bot considerably.

Findings

📷📷In total, in 5ish hours I traded over 80 BTC notional - almost $1m CAD. I lost about $90 USD in fees, and lost about $150 of my deposit.Note that I deposited $250 USD, and traded $1m CAD. That's about $3.37m USD per 24 hours, projected.Over the last 100 trades, since optimizing the params as best as my human mind can achieve, there's been a timespan of 10 minutes.In this 10 minutes, I've traded more than 1 BTC notional, made $0.613 realized gains and paid $1.285 in fees.

Tomorrow

When I'm accepted into the Market Maker program, and pay $0 market maker fees, my bot will achieve about 3.6% return on equity per hour. It will trade more than $3m USD notional per day. Moreover, my work Coindex will fund an account with more equity and we'll trade even more than that - and optimize the bot for the evolving market using our proprietary AI.

Next Steps

My work, Coindex, will plug in the input variables into their Neural Evolutionary AI in order to optimize this bot even further.

(**Disclaimer**: *The Author is the Chief Liquidity Officer at Coindex*)

I wrote these emails to the market maker contest email:

Hi Binance,

My account is under [jarettrsdunn1999@gmail.com](mailto:jarettrsdunn1999@gmail.com).

I've created a market making bot which is a variation of Deribit's sample Python Market Making Bot.

While my trades are good, and profitable, the maker fee is killing my balance slowly.

For reference, I've been building arbitrage and market making bots for a long time, see [https://github.com/dunncreativess](https://github.com/dunncreativess) , and have a Telegram room with 80+ members. One of them tipped me off to your futures Market Making competition.

Moreover, my current employer Coindex has a neural evolutionary AI that takes input variables and creates the most optimized results based on a set of competing genomes.

You can read more about that here: [https://hackernoon.com/coindex-labs-novel-search-applied-via-evolutionary-ai-creating-a-money-making-machine-n62j2gei](https://hackernoon.com/coindex-labs-novel-search-applied-via-evolutionary-ai-creating-a-money-making-machine-n62j2gei)

and here: [https://hackernoon.com/what-ive-learned-from-years-of-arbitrage-and-market-making-975w38rs](https://hackernoon.com/what-ive-learned-from-years-of-arbitrage-and-market-making-975w38rs)

Because Coindex's wallets would support this bot in production, we might not use the [jarettrsdunn1999@gmail.com](mailto:jarettrsdunn1999@gmail.com) Binance account to try for the competition prize.

We'd like to compete as we'd have the chance to win some exposure should we be able to replicate the successes we've had on BitMex, Deriibit, with Binance Futures.

We'd love to be involved..

cheers!

\----

Binance,

By my count, porting the bot to binance futures cost me about $150 USD and I've trade \~18 btc notional over the last 1k trades, with maybe 4k trades total - according to the exported doc about 80 btc notional traded - in the last 5ish hours.

I'd love to take part in the market making competition, mostly so I can save a penny here and there on market making fees - also so we can train the Coindex AI to optimize the input variables and maybe win your competition.",1573385372.0

Transferred $ to margin. 

Went to ""sell"" bch at a particular price and it gave me 0 as the amount when I hit %25. 

Strange because I had $ i thought. 
So I clicked ""borrow"" even though I should not have had to because I had balance. 

Price hit. Order hit. I assumed it would show up as a position with a live p and l display. No. Nothing like that. 

This is shit I thought. So I went to ""repay"" as there was no simple ""close"" option like on other exchanges. 

I had to manually put the amount in to buy and then repay with that which left a shitty amount of dust open due to fees. 

This system is piss poor. Any plans on fixing it?

Live display of p and l.

Binance is the first blockchain firm to join the council, Kakao announced Monday, adding that the other 24 members of the council include enterprises such as LG Electronics and UnionBank of the Philippines. Klaytn mainnet was launched in June.

Members of the council work as key decision-makers for Klaytn network’s business and technical developments such as running nodes, as well as work towards building Klaytn-based applications.

Kakao said, “more than a dozen” of its 47 partners to date, have already launched blockchain services based on Klaytn, and others are expected to launch later this year.

Ground X CEO Jason Han said the firm will further strengthen the governance council by inviting “leading companies in various industry domains” to join the Klaytn network and drive mainstream adoption of blockchain.

The Hawk Network project was incubated by Canada's UB.GROUP and Klaytn, a blockchain platform owned by Kakao Korea.

Then there was the next step where you need to download their application, it is for the phone only, and I do not use Google services, while the binance page with app download doesn't actually work on the phone, so I had to transfer the application for the phone through the computer, renaming the apk format and so on to avoid blocking. I really needed money for the plane by that time. and by that time it felt like the 7th circle of Dante's hell. now the application asks to look into the phone’s camera, while holding the phone vertically, and exactly in the frame and with perfect light, and so on, demanding to turn my head left and right, open my mouth, close it, close my eyes, and bullshit like that, I did it for 20 minutes, but the app is poorly done in everything that can be done poorly, it does not confirm whether the mouth was opened successfully or not lol, it just requires performing all these actions over and over again. I used many exchanges, survived a dozen ""hacks"", but this is the worst I've seen in a cryptocurrency market. it’s funny how binance clickbaited people with a decentralized exchange promises, and the first thing i got when googling about binance verifaction process was information about leaked documents from binance, that i'm now forced to send to get my money back

so my question is, how am I supposed to finish the ""open your mouth, blink, turn your head"" bullshit, if the programm is just asking to do it in an endless loop?",1571295203.0

I use ""deposit"" on the binance app, and it gives me an address. I deposit money using that address. Later on I use that address on bitref to check the balance. It shows that I did deposit that amount, but then it shows that same amount was withdrawn 20 minutes later. I check my binance account and it shows that I still have the balance available. 

I'm really not sure why this is the case, but it is. 

What I'm trying to do is simply be able to check my btc balance on a widget on my Android. It'd be nice if binance supported a widget that did exactly that, but I'm trying to use BTC balance widget which also shows I have a 0 balance in the address. 

Can someone help me out here and either explain what I'm doing wrong or help me with my widget problem? 
I would greatly appreciate it, thank you ahead of time.",1571228834.0

249,Binance are screwing over affiliates... again.,11,dhp7jx,binance,https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/dhp7jx/binance_are_screwing_over_affiliates_again/,35,"Binance are fucking over the people who have been sending people to their site since they opened. And yes I'm pissed about it. 

At last time I checked (a week or so), I have referred 6,319 people to binance. I used to get a very nice amount payout. Now obviously market bearishness is a little to blame here but this is what happened so far: 

When they opened Binance US. They do not allow cross affiliates. After this I saw a massive drop in my earnings and signup rate. I have messaged binance and they literally told me to stop ""stop bitching about policies I do not understand"" 

ok, so they never used those exact words, but that was the jist. They could easily have a system in place that facilities this, I mean many other larger companies do this.

###NOW.....

Whenever they send emails out, they actively promote new account signups with another affiliate ID: 

> All new users that register on Binance using this special referral link will enjoy a 10% trading fee discount. 

> LINK:

> https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=XXXXXXX

I have omitted the code as frankly I don't trust them to track people and fuck them over. 

Why is this bad? 

1) I can't be sure they are not giving out someone elses code and actively making money by allowing someone else to profit, that is scammy as fuck if so. 

2) This now makes people think oh, I will sign up with a new account and get better chances etc..... which means they leave their old account and the person who referred them suffers. 

Why would they do this? 

Frankly, because if they are paying out.. lets say 100 BTC in affiliate earnings per month and they can half that, they are saving a fuck ton of money. 

I have never jumped on the Binance is a scam or Binance is a cancer bandwagon that people often say here but I am starting to think that way.

1. You guys should put 2 competitive (in between) coins for voting. To be honest, VIDY is a shitcoin. I just saw the word ""ad"" in their presentation and instantly moved my focus on NKN. Im using an adblocker lol. I dont know what people were thinking about NKN but i guess this was the main reason why NKN has beaten VIDY with a destroying difference. Even searching for the words NKN and VIDY in Binance's official Telegram groups have given me enough results and convinced me to vote for NKN.
2. Open voting has pros and cons; Pros, Transparency is important. Especially for binance community. With this, people will now that voting was fair. Cons, people wont make research. Binance should be educational and enforce people to make research. Either way people will keep seeing crypto currencies just as money. If we couldn't see the votes, people would make their research and vote for the blockchain tech behind these projects. Maybe they would just discuss. Even that would educate people about the tech. Information grows by sharing.
3. Rewards for the winning projects were not encouraging enough to hodl BNB. It's obvious that there are many many people hodling loads of BNBs for ieos. I've seen and learned on Binance DEX trading competitions that if the airdrop is cool on the first day, it encourages people to trade and creates a demand. I was hodling 150+ BNB and what i got for 3 votes is barely 1 bnb. I'm not whinning but it was really below the expected.
4. Why there is no direct link to the voting page on Binance home page? If community voting will continue in the next months, it should has its own page just like launchpad.

ps, when next ieo?",1570866133.0

**If a hacker gets to login into my account and he has my 2FA, then he easily can add his own address or directly disable whitelist using the hacked 2FA**

Other exchanges have a lockup time period when you are adding a new address or disabling the whitelist, 24 or 48h without changes and they email you what is happening.

&#x200B;

I think On 2019-09-11 my google account was hacked and on 2019-09-17 all my coins from Binance were out.

&#x200B;

Interesting thing that Binance asked me or the guy to send a video of him and a ID in front of him to pass the verification and surprisingly Binance accepted his video.

&#x200B;

I asked them for recompensation of my coins for their nonprofesional behavior and failed person validation procedure.

&#x200B;

The first video Binance rejected but the second one the gave green light though is not me in the video.

&#x200B;

Binance answer was: NO coins back for you.

&#x200B;

Someone recognise the culprit?

Could you please check your withdrawal fee schedule for some cryptocurrencies.

For instance, Matic Network has a withdrawal fee of 100 Matic tokens. On its ATH that would be 4.1$ a withdraw. That's just absurd. Same goes for Ethereum which is more than 1.7$ while a transaction on the blockchain is 22 cents. That's +600% difference.

It's almost impossible for small businesses to operate with many transactions and withdrawals on Binance this way.

If so, can you confirm [this issue](https://np.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/d1ie63/critical_binance_u2f_auth_breaks_with_fw_215/).  Basically upgrading Trezor-T FW from 2.1.1 to 2.1.5 seems to break Binance U2F.  This only happens on Binance.  Coinbase U2F works fine both before and after the upgrade.

BTW, I'm referring to the U2F feature in Trezor FW that allows it to act like a Yubikey (sorta).",1568016632.0

Do I just send, say Harmony ONE or Fantom from Binance to my BNB receive address in Trust Wallet? I'd imagine this works the same as an ERC20 token, but I've never bought one of those, either! I'm a little surprised I can't find a step-by-step guide online for such a withdrawal ... I'm just nervous I'll go to withdrawal Fantom, for instance, to a BNB receive address only to find that address only works for the BNB token!

Any help is greatly appreciated.

I've also seen that there is are withdrawal fees and you should have some BNB in order to trade cheaper, my question is with all of these ""hoops"" and without being able to deposit in fiat where do I go from here? 

Do I buy Eth from Coinbase Pro, then pay network fees to get funds to Binance, then pay fees to buy my desired crypto (BTC), then pay to withdraw funds to a cold wallet and store for the long term.

I was initially attracted to Binance by the low fees in comparison to CB but now I'm a little unsure...

531,Where Altcoins are heading?,13,cpar1e,binance,https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/cpar1e/where_altcoins_are_heading/,21," Strange though this might sound, the most interesting path of progress unfolds specifically for altcoins. On the one hand, they do not have extreme popularity and a five-digit dollar price, but on the other hand, they have the motivation to create new promising models and occupy various industry niches, largely due to the technical capabilities of their projects. Since the technology itself is still at a development stage, and Bitcoin has already taken its position as a “digital gold” and an asset for long-term investments, several promising areas are still open for altcoins.

1. **Digital currency market**. The ability to succeed in the market is feasible through the fast transactions and the block size with the validity of its growth. This direction is available for those projects that plan their development several steps forward and work on their engagement with other cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and the fiat economy. 
2. **Existing business models**. Cryptoplatfoms that are designed to meet new solutions for various industries. Here we are talking about a wide range of things such as personal data, smart contracts, dapps, the Internet of things, sharing economy, various social networks, etc.

Altcoins’ potential will eventually influence its price. According to many predictions, shortly we are in for the next altcoin season. With BTC dominance breaking above 60%, it certainly seems like the times are coming for altcoins to enjoy new highs. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee agrees that the time of the altcoins could be almost upon us. Quoting crypto traveler ‘Heidi’, Lee concurred;

*“This ALT season reminds me of the early days of the 2017 bull. Some will pop, some will stay quiet until they don’t. However, I am now seeing a lot of small caps exploding higher.”*

Here are a few more arguments by experts in this field regarding the prospects of altcoin:

*“Bitcoin cranking up, but the real winners, beginning soon, pwill be the alt coins 10x + the rise in Bitcoin. Top of the heap will be the ones most beaten down in the Bear Market - Docademic, Apollo, XTZ, etc.”, John McAfee, British-American computer programmer, and businessman.*

*“I can say with confidence that the altcoin season will begin together with the adoption of technology, it is the technology that will determine the future liquidity of the market of altcoins and the general vector of market development. The future season of altcoins won't cover the whole list of altcoins, it will be related to the coins that present definite value for the industry”, Igor Chugunov, CEO at Credits*

*“If Altcoins finally reach its season, it will be astronomical and I see where coins like DENT, HOLO CHAIN, NPXS, VET and BTT can jump 70x within 2 weeks due to whales pumping and dumping manipulation. While BAT, ENJ, THETA, ZILLIQA, QUARKCHAIN, CREDITS, AUGUR, RAVENCOIN, MIOTA, BNB, etc. would multiple over 50x within 2 weeks”, Michael Shore, Chief Operating Officer at Mayax Corporation Inc.*",1565635913.0

For one year now, we see accumulating posts of people who cannot have their money because face verification fails.

Before even depositing anything to the wallet, I tried verifying my identity to get to level 2 and be able to use margin. I submitted my drivers license, photos, and so on. When asked to do face verification, I downloaded the app. It keeps telling me to nod the head, open and close mouth, etc, but it always fail with ""face verification failed"" or with some timeout message.

Also, before asking for the face verification, the website stated that it could be asked again on any time to confirm transactions. In other words, it could prevent me from accessing my money on any time, without reason, based on a broken face verification technology.

Binance, if you do not have the expertise to master face verification, then don't use it. I'm quite sure I am not the only person in the world facing this problem.

Knowing that the withdrawal limit is 2 BTC

So, in my understanding, if I have more than 2 BTC on my account ... I will be able to withdraw for example today 2 BTC, and then after 24 hours withdraw again the rest ? Is it Okey or Binance will lock account and require me to send documents ?

Twice now I've actually made it to the end of the webcam face verification and it says success. I shortly after get an email saying my verification failed because they can't read my documents. Funny, because it's the same documents I've uploaded to reset my 2FA.

1. Issue a token and allow them to stake it: How will that work? Will staking the token on binance chain contribute to binances blockchain directly, will it only affect the token built, or will it affect both?

Binance will distribute Komodo staking rewards as detailed below:

Starting from July 24, 2019, Binance will begin taking daily snapshots of user KMD balances at 00:00 AM UTC.

KMD Staking distribution will be calculated as follows:
KMD generated by each user = Total KMD staking rewards received by Binance * User KMD holdings ratio.
User KMD holdings ratio = User KMD holdings / Total KMD staked by Binance.

Users must hold at least 1 KMD in order to qualify for staking rewards.

The initial distribution of KMD staking rewards will be calculated up until September 1, 2019, with the total amount distributed equal to the staking rewards accrued on holdings during the period.

KMD rewards are calculated daily and distributed monthly. Distributions will be completed before the 5th of each month.

\- how many active users in 2019, in average? With active user I mean an account which has done at least one transaction.

\- What is the average transaction volume? (I guess I can calculate that with av . volumes and av. n. of transactions)

\- What is the average wallet size in Binance?

Not only that, but BNB is also my top held coin. I've been beyond impressed with CZ and the team pretty much from day 1, and am really hoping that he can come through with the opening of the binance.US exchange in time before the .com is illegal. BAM Trading Services got approval from FinCEN on June 11, so I am fairly confident that the US exchange will be live before the Sept deadline. 

&#x200B;

Getting the .US exchange up before the deadline is only step #1. Around 30% of [binance.com](https://binance.com) users are from the US, and I would guess many would gladly move to the .US exchange as long as it is open with enough time (2-3 weeks) ahead of deadline. The next question is will BNB immediately be available on the .US exchange / will it be deemed NOT a security? I believe that BNB is NOT a security. CZ has been proactive in making moves to lessen the gray area regarding this topic, with most recently announcing 100% of the teams allocated coins will be used for future coin burns. Here's another reason why I like BNBs odds: ZRX is not considered a security, and it essentially serves the same primary utility as BNB. Anyone creating an exchange using the ZRX protocol is required to charge their trading commissions in ZRX, similarly to how BNB is used for trading fees on binance. I've searched the web up and down and am just patiently waiting for the .US exchange to be announced as well as BNB being one of the coins available from day 1. Unlike many comments I've read, I am not worried that funds left on [binance.com](https://binance.com) will be frozen/unaccessible after Sept. No deposits or trading allowed, but withdrawing will still be possible. I am assuming some cautious traders/investors have already sold their BNB, and I've taken this recent dip as an opportunity to scoop up more coins. Yes, I have moved my long term BNB to a hard wallet, but even if BNB isnt available from the get go - Binance is a global platform with growing utility for BNB everyday. CZ is the #1 leader in the entire crypto space and he will not give up on the US. He is very well aware how important the US market is.

**50%** to ICO public (*are now some circulating on market and some hodling*)  
**40%** to Founding Team (*stay hodling Untouched*)  
**10%** to angel Investors  (*maybe  Untouched  hodling*)  


Also I read that binance will burn **20%** of profit, every quarter.   
Since it starts, **+-11** Milions BNB are burned.  
"" The current total supply of BNB is **189**,000,000 BNB""  


My question is,  if the goal of reducing **50%** of binance coin, 200MM to **100MM**.  
And CZ says that those **40% Fouding Team** stay untouched and out of circulation marketing.  
Was those **+-11** Milions BNB burned coming from our percent of ICO public **50% right**? that was in two years of burn, reduced in **6,24%**, just lefting to public **43,76% of the initial ICO public.?**  


That's mean that in +-14 years, binance will reach the goal to burn **50%** of total circulating supplie. 100MM.  
Then what will happen next? Angel investor 10% and 40%  Founding Team only will left.  
And until that time BNB will coast +1K USD, but only Angel investors and Founding team will have BNB holded.  


Wasn't CZ attitude to burn fast as possible this 40% is a strategie to save BNB in long term?",1563081229.0

751,"Quant Network in talks about Binance about connecting Binance Chain to Overledger - Allow 570 Banks, Enterprises with access to Binance Chain / Enterprise adoption as well as the ability to use Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin etc on Binance Chain - Blockchain Brad Video explains that and much more",26,c9jboj,binance,https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/c9jboj/quant_network_in_talks_about_binance_about/,5,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1b9TX6rcuI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1b9TX6rcuI)

&#x200B;

34:45 **We have been talking to Binance about adding Binance chain and connected Binance chain into Overledger means all the enterprises running permissioned blockchains can access Binance chain through Overledger for the first time, as you can't today there's no way to do it**. As well as everyone on Binance chain being able to talk to enterprises resulting in more customers for both parties, but also allows Binance chain to use Ripple, Ethereum, EOS etc through Overledger.

&#x200B;

Recommend you watch the entire video (is long but lots of information that explains the scale of this project). Overview of some of the main points below with time stamps so you can refer to the video. Blockchain Brad does really indepth Reviews on projects and doesn't get paid for them so definitely worth checking out his channel as well.

02:15 - Explains verticals Quant are targeting - Financial services, Government, Healthcare, manufacturing, supply chain, IOT

03:40 Bank client that went with hyperledger fabric 2 years ago and used Overledger to migrate to another blockchain

4:35 Working with 570 banks

5:15 - ""What ripple have been trying to do talk to each bank and sign them on 1 by 1, **IBM with stellar i've heard that hasn't gone to well lately so we are looking into it.** They are trying to sign on banks 1 by 1 and that's going to take a long time to do it

6:15 every bank has a payment gateway - does SWIFT, domestic payments, credit cards, international payments whatever the gateway does and SIA runs that infrastructure, secure and regulated by the Bank of Italy, complies to the highest level of security and I ran a similar environment in the UK on behalf of the Bank of England.

So all of these banks have all of these gateways, and on these gateways Sia has SIAChain which is there implementation of 3 blockchains, Corda, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum and so these blockchains already exist within that network and there are applications running on them today and what we are doing is these applications are limited because they are running on one blockchain and **we're bringing interopreability to it to create cross platform banking applications, core banking applications, this is rearchitecting the banking system that use Overledger and all the different blockchains, but more importantly to allow all these banking systems to connect and interoperate, so this is a big deal, your taking closed secure banking networks and allowing them to interoperate to create new multi chain applications to work across cross border networks**

10:26 **the clients we are working with banking is just the start, we're working with government, working in research in a huge conglomerate, these are going to use Overledger internally for their group which is all around the world**

10:54 we're allowing business interoperability, allowing trade corridors between countries and companies across borders which are not there today, and when you think about whats happening with digital assets and people are making their own tokens - J**P Morgan's coin is a great exmaple, i don't see why every other bank is not going to have their own token, so there could be a HSBC one, Santander etc, everyone is going to have their own banking internal token which is used for internal accounting purposes, moving assets. We are allowing banks to communicate openly with each other**

14:50 **Our vision is to be the foundation of the next financial system (DeFi) and we are reacrchitecting this and we are not just working with retail and commercial banks but also regulators and central banks, this is the level that we are working with.**

16:38 **570 banks they are going to use the technology at scale and we're not just having an application that does one thing, we're doing payments, clearing, settlement across different networks for all these banks**

18:07 **what we are doing with our architecture is automating and digitizing that across different blockchains and settling between different types of currencies, tokens, assets, value in real time and that's going to fundamentally change the financial system, this is a global financial change to the financial system we are not just doing bank to bank, we are re-architecting how finance works in the future**

19:20 **We ran the payment infrastructure for the bank of england and that's treated as the government as critical national infrastructure, thats the highest level of criticality because its so fundamental to the security of the country**. By having the experience and know what it takes to run a secure financial infrastrcuture and meeting the requirements of the regulators. First you meet the regulators, explain how it works

24:52 **And now we're expanding to the US where we have clients lining up that want to work with us over there**. We're going to build US Market specific products from the US, for the US market using Overledger, **we're looking at things beyond just banking and payments, we're looking at traditional exchanges, digital assets, asset management, and the same for Australia and other regions.**

27:27 we are really looking at ASIA, especially around singapore, hong kong and we are working with partners to go there, **just yesterday we had a meeting with a $8 billion company based in the ASIA region and they want to use Overledger for their clients and they are going to help us expand to that region, once we partner with the right bigger players**

34:45 **We have been talking to Binance about adding Binance chain and connected Binance chain into Overledger means all the enterprises running permissioned blockchains can access Binance chain through Overledger for the first time, as you can't today there's no way to do it**. As well as everyone on Binance chain being able to talk to enterprises resulting in more customers for both parties, but also allows Binance chain to use Ripple, Ethereum, EOS etc through Overledger.

49:08 **Oracle is one of our partners, they love what we are doing, they have looked at the technology and said interoperability is something all our customers are wanting and we are working together, we are part of the Oracle Startup ecosystem and there's more coming from that space, enterprises love the technology and its not just Oracle, but others that i can mention once allowed that want to take our technology at scale to their customers because it solves the biggest painpoints for enterprises and from a competition perspective rather than building they are partnering.**

50:04 **These are multinational global organisations with 100,000 + employees, this is the scale that we are working towards to take Overledger to the mass market. We can't do it one by one in each country and sign them up but we can partner with someone that has 100 customers and they can take it to all their customers as well which helps with the adoption of our technology**

53:25. Regarding exchanges we are under NDA with a few but we are focusing on Exhcanges which are good enough for the volume and the clients and the scale that we bring. **Just being transparent we are looking at traditional exchanges that also have the ability to look at Digital Assets and Quant Token is a digital asset, the market has changed since last year the big players have onboarded the ability to talk and transact digital assets on traditional exchanges that do stocks and bonds and derivatives and all traditional finance products. The market especially in Europe there's some regulatory stuff in the US that some are waiting to clear and thats fine but we're going to cater for all markets because what we bring is that Enterprise depth and volume because people need the QNT token and its explained in the Utility paper.**

54:58 You need the QNT token to access the ecosystem, you need it for transactions and volume and from a security perspective nothing will run unless you have the tokens and all transactions have to be signed and validated and encrypted using the keys and the QNT token for security purposes, so without it nothing will work

55:40 **Regarding when are we going to see the traditional exchanges - is it going to be sometime this year - yes absolutely, definitely sometime this year.**

1:06:25 **we have a couple of development houses that are using Overledger in telecoms for their customers and looking at royalties and building that on Overledger which is all multi chain. We've got some others in banking that are separate to the SIA banks and supply chain and yes there's lot of clients.**

1:08:30 People need to understand that patents are key to keeping the IP and the value of the technology you're building and like every other technology company like Apple, Microsoft or whatever they all have hundreds of patents to protect

Last week we had one which was published and that's taken around 2 years to get to that level and then we just add more patents to support that one and then we have to go different jurisdictions. It's very important to us because you're keeping the value of the technology and you're protecting the value of the technology and if someone tries to copy it we've got the patents that protect it and helps the company

1:11:30 **No we're not planning to exit, we're here for the long run, we see the potential, our customers see the potential we have a lot of investors talking to us who see the potential of what we are doing. we have the managing director of Rockefeller Capital Management on our board and there's other people at that level are going to join as well and so we're taking this as a long term thing and globally. We have had queries about that from a few in the last year and we have said no, not interested**

We all know by now, US customers will no longer be serviced. You will not be able to buy or trade on the [binance.com](https://binance.com) platform if you live in the US. But what does this mean? Once Binance US goes live, im certain they are doing this to comply with KYC and the USA/SEC. But what does that really mean? Once Binance US goes live, will the same coins be availble to trade and buy? Or will you be stuck holding bags of shitcoins that have really low volume once Binance turns off US customers for its standard site. This all is being swept under the rug.

&#x200B;

Binance's largest market share comes from the US. (from what ive gathered). Binance dominates with the most volume for USA customers, and they dominate in # of trades. Hell they dominate in a number of categories, but what im asking is, once Binance US goes live, will it be similar to coinbase where it has ""select"" few coins to comply and NOT be on the SECs radar? Most of you could get stuck holding shitcoin bags and the volume will tank. What are we doing? lol",1562209134.0

Futures - the perfect speculative weapon.

 Binance fully opens margin trading on July 11, and later launches cryptocurrency futures (as on BitMEX) with arm x20.
 And here it is impossible to overestimate the consequences.  The capitalization of BitMEX per day is $ 7 billion, and Binance - $ 2.8 billion.  Why so much less?  Because at BitMEX, trading comes with a leverage, and if we assume that everyone trades there with a maximum leverage (x100), then the real capitalization of BitMEX is only $ 70 million.  In fact, of course, the middle leverage on BitMEX is used from x2 to x5, but the principle is clear.
 $ 2.8 billion of real (without leverage) Binance capitalization will turn into $ 28 billion of daily (!) Capitalization if traders use the average x10 leverage.

 Binance will be the most important force on the crypto-box.

Lets say I have 100 Link coins on Binance. I wanted to do a test transfer to coin base and Binance has a minimum link withdrawal of 1.4 LINK. So, I withdrew 1.4 link to a verified coin base address. The withdrawal transaction showed completed in my binance history for an amount of 0.7 LINK!! (half of 1.4) BUT my account now shows I only own 98.6 LINKS. So I clearly lost 1.4 Links in the transaction but only 0.7 Links went to coin base??????

What is going on here????",1561859615.0

At first my payouts were not showing up it was just clocking, refershed a few times, closed the browser, came back and it finally showed them. When it came time to sweep my scrap referrals to dust it wouldn't let me hit the button to do so, was really confused and when I went to the new interface and checked I didn't have any dust so checked my wallet and sure enough it was there just never confirmedit sweeped.

I also noticed a lot of people having trouble withdrawing. I had already taken all my funds off but was able to send off $50 or so worth of referrals to another wallet.",1561847605.0

I was looking to buy some bitcoins, around 500 usd of investment but is there any posibility to deposit direct USD in binance account? At the moment I see the card payment and the price is very very huge compared to actual BTC price. For example, 1 BTC price now is 12,061.00 USD and if you want to pay with the credit card, the ""good guys"" from Simplex sell 1 BTC for 12,832.00. I mean there is almost 800 usd difference, this is kinda thief job. How is this possible? Maybe there are other ways to buy btc with credit card so I can buy it at a resonable price?

&#x200B;

We have created a Binance Chain bot that tracks various events happening on Binance Chain. 

\- Large Transactions of BNB and other tokens. BNB from 1mil USD, other tokens from 50k USD.  
\- Tokens that are listing on Binance DEX.  
\- BNB and other token burn events.  
\- New tokens that are migrating to Binance Chain mint events. Quite useful if an announcement by the project team or Binance is still to be made.
