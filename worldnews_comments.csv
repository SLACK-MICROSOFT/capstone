The question that remains now is *what are we going to do about it?*

The consensus among [scientists](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economists](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) on [carbon pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price)^§ to mitigate climate change is similar to [the consensus among climatologists](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) that human activity is responsible for global warming. Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets any regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/Is-the-Public-Willing-to-Pay-to-Help-Fix-Climate-Change-.aspx). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own. And [**a carbon tax accelerates the adoption of every other solution**](https://www.drawdown.org/frequently-asked-questions).

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)) not to mention [create jobs](https://econ.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/sites/econ.ucalgary.ca.manageprofile/files/unitis/publications/1-7729354/Yamazaki_CarbonTax_JEEM_2017.pdf) and [save lives](https://globalchange.mit.edu/news-media/jp-news-outreach/shift-renewable-electricity-win-win-statewide-level). 

Taxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf) (it [saves lives at home](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09499-x)) and [many nations have already started](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29687/9781464812927.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y), which [can have knock-on effects in other countries](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In poor countries, [taxing carbon is progressive even *before* considering smart revenue uses](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf), because only the ""rich"" can afford fossil fuels](s) in the first place. We [won’t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).
 
[It's the smart thing to do](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580), and the IPCC report made clear [pricing carbon is **necessary** if we want to meet our 1.5 ºC target](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf).

Contrary to [popular belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) the main barrier isn't lack of public support.

The best method I've read for sequestering carbon is growing switch grass, burning it, and burying the CO2 in the ground.  The carbon ends up in the ground and you can generate energy from the heat of burning.

To make a significant dent would require factories to be built, and land would need to be converted to switchgrass."

89,"Speak for yourself! I care. And I've made a personal choice to be the change that's needed in the world. 

* I've talked with friends and family about a [carbon tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price). I've convinced several that a carbon tax is a good idea. I've convinced a few to start volunteering for carbon taxes. [34% of Americans would be willing to volunteer for an organization to convince elected officials to act on climate change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). If you feel like you're up against a wall in your own political conversations, [here's some short trainings on how to have better political conversations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/how-to-have-better-political-conversations/). The IPCC has been clear that [carbon pricing is **necessary**](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf), and [talking about climate change has been scientifically shown to be effective at increasing policy support](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/30/14804). 

* It took a few tries, but I published [a Letter to the Editor](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/111) to the largest local paper in my area espousing the need for and benefits of a carbon tax. Maybe you don't read LTEs, but [Congress does](https://www.aclu.org/other/letters-editor-how-write-them-and-why-they-work). 

* I've joined several [organized call-in days](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/text/) asking Congress to take climate change seriously and pass Carbon Fee & Dividend. [These phone calls work](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf), but it will take [at least 100 of us per district](https://republicen.quorum.us/campaign/11713/) to pass a U.S. bill. 

* I wrote to [my favorite podcast](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) about carbon taxes asking them to talk about [the scientific](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economic](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) consensus on their show. When nothing happened, I asked some fellow listeners to write, too. Eventually [they released this episode](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/573) (and [this blog post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/economics-renewables-and-climate-change/)) lauding the benefits of carbon taxes.  

* I've written literally dozens of [letters to my Rep and Senators](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/write-your-representative/) over the last few years asking them to support Carbon Fee & Dividend. I've seen their responses change over the years, too, so I suspect it's working (in fairness, [I'm not the only one](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/accomplishments/), of course). [Over 90% of members of Congress are swayed by contact from constituents](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/citizen-centric-advocacy-2017). 

* I've hosted or co-hosted 4 letter-writing parties so that I could invite people I know to take [meaningful and effective action](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) on climate change.

* At my request, 5 businesses and 2 non-profits have signed [Influencer's Letters to Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/leaders/) calling for Carbon Fee & Dividend. 

* I recruited a friend to help me write a municipal Resolution for our municipality to publicly support Carbon Fee & Dividend. It took a lot of hard work recruiting volunteers from all over the city, sometimes meeting 2-3 times with the same Council member, but eventually it passed unanimously. [Over 100 municipalities have passed similar Resolutions in support of Carbon Fee & Dividend that call on Congress to pass the legislation](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/endorsements/municipal/). 

* I've [tabled](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/290) at several events, usually collecting letters from constituents to their members of Congress

* I started a Meetup in my area to help recruit and train more volunteers who are interested in making this dream a reality. The group now has hundreds of members. I've invited on several new co-leaders who are doing pretty much all the work at this point. 

* It may sound silly, but I invited *almost* all my Facebook friends to ""like"" (and by default, *follow*) CCL on Facebook. Research shows [55% of those who engage with a cause on social media also take additional action](https://www.nptechforgood.com/2013/04/22/12-must-know-stats-about-social-media-fundraising-and-cause-awareness/), and if even 1% of all the friends of everyone who joined just this year became active with CCL, we would have enough volunteers to pass a bill. 

* I gave two [presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/159) to groups of ~20 or so on Carbon Fee & Dividend and why it's a good idea that we should all be advocating for. I [arranged these presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/160) myself. 

* I co-hosted two screenings of [Season 2, Episode 7 of Years of Living Dangerously ""Safe Passage""](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/take-action/host-a-screening/#1485986882331-9e38cb79-9c5e1492-21fb7dd6-03b9bd85-3e3cce1f-2786706c-ee83)

* I attended two meetings in my Representatives' home office to discuss Carbon Fee & Dividend and try to get their support. 

* I've recruited hundreds of Redditors to [join me](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=CarbonTax)

96,no.  it won't.
97,A significant amount of the earth has been on fire lately. Pretty sure that increase has something to do with it.
98,"""The last time the planet had a concentration of 300 to 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere was during the mid-Pliocene, 3 million years ago — recently enough for the planet to be not radically different than it is today. Back then, temperatures were 2 degrees C to 3 degrees C (3.6 to 5.4°F) above pre-industrial temperatures (though more than 10 degrees C hotter in the Arctic), and sea levels were at least 15-25 meters higher. Forest grew in the Canadian north and grasslands abounded worldwide; the Sahara was probably covered in vegetation. Homo habilis (aka “handy man”), the first species in the Homo line and probably the first stone-tool users, got a taste of this climate as they arrived on the scene 2.8 million years ago. (Homo sapiens didn’t show up until 400,000 years ago at the earliest.)

To find a time when the planet’s air was consistently above 400 ppm you have to look much farther back to the warm part of the Miocene, some 16 million years ago, or the Early Oligocene, about 25 million years ago, when Earth was a very different place and its climate totally dissimilar from what we might expect today.""

There was *never* a chance you were going to vote for any progressive candidate, so you're not fooling anyone with your virtue signaling. However, for anyone else who has the misfortune of reading your temper tantrum, I'm going to correct one key assumption you made that is wrong.

**Consumer CO2 emissions are not the driving force of climate change. Industrial emissions are.** There *is* a non-negligible impact of people's car's and power usage that contributes to rising CO2 levels, but that is not the focus of green energy revitalization plans because they alone cannot stop climate change. It's the backbone industry for things like petroleum products, non-renewable electricity generation, beef, fertilizer, etc that produce the majority share of CO2. Leading these industries into more environmentally and economically stable directions is the only way to halt the progression of climate change."
107,"consider that you may have been brainwashed by the information sources that you read, view, and listen to."
108,"I know you’re just trolling, but I’ll bite.  As a former skeptic myself, learning about the history of carbon is what convinced me.  (Note: I’m still not convinced on a great solution, just that we have a considerable man-made problem on our hands.)

Back in the day, way before mankind, there was so much carbon in the air that humans could not have existed.  Earth’s air would have been totally toxic to us.  There was also no bacteria that was able to break down dead trees.  So as trees grew and grew, they trapped a bunch of carbon and cleaned up the air to our current enjoyable standards.  When the trees fell they just laid there with all the trapped carbon until they fossilized and eventually turned to oil which still has all of that carbon trapped inside.  (Hence, fossil fuels.)  Then we found these old oil deposits and proceeded to start releasing all of that carbon back into the atmosphere.  Oops!

So it’s not exactly like planting more trees will totally fix the problem on its own.  Those trees will eventually fall and be eaten up by today’s bacteria which will release their carbon back into the atmosphere while we keep burning oil and releasing those old gigantic stores of carbon.  It’s a band-aid.  Maybe it’d work if we could send all the dead trees out into space or something."

118,"You know what happens when stuff is more expensive? People buy less. Less products bought means companies seek ways to use less carbon, to lower their prices."
119,I largely agree with this. These energy commodities price all things therefore any benefit you get is limited to choking off the ones who can afford to consume least. The emissions problem is largely a problem of the affluent. It certainly won't produce any results by the time CO2 is no longer the main driver of climate change. At some point you can forget about tweaking your emissions because the planet itself will churning out more greenhouse gases than we are. The window of opportunity to act to delay (not avoid) is closing rapidly. We' re simply going to face the full wrath of the consequence of chemical kinetics before we ever agree to do anything meaningful. CO2 is too small a thing to focus on in the long run. It will soon be dwarfed in importance.

A carbon tax where people are paid to not clear tree's like what is happening now helps landholders and all you are ""doing"" is adding more of the same just with higher prices. You are promoting a scheme where companies are going to funnel money as a cost into tree planting at best and then will give these same companies a reason to raise prices and it won't change the pollution coming from these big companies at all, zero, zilch, nada so really all you are doing is spamming for these large companies.

281,If they're correct that would mean deaths in the tens of thousands
282,WHO tf said that?
283,So are continuously escalating headlines
284,This is like the opposite of ‘If my grandma had wheels she’d be a bicycle’.
285,Well not according to so far death rates... The who really messes up every bit of communication regarding the coronavirus...
286,"Terrorism has killed 21,000 people a year on average over the last decade. 

Here is a link to more terrorism stats. 

[Terrorism (Our world in data) ](https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism)"
287,"Is it for real? I mean, yeah it's crazy but really doubt that this is worse than terrorism. Just look home many lives it already took during those couple years, I doubt that this virus will get that bad."
288,"Another irresponsible article floating to the top of World News because its headline plays into the end of the world narrative that Reddiots love so much. The quote from the WHO representative was that a virus has potential to cause more economic, social and political upheaval than a terrorist attack. This has **nothing** to do with body count. Don’t get tricked by the fear inducing narrative."
289,Then why are Muslims being banned?
290,Terrorism is hardly a threat as is. It's a manufactured threat.
291,"TIL thx

In 1906, Alfred Henry Lewis stated, “There are only nine meals between mankind and anarchy. Ifthere were an interruption in the supply of food, fear would set in immediately. ... After only ninemissed meals, it's not unlikely that we'd panic and be prepared to commit a crime to acquire food.

Anarchy is a meal best served raw"
292,"Threat == potential, not current."
293,"Yeah, because the WHO was told by China not to make it a big deal."
294,"At a 1.8% mortality rate (excluding mild, unreported cases), Coronavirus would kill a lot more than that if the outbreak became a pandemic.

To eclipse terrorism, Coronavirus would only need to infect around a million people - around twenty times more than it has so far."
295,Do you mean American terrorism? I think you'll find the number is far higher than that.
296,Where does it say anything about body count? It literally just says Coronavirus is a bigger threat than terrorism. You can’t catch terrorism on the subway and then spread terrorism to children and old people around you. Of course an epidemic is more of a threat to mankind than radical people trying to instill fear in people for control and power over them. There are billions of people in China and the potential for mass loss of life is higher plus China is drastically misrepresenting the facts and covering up the true scale of the epidemic there. But go ahead and try and downplay it and write it off as liberal media fake news.
297,There is no ban against Muslims
298,Every time TSA treats me like a subhuman because I want to fly somewhere I remember terrorism has already accomplished the biggest threat it possibly could: Fear of my own government
299,"> After only ninemissed meals, it's not unlikely that we'd panic and be prepared to commit a crime to acquire food.

If things were going to shit around me to the point that food availability was a serious long-term concern, I'd absolutely consider robbing the local grocery stores for non-perishables.  

Cooperative behavior (i.e., *not* stealing and hoarding) keeps more people alive and is more efficient when things are going well, but if that cooperation has broken down to the point everyone's starting to starve anyway, the game changes and the non-cooperators will outlast those who keep trying to play when it's time to fight."

Even you managed to circle back to loss of life at the end of your thought.

And try to relax on putting words in people's mouths, you have no idea what my politics are.

340,"They're often exhausted and don't know all their options. Many are signing them without a lawyer. The lawyer quoted in the article points out that many of the NDAs probably aren't legally enforceable.

It's a settlement case involving one party who has more resources and is acting from a position of stability vs one who tends to have few resources and less stability. It's perfectly legitimate to discuss whether we think the more powerful party is strong-arming, even if it's not a sexual assault case.

Further, while the University is within their rights to do this, doing so rather than more aggressively investigating the case is likely to enable perpetrators and increase the risk of future assaults."
341,In civilized countries. So that doesn't include the US
342,"Fair point. But I’m missing a few points in the logic train.  No trial, so you aren’t guilty, but You paid, so most assume you did it.  What’s the logic in allowing an entity is fining someone over talking about a case?  It’s not a secret like the coke recipe. And you obviously admit fault, you paid.  How do the courts logic this?  Or is this simply another case of if you have enough money you can corrupt any court system?"
343,Don’t feed the troll.
344,So victims aren't adults who can enter into contracts?  Can a victim buy a car or sign a lease?
345,The way you talk about it is from a stance that an assault did happen.  The cases we're discussing here had insufficient evidence to prove anything.  They have no legal recourse and the University is making the best of a bad situation to protect all students involved.
346,This is the UK tho
347,">In civilized countries. So that doesn't include the US

If you're gonna shit talk the US at least look into it a bit.

>These and other rights, including family leave, rights against discrimination, or basic job security standards, were designed by the United States Congress and state legislatures to replace individual contract provisions. Statutory rights override even an express written term of a contract, usually unless the contract is more beneficial to an employee. Some federal statutes also envisage that state law rights can improve upon minimum rights."
348,"Part of the purpose of a settlement is that the case is considered resolved. You seek damages for something someone did, you settle rather than going to court, case over. The party in defense may have a problem if after this resolution you go on publicly discussing something they say never happened, and which they can no longer defend in court because the settlement is resolved.

Again, I don't agree with the majority of these NDAs being pushed, but that's the logic."
349,A settlement isn't admitting fault or guilt.   The school wants to protect all students involved and their own reputation.
350,"Sure they can. Just because a person makes a bad decision doesn't mean the organization isn't exploiting them. 

This is especially true talking about universities cuz you're dealing with very young people, who are inclined to see the university staff as figures of authority who they can trust. It is a disgusting betrayal of trust that universities don't protect their students from rape or seek justice after it happens. They do the opposite. 

Also, they're using an nda to suppress information about *violent crimes*. That's beyond evil. Fuck that nda."
351,If someone makes a rape allegation and there is insufficient evidence to prove the claim what more do you want them to do?  It seems like you're implying that anytime a rape allegation is made that a rape happened which is categorically untrue.

>is a multilateral agreement for cooperation in signals intelligence between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The alliance of intelligence operations is also known as the Five Eyes.[3][4][5][6][7] In classification markings this is abbreviated as FVEY, with the individual countries being abbreviated as AUS, CAN, NZL, GBR, and USA, respectively


https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data

>The phone, internet and email records of UK citizens not suspected of any wrongdoing have been analysed and stored by America's National Security Agency under a secret deal that was approved by British intelligence officials, according to documents from the whistleblower Edward Snowden.

>In the first explicit confirmation that UK citizens have been caught up in US mass surveillance programs, an NSA memo describes how in 2007 an agreement was reached that allowed the agency to ""unmask"" and hold on to personal data about Britons that had previously been off limits.


Read this too - https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/nsa-americans-personal-data-israel-documents

>The memorandum of understanding, which the Guardian is publishing in full, allows Israel to retain ""any files containing the identities of US persons"" for up to a year. The agreement requests only that the Israelis should consult the NSA's special liaison adviser when such data is found.

>Notably, a much stricter rule was set for US government communications found in the raw intelligence. The Israelis were required to ""destroy upon recognition"" any communication ""that is either to or from an official of the US government"". Such communications included those of ""officials of the executive branch (including the White House, cabinet departments, and independent agencies), the US House of Representatives and Senate (member and staff) and the US federal court system (including, but not limited to, the supreme court)""."
480,"people also don't realise the UK has the best intelligence services in the world and they know about all this and more. they still reccomended Huawei. America is not to be trusted either and the other main competitors, like America - Nokia - are less developed, more expensive, less tested tech"
481,"Well don't worry, China is trying their damnedest to build their empire. I'm sure you'll change your tune when you realize *they're still going to spy on you*, and the difference is that they will not care for you in the slightest."
482,"As you should, citizen."

A 2 minute check will turn up info on the CIA that would make you disgusted at any government, but Americans either dont bother to look, or assume that your average white bread american couldnt possibly be convinced to do blood curdling things. People break ranks and dissent constantly. You apparently just ignore that and act like it soesnt happen."

486,And it was later shown that Germany was spying on the US.  The BND worked with the CIA to do things like this.  It is just the nature of spy agencies.

They will be left with pieces of disjointed territory. They will not be allowed an airport or a sea port. 

They will not be allowed an army to defend themselves.

All access between areas will be controlled by Israel. All trade will be controlled by Israel. 

All the fertile Jordan Valley area and waters will be given to Israel. 

The Palestinians capital will be the Abu Dis area on the outskirts of Jerusalem. This area is currently a waste disposal site for Israeli Settlements.

Trump plan has given two barren desert areas bordering Sinai to the Palestinians and said look we gave you extra land.

There is a map showing how the Palestinians areas would look like if they surrounded by water. It shows the reality of this Bantustan. Even Apartheid South Africa didn't try this shit.

Under the plan, the Palestinians will have less control and power than most US towns, even building permits will be controlled by the Israelis.

528,"The Palestinians had agreed to the the Saudi peace plan and the Oslo plan.   The Israelis agreed to Oslo and then used the loopholes in the plan to seize water, build settler colonies and avoid any equitable settlement.  

The Israelis were never interested in peace with Palestine but in pieces of  Palestine."
529,"Then propose a counter offer. ""These are the things we require to come to the table"". Negotiate, stop wasting money on weapons and terrorist salaries and allow the Palestinian people to prosper. Build schools, mosques, hospitals. FFS Palestinians get billions in humanitarian aid money every year, where is this money going?!?"
530,"The Oslo plan guaranteed Israeli security, which never happened in the first place."
531,Palestinians were offered 97% of the land they asked for in 2008 under Olmert but refused again without a counter offer. Now Abbas wants a time machine to go back to then. A time machine is not a counter offer. Where is the counter offer?
532,"This headline is absurd. He never threatened to rip up anything, only that he agreed that the extradition treaty is ""unbalanced"" and is something to look into.

And this was during a PMQ. He didn't hold a press conference to announce that he was gonna tear up the treaty. He was taking questions as scheduled, and one mentioned extradition. 

Corbyn basically asked (paraphrasing) ""isn't it messed up that the US aren't sending Ann Sacoolas back here to face justice""

To which BoJo responded with (paraphrasing) ""Yeah for sure. Extradition treaty seems unbalanced, def worth looking into""

And that was it. 

So before people start dancing in the street and rain gildings down everywhere, this is much less of an ""Oh wow"" type of story and more of a ""huh"" story"

Tbh it should be looked into, and doesn’t matter that she is a CIA officer, she should not have been driving. The extradition treaty should be honored for both sides. If the USA won’t honor it then it would be in the best interest to end it and renegotiate or not at all.

541,Interesting that extradition treaties are not just a sore thorn in authoritarian countries.
542,"Well, he's not wrong that it's unbalanced, but he didn't say he's going to do anything about it, and likely has no intention to. A PM standing up to the US is basically unheard of. We've been their poodle for a long time. Why? We can't afford NOT to be any more. Most of the world thinks we suck, we're net consumers reliant on imports, and half the country still carries on like we're a global empire. It's even less likely a PM will stand up to the US now Brexit has happened, because we need all the friends we can get, and they're not going to be easy to find."
543,"Lol no he wont, BOJO is Trumps fuckboi. He will bitch and moan in front of the cameras then apologize to orange dada and offer the NHS up as an apology."

554,"The blonds aren’t getting along, folks."
555,"the wife was a spy, that's why they won't and shouldn't extradite. You never ever send a spy back if they're in in trouble with the authorities, even to a friendly country. What happened is shitty but I agree with US govt stance in this case. The most basic promise that governments make to their spies is that they will back them if their cover is blown. If the US govt extradited this woman back to the country she was spying in to face prosecution, none of our spies could trust the US at all, the backlash would be enormous.

And she probably wasn't spying on the UK. You don't share your nukes with a country you don't trust. She was likely there to spy on other foreigners"
556,Ya he can threaten all kinds of shit but let’s see what happens. A lot of blather from this clown.
557,Why can't Boris use a hair comb for once?
558,"The UK regularly delays extraditing people to the US -- or they just outright refuse. The US has never previously refused an extradition request.

""Based on the numbers provided to Sir Scott Baker's panel, under this treaty, 130 extradition REQUESTS were submitted from the US to the UK. Of those 130 requests, the UK has refused 10. Of the remaining 120, 77 individuals were extradited from the UK to the US; the other 43 cases remained pending in the UK system, or the individuals returned to the US on their own, or other circumstances made the extradition no longer necessary. During the same time period, **the UK submitted 54 extradition REQUESTS to the US, of which none have been refused**. Of those 54 requests, 38 resulted in extradition of an individual from the US to the UK. In the remaining 16 cases, the individuals either returned to the UK on their own or other circumstances made extradition from the US to the UK no longer necessary.""

The US has extradited 38 US persons from the US to the UK. There have been 77 people extradited from the UK to the US, ""the US has a population about five times the size of the UK, but there have been fewer than twice the number of people extradited to the US than to the UK. The number of US requests is therefore not disproportionate."""

That having been said, ~~Borris~~ Boris can fuck right off. He got his wish to pull out of the EU, and now he needs all the friends he can get as he starts to negotiate partnerships around the world. Tearing up treaties with the US is not going to benefit anyone, and it sure as shit won't make Trump suddenly spawn a conscience and do the right thing.

I feel for the family of the kid that was killed, but nothing ~~Borris~~ Boris is doing is going to help to resolve that situation. I would hope that the British people see this for the shortsighted political posturing that it is.

Edit: spelling the asshat's name correctly this time."
592,"Maybe he should. It does sound like a bad deal for the UK.

But, under the current treaty, the UK extended her diplomatic immunity.

Sure, I think she should go back. But, legally, no one can force her."

607,Especially funny since the truth is the exact opposite.  This is the first time that the US ever refused to extradite to UK and clearly the UK has no right to demand that immunity be waved.  The U.K. regularly refuses extradition to the US (about 10% of cases) on dubious grounds.
608,"Aghhh, I just those damn clickbait headlines... Thanks for explaining everything!"
609,Also the fact that it's never ever ever going to happen. Diplomatic immunity is just that and no country is going to mess with it. No country.

615,Potential wave of negative karma?  That’s like saying you will risk a wave of negative karma for saying something bad about trump.  This sub overwhelmingly hates that lady
616,"> Anne Sacoolas is someone I would like to see in prison or 6 feet under, what she did was criminal and disgusting.

That attitude is probably part of the reason the US is refusing to extradite her back.  She didn't kill a person on purpose, it was an accident, yet people think she should be put to death.  She should get a fair trial, but that's going to be difficult now."
617,What exactly did she do? I must be missing something.

620,"Destabilise the EU, cause the US to pull back from their world-police role so they can make moves in eastern Europe?"
621,"> Now things are getting more interesting.

It's really not. Boris didn't threaten to rip anything up. He was asked a question about Sacoolas and more broadly if the extradition treaty is fair, considering the US is helping Sacoolas. 

He responded by saying he agrees that the extradition treaty seems unbalanced and is worth looking into. 

But that doesn't translate to ""threatens to rip up treaty"", nor does it even mean he'll meaningfully pursue any action on the current extradition treaty. 

Especially now that UK has officially begun its year long Brexiting and needs to negotiate trade deals with the US, and in light of the BOE's newest forecasts and reports that paint a unfavorable and dim outlook for growth."
622,Putin is laughing hysterically. He didn't do anything.
623,Putin?
624,"Well, it's not going to be Crimea - you can cross that off. How's *""the lamentation of the women""* looking? I see a lot of that here - but what's it like on the streets?"
625,This is the long game.  There is global political chaos and the balance of power is currently shifting soRussia continues to increase its position of power.  If this is a game of cards Putin doesnt have many chips but he knows that the players at the table with the highest stacks have absolutely no idea how to play poker and every time they go after eachother he stands to gain.
626,"Yeah everything involves Putin 

You conspiracy theorists are fucking mental"
627,"Honestly more competition is good for the world as a whole. Speaking as an American it’s certainly bad from the US’s perspective but from a global perspective it will generate better ideas and be a more fierce filter for poor ones. Who knows, this may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. Forcing European countries to innovate more in sectors traditionally dominated by US companies means that Russia and China will find it harder to place their products as well. They can no longer be the nimble dark horse to the US if everyone is doing the same."

This is what happens when the insane get into power.

Edit: I'm not praising Trump here. Merely commenting that suggesting any kind of cahoots between these 2 men is a failure to understand at least one of them. If Trump wants a trade deal with the UK then he's going to expect us to accept a ton of concessions."

636,"Yep.  If the tables were turned and this was a member of the UK intelligence services, they wouldn't extradite her to the US either."

As I understand it, the area is known for errors by Americans driving on the wrong side of the road.  I know that sounds like I am placing blame on the victim, but it does suggest that more caution, especially on a motorbike, should be taken. As well as, the local authorities need to take more action, such as providing larger shoulders."
674,Nobody is accusing her of murder.
675,"Also American, also agree."
676,"She was driving on the wrong side of the road and hit a young lad on (I think) a moped, killing him. 

Truth be told, if she had stayed in the UK and faced up to what she had done, she actually probably wouldn't have had any jail time (or she would have had to do VERY little). As far as I'm aware, it's her first ever offence, and it was clearly accidental. 

But she would probably be treated much more harshly now, since she fled and lied to police about whether or not she was going to leave the country. 

Someone can correct me of I'm wrong, but I think if she visits any other countries that have an extradition agreement with the UK, we can have her extradited from there. So I don't think she'll be allowed to visit many countries for the rest of her life. 

Could be mistaken though."

Not really, [as you can see from the timeline](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/22/harry-dunn-death-timeline-key-events-anne-sacoolas).

Second, Ms. Roberts Giuffre stated in court filings, under oath, that Prince Andrew had sex with Epstein and another 8 girls who all appeared to be under the age of 18. But, you, the valiant pedophile defender, are quick to point out that age of consent varies by jurisdiction, ignoring the fact that these were children, not able to even vote, that were being sex trafficked for his filthy pleasure. Who would have ever imagined that pedophiles would know how best to take their disgusting, shameful behavior to jurisdictions that allow sex with minors.

747," Donald Trump Jr. corresponded with WikiLeaks ,  starting in September 2016.  WikiLeaks sent him messages through July 2017. 

U.S. intelligence officials believe with ""high confidence"" that there  is a connection between Russian military intelligence and the entities  Guccifer 2.0, DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks that resulted in the deluge of  hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary  Clinton's associates hitting the Internet in the weeks ahead of the  election.  

 The January 2017 intelligence report confirmed Russian intelligence  ""gained access"" to DNC networks in July 2015, keeping it until at least  June 2016. 

Days later, then-candidate Donald Trump joked he hoped Russia would ""find"" Clinton's missing 30,000 emails, causing an uproar from critics. 

 ""I love WikiLeaks,"" Mr. Trump said on Oct. 10, 2016.

In  October and November of 2016, WikiLeaks proceeded to publish emails  from former Clinton aide John Podesta, and intelligence officials also  blamed Russia ultimately for the breach.

And then there are his attempts to help Bradley Manning log in to classified systems  under a different user name as something that journalists are “ethically  required to do: take steps to help their sources maintain their  anonymity.”

Yet no journalist is ethically required (or even permitted) to try to  hack a password to allow his source to continue his illegal work  undetected. The active participation in the hacking itself makes the  alleged “journalist” a part of the hacking scheme. This isn’t just  receiving a stolen document; it’s actively assisting in the theft.



He’s not a member of the media. He’s nothing like a responsible  journalist. And he’s not a true publisher. Instead, in the words of CIA  director Mike Pompeo, he’s the leader of a “non-state hostile intelligence service.” He’s a tool of Russia that is aimed directly at Russia’s chief geopolitical rival."

As far as I'm aware, she had to actually claim diplomatic immunity. So she did actively leave. Though I'm not going to claim I know exactly how the whole process works. 

The real crime here is thay the US did not waive diplomatic immunity. The convention states that those with diplomatic immunity are expected to still obey the law of the land, and since killing (whether accidental or otherwise) another person on the road is illegal in both the US and UK, one would have thought that diplomatic immunity would have been waived.

The fact that diplomatic immunity wasn't waived becomes even more shocking when you know that a Georgian diplomat in America had his immunity waived (after the US asked) for killing a young girl in a drunken crash in 1997."
756,"> She did not intentionally drive on the wrong side of the road, it is how they drive in the US, which she had just left 3 weeks prior.

Thus, it is perfectly acceptable for someone who says ""I hate the French"" to be considered racist, despite the fact that 'french' is not a 'race'.

In common parlance, it is normal useful and practical to refer to someone who is xenophobic as racist.

Thus

876,"I'm waay out from an expert; just someone who got salty about right-wing reactionaries trying to pretend they had the 'scientific highground' with their race realism and decided to actually do some reading after high-school.

Essentially one of the major issues we've found in science in the last hundred years or so (and indeed this issue was discussed by Plato) is that our tendency to group things by characteristics (phylogeny by quality) falls apart when you zoom in.This issue comes up everywhere, from race theory, to gender theory, even to evolution and specieation (a similarly out-dated model).

The proof by contradiction is effective in my mind; if it *were* the case that their is such a thing as a 'biological race'; then we should be able to find a way to dilineate those races using biological science - there must exist a biological marker by which we can exclusively group people into races.

Contemporary science has failed to find such markers, and has shown that all previously considered markers are not necessary for those races, and not unique to those races; meaning they are not racial determinants.

this shows up in the gender debate as well; similarly, if there *were* two genders, we would expect to find characteristics that were exclusive to one gender, and never part of another gender.   

These things *seemed* to be the case with out less advanced sciences, but modern gene sequencing (among others) again fails to find a true delineation criteria, and shows that previous criteria (like XX or XY) are not exclusive to either gender."

Correct; saying that there are neatly defined races is exactly what that shows is *not* the case; and since we can categorically *not* draw a conclusion of someones race based on biological criteria, then *necessarily*, any conclusions drawn from the argument '\[this race\] is like this because \[biology\]' is necessarily, fundamentally, flawed.

What baffles me, is that Islam seems to be held to different standards, than let’s say Christianity, when it comes to making fun of bible bashers it’s all fair game, but if anyone makes jokes about Islam, people (inc. white liberals) go nuts! 
What’s even more surprising, is the general Islamic attitudes towards LGBT, women, etc are at best archaic and at worst out right hostile! (Not that other religions are much better), and yet despite this, people defend Islam to death. 
I’m not saying it’s right to be an edgelord and insult individual people’s faiths and character, but this double standard about making fun of the religion is absurd.

Edit: I should point out that I was born and raised in Egypt before moving to the US.  While I am not religious my family is Christian and part of why I came to the US was to escape religious persecution.  The fact that it's come to France now where you can't say something negative about Islam without fearing for your life is deeply troubling.  This is why people like me left places like Egypt.

That sentiment hasn't changed much over recent times. People consider a prominent figure burning a Quran controversial, the same would be done to the bible and literally no one would give a shit.

These people are only following what they have been taught and they firmly believe that they are doing something good. I however, would argue that they are a shitty person.

But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.""](https://imgur.com/gallery/aLfAq)

1039,Watch the death camp of tolerance South Park episode. It's great satire and one of my favorites.
1040,"This is also known as the paradox of tolerance.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox\_of\_tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance)

It pretty much sums up the reaction this girl is getting.

Intolerance has been tolerated to the point that the tolerant will no longer do anything against the intolerance, leading this shit show."
1041,"Yeah, fuck that. Religious extremism is one of the biggest problems facing mankind."
1042,Austria convicted someone of blasphemy recently.
1043,Victimless crime.
1044,"> a crime by your government

Seems like in this instance, and others in France, that the Muslim populace likes to take the law into their own hands."
1045,Have these people tried assimilating to french culture?
1046,"Democracy is rule of the majority. When Muslims become the majority in all democratic western countries, we will live in a theocracy."
1047,"And this is one of the fundamental issues with theocracy.

A government by definition governs ALL the people in a specific territory.
A religion's rules, on the other hand, only apply to followers of that religion.

As soon as you're applying religious rules in government you've fucked up because now you're oppressing people who don't follow that religion.

I don't know why but Islam seems to work its way into governments more than other religions. I wish muslims would stop doing that; you can believe whatever you want personally, just don't use government to force others who aren't of your faith into your rules."
1048,"> If it's considered a crime by your government, you live in a theocracy

Not always.

I'm in Indonesia and we famously had a Christian president impeached and imprisoned for blasphemy against the Qu'ran. It kinda backfired though because most Muslims disagreed with the ruling and I know some who even renounced their faith. A lot of Muslim groups spoke up against it calling it blatant corruption and misuse of power by the guy who took the presidency after Ahok's imprisonment.

Ahok is generally seen here as one of the best recent presidents and most Muslims would have preferred that he was able to continue his term. 

Either way Indonesia is definitely not a theocracy since although about 80% of people here are Muslim there are also a lot of Catholics, Hindus and Confucianists as well. In our last election there were men and women from all religions campaigning for the presidency."
1049,Wonder how this would have went down in Britain
1050,Islam has no shortage of insecure people.

1073,Islam is the religion of conquest. The Quran teaches on almost every page to kill and destroy non believers or apostates. They say it’s a religion of peace. Not even close. The greater and lesser jihads are respectively described as a war within yourself and the war with others (most notably non believers). Islamists tend to flip it around. I guess we can kinda thank Christianity and the crusades for keeping Islam in check.

1087,"Muslims are becoming more secular. Just ask most people from Muslim-majority countries.

1095,"You make a great point here especially pointing out the double standards / pass that Muslims get from society. Muslims get a pass when they say homophobic remarks, rape, and beat people. But when a highschool girl says online that Islam is a religion of hate she gets so many death threats she fears for her life. 

Also, I 100% agree with you when you said that we shouldn't be bringing in people who persecute others based on religion and have no respect for our Western values (that's why your fam left Egypt for US)"

They totally ignore this and welcome remarried people to their churches even in leadership.  They are total hypocrites and it is cultural and not religious hatred that they are displaying."
1116,"
Since witches are burned at the stake, they must be made of wood, since it burns as well. Wood floats on water, as do ducks. Therefore, if the woman weighs the same as a duck, she must be able to float on water, which means she is made of wood, and consequently must be a witch."
1117,"No one suggested that she was racist. The person you're responding to said she did not resort to racial/ethnic slurs but merely criticized the religion, which is not racist at all. It *would* have been racist if race or ethnicity was brought up. The comment was praising her sensibility and wording. 

Generally racism and religion aren't necessarily related but places like say US, islam is used as a scapegoat to be racist against brown people."
1118,"I mean he doesn't claim she's anything other than a teenager that got into the spotlight, but at the very least she's not calling for hate as the assholes sending her death threats make her to be."

1124,"Hi. There is no god. That is why the world hasn't ""imploded.""  The point is that people responding to criticism with violence entails that they imagine their god as a bitch.

1209,"This is all my opinion and nothing else, but religion was absolutely necessary once people started to live together in larger groups and as a simplified version of the timeless questions - where did we come from, why are we here, what happens when we die?

First things first - society. I imagine when people started transitioning from tribes and forming villages and towns, there had to be a way of assuring safety and benefit for all. If you put an all seeing, all knowing entity in the sky that can punish you for all eternity, it takes away the incentive to steal whatever and kill everyone. Like yeah, you may fuck my wife and steal my cow, but the old man in the sky is gonna get ya ten fold later.

At the same time, it offered comfort in knowing what happens when we die, when our loved ones die and that we'll all be together again. It answered the ""where did we come from"", because if you don't take it too literally, the big bang is explained for the common man of the time. Imagine going back a few thousands of years and you'd start going off about how time didn't exist, relativity, formation of matter, atoms, quarks, etc.... people don't understand this stuff today and we have videos, animations, explanations. It also gave people purpose - do good, so you'll be rewarded later. It is something to live for. Look at people now, when we are realising our existence is random, there is no higher purpose, other than the one we create for ourselves. Some can, some can't. That's why depression is at an all time high.

I am not religions myself. Totally opposite. Regardless, I see what religion did for us and how important it was for our development. Is it skewed now? Only when organised. At it's core, it's not evil or corrupt.

1210,"The way I see it religion is just a means to control people and consolidate power.  You control their “thinking” by laying out some ground rules you want them to follow ( 10 commandments), and make sure everyone who doesn’t follow is met with harsh faith (see what I did there?). You play into two of the most influential emotions, fear and anger to stay in power. Fear of the unknown (death/future) to make them fall in line, and use anger (mostly for “outsiders”) to move your following."
1211,">  what religion was before it was bastardized.

Pretty much Life and Law. 

Imagine you believing in something so hard it's basically impossible for you to imagine a world without it. Even now, religious believers know that they're making the **choice to believe**. Back then, God existing was like needing to eat. 

People actually paid the Church to have their sins removed. The Church had complete, absolute control over the people. If the Priest said A, then A it was. 

It was worse than indoctrination."
1212,"My issue with the thought that all religions are bad is that there are hundreds if not thousands of religions. A lot of them are actually really chill and peaceful.

Islam isn’t all that bad at all if you read the Quran, but then you have Wahhabism and sailfism (basically the whole Arab world) and it just twists it.

For instance, did you know that homosexuality comes up once in the Quran? And it says that a prophet told the people of Lot that what they were doing was wrong.

That’s it.

Never says kill them or anything.

And I bet you think that muslims can’t drink huh? In the Quran it says “it brings more sin than good”

That’s it. Not “YOU’RE GOING TO BURN IN HELL AHHHHHHHHH”

PEOPLE do this.

But because of the actions of CULTURES, we expect there to be a lot of violence in it.

Hell, even Christianity and Judaism says a lot of fucked up shit about gays, but Islam surprisingly doesn’t.

ITS PEOPLE!

Then we have people on the other side who are just as naive and they say “religion is a virus”

Nope! You’re just as uneducated about the topic as the guy twisting it.

1216,"I won't speak for the guy above, but I'll give you my experience. I am an ex-Muslim partly because of 9/11. After the 9/11 attacks my family and other muslim friends were saying almost the same things as the guy who is often quoted in this thread and article (Abdallah Zekri). Things like America deserved it or had it coming. I would not characterize any of my family as extremist or fundamentalist, but most could not see 9/11 for the evil act on humanity it was. So no for the most part I don't think ""moderates"" often disavow the acts of extremist in my experience."

The problem is, every other religion has managed to mostly reform itself and modernise with time - some would argue too slow, others would argue too quickly. Islam hasn’t. Islam is still operating like a religion of the Middle Ages, and attempts to modernise it from within have been almost wholly unsuccessful, and often met with the standard threats and violence.

It provides an artificial sense of community and unity to rally around, an easy way to justify the existing social order, and a convenient and simple method for dehumanizing those you wish to conquer. 

So, yeah, people are at the core of the problem; the human condition. Take our species out of the equation and maybe somewhere out there is a benign and peaceful species perfectly capable of peaceful and benign religion. Maybe someday that will be us.

Hadith, and the opinions of scholars of the various schools of Islamic jurisprudence, have always formed part of orthdox Islam.

(There is also a case to be made that the violence of Antifa is reactive, whereas violence from the alt-right can be seen as proactive, but that's a bit more nebulous.) A 2017 study by The Nation Institute and Center for Investigative Reporting found that between 2008 and 2016, there were:

>115 Far right inspired terror incidents. 29% resulted in fatalities. These terror incidents caused 79 deaths.

>63 Islamist inspired terror incidents. 13% resulted in fatalities. These terror incidents caused 90 deaths.

>19 incidents inspired by left-wing ideologies and eco-terrorism). 10% resulted in fatalities. These terror incidents caused 7 deaths.

It's also silly that far right and islamist terror are often categorized as two different categories... They're both far right ideologies.  So, I really don't understand why people like to downplay that link as well.

There will always be bad seeds. There will always be yin and yang. There will always be the mentally ill within the healthy. However, to ignore the larger scale in how much it happens within a specific group of supporters and their leaders is ignorant.  It's a problem within the institution; the leaders know it benefits them as leaders (psychopaths, most likely) and then you have other people that condone it with verbiage like

Some of these fundamentalists even think that the Vatican is too modern (!) to their tastes and do not recognize the Pope as head of their church."

>Depending on my mood, I sometimes but not always refrain from pointing out what a breathtakingly insulting and patronizing question this is. (It is on a par with the equally subtle inquiry: Since you don't believe in our god, what stops you from stealing and lying and raping and killing to your heart's content?) Just as the answer to the latter question is: self-respect and the desire for the respect of others—while in the meantime it is precisely those who think they have divine permission who are truly capable of any atrocity—so the answer to the first question falls into two parts. A life that partakes even a little of friendship, love, irony, humor, parenthood, literature, and music, and the chance to take part in battles for the liberation of others cannot be called 'meaningless' except if the person living it is also an existentialist and elects to call it so. It could be that all existence is a pointless joke, but it is not in fact possible to live one's everyday life as if this were so. Whereas if one sought to define meaninglessness and futility, the idea that a human life should be expended in the guilty, fearful, self-obsessed propitiation of supernatural nonentities… but there, there.

I don't believe in any religion, but you don't talk to someone by insulting them.

1338,"I once saw it hypothesised that the lack of inherent protection in the US for any specific religion made the religious groups far more dogmatic and power-grasping than elsewhere. For example, in the UK the Church of England had guaranteed power and protections (still has unfortunately) but perhaps that led to it becoming lazy and not having to fight to maintain that or energize voters. Hence we are now a country where the vast majority don't really give a crap about religion anymore, certainly not to the extent that anyone is particularly concerned about the CofE influencing government (although I would like to see the guaranteed seats in the Lords for bishops removed).

1347,"Saudi Arabia and Iran are interesting because they seem to me to be polar opposites.  Both totalitarian, yes, but coming at it from different angles.

In Saudi Arabia, there is a hugely conservative and Islamist society that is very set in its ways.  The governance (not government) of the country comes from two different authorities - the monarchy and its thousands of princes on one hand and the Wahhabi religious authorities on the other.  These two institutions coexist peacefully.  Meanwhile, you have a large portion of the community identifying as Salafists, an even more conservative branch of Islam.  The monarchy is attempting to slowly secularize, but they receive push back from both the Wahhabi religious leaders and society at large.  Meaning, the monarchy WANTS to be less religious, but the people really aren't allowing it.

Meanwhile, in the metropolitan areas of Iran, there is a large portion of people who are secular and would like to live more like a European than adhere to the strict rules imposed on them by the government.  A majority of Iran is religious, but mainly in the countryside - places like Tehran are secular and modern.  So you have kind of the opposite happening from Saudi Arabia.  The religious authorities get their powers from the hinterlands and force that religion on the people of the metropole.  So overall, the religious people of Iran are getting their way with the leadership, but the traditional bases of power are more powerless."

Maybe ""magician battle"" was a bit harsh. I'll give you that, but the tales told by most religions are farcical recollections, bred of a time when reality was MUCH different than it is today. That being said, in many cases the faith as it was presented at the time was likely much more attractive than the current reality in which those faithful lived. The same can be true in 2020, but the perversion of those faiths has become exactly the thing that they were created to ward against.

Don’t know enough people living in Iran to confidently say either or, but based on the few Persian people I know they’ve explained it isn’t as simple as that. IIRC it’s more of “the people in power are abusing their power” and less “we disaprove of the strict rules and want to live like the west.” They just dislike the lack of freedom they’re allowed in that regard (think how a lot of super religious Christians in the west would love the US to be a Christian country but would immediately hate it when their hypocritical actions gets them punished)"

Well there's you're problem right there. You've placed the extremist minority on the same level as the overwhelming majority of normal people. Religious zealots *are* the same as flat-earthers and climate change deniers: they are extremists of their view who are unwilling to listen to other points of view, and may even get angry when they are contradicted. *Any* belief will spawn extremists. Religious, non-religious, scientific, philosophical, anything. 

But religion as a whole is incredibly valuable. At it's most fundamental level, it is no more than a tool to make people happy. It gives people hope, it can (and I use this word very cautiously) save people, it can make them happy and give meaning to their life. Billions of people find profound value and meaning in their faith. This is not detrimental, this is wonderful, even if it does not have value to you. 

If you consider religion as a whole to be detrimental to humanity, I would urge you to consider what value religion may have, both to humanity and to the individuals who constitute it."

Why put people off listening to you when theres eons of evidence of the earths existance that you can draw on to help you.

Now I think that is a perfectly valid belief to hold. But if you express that belief by attacking or belittling others for their beliefs are you any different from the Evangelical Christian yelling slurs at a gay couple? 

Something that you believe is causing you to attack somebody with a differing belief and you are refusing to respect that belief. Whether you belief in religion or not your actions are the same as those of a religious zealot based on something you believe and I'd argue they are just as detrimental to humanity. 

Ultimately I think what people believe has no effect on anyone but themselves, it's what they do with that belief that is a problem. Regardless of whether you are Christian or Muslim or Atheist, if you use those beliefs as an excuse to attack, belittle, disrespect, or control others, now you are having a negative effect on humanity."

Technically, its original context was the practice of asceticism (denying your body for spiritual gain), but really it applies to any situation you can think of. It applies to religious devotion as well. If you're calling atheists/religious people idiots or murderers or aliens or whatever, you are an extremist (though you may not be militant).

If you refuse to engage in meaningful discussion with someone who has a different opinion than you, on the grounds that they have a different opinion, or if you cannot do so without also considering their view, then your opinions are not needed. This is as true for people who think atheists are murderers as it is for people who think religious people are delusional idiots. 

If someone religious is making you feel bad or insulting you for being an atheist, they're an asshole and you don't need to talk to them. If someone atheistic is making you feel bad or insulting you for being religious, they're an asshole and you don't need to talk to them.

>I don't see how there is a 'jealous ex' problem. I feel rather that the UK did not anticipate to be treated like any other country that is outside of the EU. That was an argument against brexit btw.

The UK is aiming to be treated like any other country, the EU wants to treat it like any other country for access, but like an EU member for regulatory control, because the EU (sensibly..) doesn't want a major economy on its doorstep, outside of its regulatory orbit. The issue for the EU isn't that the UK wants an overly close relationship, or more access than the EU wants to give, its that the EU seems to think that it can keep the UK in a much closer relationship than it wants, without the access.. 

>Now people realise that being a tiny country in global terms also means you have little bargaining power.

The UK isn't a tiny country by any measure, and the problem here isn't that the EU is about to impose something on the UK, it isn't. The issue here is that the EU is about to end up not able to use the leverage it has because the UK walks away."

Either the EU is open to the UK and can limit its ability to compete (maybe, assuming the UK agrees to that approach) by pulling it into its regulatory orbit in exchange, or it can try to limit the UK's access. But in the latter, it then loses the ability to retain the UK in its regulatory orbit.

The EU is trying to do both, that simply won't fly (it'll end up with the UK outside of its regulatory orbit and no preferential access in either direction).

The EU isn't managing to use its weight to secure anything in this context, it is going to end up wasting the significant leverage it has by not getting an agreement."

The UK is a big market, not as large as the US, China or the EU, but still pretty damn big, it's bigger than the majority of the markets that the EU has trade deals with.

The EU obviously has to do what's right for the EU, my point is more that the current approach isn't going to get them there as it'll result in them wasting what leverage they have and getting nothing at the other end of it.

So I think in the end the result will be a no deal, or the UK concedes that it has to abide by EU standards and regulations in exchange for a certain degree of free access for its companies to the EU market.

1437,"The current approach is the same that we had for the last three years, the UK representatives consider they are entitled to all benefits and none of the responsabilities of being a member state, they use the EU as scapegoat for the baboon cage is their parliament and their mismanagement of their whole country for the last 20 years, the EU says no to all of their pretensions, they get a no deal.

The UK keeps pushing ludicruous and delusional deals, the EU keeps saying, no, and that is the end.

The UK will learn the hard way this lesson, they had made their own bed and are responsible for everything is happening, the EU is obligated to nothing.

Keep in mind that this will be every single trade deal that the UK bargains for from now on they are not part of the EU, they will always get the bad end of the stick when bargaining with other superpotences, as they do not need the UK but the UK needs them, hence the lack of bargaining power."
1438,"> No, if the UK doesn't like the deal it'll just say no.

Oh, well that's OK then. Never mind the disasterous consequences!

You act as if it's the EU that has everything to lose from no-deal!"
1439,">I think you have to look at Norway and Switzerland as comparison. The regulatory power you talk about is naturally being accepted also by them. Without certain regulatory alignment it is impossible to do trade.

Neither are comparable in size to the UK though, not by any stretch, and I don't think the EU wants to replicate what it has with Switzerland (And the UK doesn't want a slew of interdependent agreements either).

>But the EU can make the rules of course, and just expect the much smaller UK to accept them. That is just how it works if you are an almost 500 million people market versus a country only marginally more than 10% of that.

Sure, but the UK can say no, that's the issue for the EU here. If the UK decides it doesn't like the agreement it can be treated like any other third country with no additional agreement (beyond what is included in the WA) in place. At the moment the EU has made it easy for EU firms to remain in the UK market for example, they'll likely continue, but they don't have to.

And yes the UK market is only about 1/7th of the EU market, but it's bigger than anyone bar Japan that the EU has a trade deal with, it's  twice as large as all bar the top 15 economies and larger than the bottom 120 combined. It's not a small country. It can't force the EU to do anything either of course, but it can say no.

>With Scotland maybe leaving the UK (and many expect N. Ireland to do the same in the long run) there is a bumpy ride ahead for the UK.

It remains to be seen if either leave.. I'd certainly prefer them to stay, it's their choice..

>But we will see. Right now many brexiteers still have a big mouth and utter empty threats because they have not arrived in the world of international negotiation yet.

Right.."
1440,Part of the issue is that the UK wants forever rights even if things change. The EU of course wants the ability to revoke access as they have with other countries.
1441,">We should keep in mind that both sides are talking tough before the negotiations have properly kicked off. 

Sure.

>But we also have to remember that the EU won't accept any watering down of its regulations. 

The UK isn't in the EU, it won't require the EU to water down anything.. Generally countries aren't regulated by other countries after all.

>So I think in the end the result will be a no deal, or the UK concedes that it has to abide by EU standards and regulations in exchange for a certain degree of free access for its companies to the EU market. Probably with financial services being the most important factor. Given how far removed from reality the rhetoric especially in the UK has become, a no deal looks increasingly likely.

Probably not. The request here was for longer term guarantees to financial services access, that would have been worth something (in terms of stability). If not, it'd be accessing EU markets on the same basis as the US does. IT's less than ideal, but still manageable.  The only way this ends with no-deal is if the EU decides it really does want everything hooked together in one deal, which the UK seems keen to avoid this time."
1442,"They do not understand that they left this free trade zone, not zone them. As u said hard way will teach better lesson then any word."
1443,">The current approach is the same that we had for the last three years, the UK representatives consider they are entitled to all benefits and none of the responsabilities of being a member state, they use the EU as scapegoat for the baboon cage is their parliament and their mismanagement of their whole country for the last 20 years, the EU says no to all of their pretensions, they get a no deal.

Not really. The UK has said it doesn't want to be in the SM repeatedly and that it would prefer a more distant relationship. It has been clear that it wants to give up the benefits of EU membership.

The EU has only just apparently figured out that the UK really does intend to leave the SM and CU. You can probably also throw in that those supporting the EU on this seem to get really confused about what the 'costs' and what the 'benefits' or EU membership are, because things like FoM seems to suddenly get shoved into the costs pile when the UK suggests it doesn't want to continue that either.. Rather than a benefit, which is how it is sold the rest of the time (and frankly should be..).

>The UK keeps pushing ludicruous and delusional deals, the EU keeps saying, no, and that is the end.

Not really no.. 

>The UK will learn the hard way this lesson, they had made their own bed and are responsible for everything is happening, the EU is obligated to nothing.

Sure, the point though is that that results in a no-deal, which is far from optimal for either side. It isn't a disaster for the UK or the EU, but hey. The EU does have what amounts to a peak amount of leverage now, if it fails to pull together an agreeable deal, it'll be somewhat wasted.

>Keep in mind that this will be every single trade deal that the UK bargains for from now on they are not part of the EU, they will always get the band end of the stick when bargaining with other superpotences, as they do not need the UK but the UK needs them, hence the lack of bargaining power.

Erm yeah. That's not a thing unless you think that Canada, Japan, Australia etc.. are all getting the bad end of the stick from the EU (they aren't..). The thing with trade deals is that if either party doesn't like the outcome, they can just say no."
1444,"> Neither are comparable in size to the UK though, not by any stretch, 

Size is irrelevant though. The EU treats member states equally and it wants to treat non-member states as equal to each other when agreements are formed.

To be honest, your attitude is exactly what we expect from Leave voters - claim beforehand that we can ""have our cake and eat it"" and expect the UK to do what's in its best interest, but then complain the EU is being ""unfair"" and ""jealous"" when it attempts to do what's in ITS best interest.

And you were warned. You've been warned many times that the EU holds all the cards. Get used to this, because this is what will happen when we negotiate deals with the likes of the US, China, India and Australia - we are now a small fish in a very big pond, despite the lies the Leave campaign have told. More fool you for believing them."
1445,"You said initially you want the UK just not being treated worse than other noon EU countries. I then point out that it is not the case anyhow, by giving examples. To which you indicate that the UK is a much bigger economy. And that you would not want the status of Switzerland.

So you prove my point then. You do not want the conditions Switzerland has to accept, but you still want the trade advantages they have. Because you feel the UK is entitled to it due to its ""importance"" as reading partner.

So you do not want being treated like the others. You want a special treatment."
1446,"> The UK isn't in the EU, it won't require the EU to water down anything.. Generally countries aren't regulated by other countries after all.

You don't seem to understand that in order to trade with other countries you have to agree a set of rules. The EU's rules are that they won't accept free trade with countries that don't abide by its standards. The UK is saying it won't align itself with those standards.

The ball is entirely in the UK's court here. It can abide by the rules the EU sets or it can decide not to have a trade agreement.

The UK needs the EU a lot more than the other way around, and the EU is much, much bigger than the UK. This is not an agreement between equals. This is like the UK trading with Mali. They need us more than we need them, so they'll bend to our rules. With the EU we get the reverse. 

Get used to it."
1447,"The EU has no trade deal with Australia, and mind you, Canada and Japan have a more important geopolitical position than the UK."
1448,"> It has been clear that it wants to give up the benefits of EU membership.

No. No it **really** hasn't. Boris has, in fact, been promising exactly the opposite.

My friend, you are in for one hell of a shock in the coming year or so as the UK finds itself repeatedly on the raw end of trade deals.

We know you'll try to blame the EU, but when we also get a poor deal with the US, who are you going to blame then?"
1449,">And mind you, Canada and Japan have a more important geopolitical position than the UK.
