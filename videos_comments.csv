14,"When I was a teenager I worked for Papa John‚Äôs and we used to see who could fold the boxes the quickest. I never personally won, maybe a second place or two though. The winner would normally get a free pie of their choice, and some of them were possibly even quicker than this person. Such a weird skill to have, lol."
15,I love that she didnt wash her hands before going back to the oven. Parasite ahoy.
16,"Maybe parlay it into a pickup line?

""Hey boy, you wanna see how fast I can fold you?"""

35,So kind.
36,"Ya wtf, her other videos aren‚Äôt like this. This one gives me the creeps"
37,I've decided that I absolutely detest how that woman takes that pasta out of that bowl with those spoons.
38, I have some devout relatives coming in a few weeks so where can I get them! Take my money!!!!
39,I just looked it up - you can find it on Amazon. I want to abide by the rules here which is why I am not providing you with the link. But search for it and it‚Äôs right there.
40,"The one I see on Amazon dosent have tongs, the eyes are attached.still pretty good"
41,Wonder how many artists there thought he was actual decent at vocals
42,This level of scared shitless is unknown to me...damn
43,"This is an amazing 9 minutes of footage.  The earthquake going on and on seemingly forever only to have it wane and see the tsunami get closer and closer and then eventually overtake the land...

This is one of the those times when you have zero control over anything and can simply do your best and watch as the horror unfolds."
44,"That building is a **fucking**

#Tank!

I didn't even see a broken window pane!"
45,Fuck that's horrifying.
46,Horrifying
47,"Interestingly, there were no planes visible."
48,Life is really RNG.
49,As someone who experienced Earthquakes and now lives in Florida. I rather take on 3 Consecutive Hurricanes than a level 9 Earthquake.
50,brave cameraman: https://youtu.be/k_5-IF5cAvA
51,"Damn, that shit is crazy. I would be thanking Jesus if I were in a place like that instead of at home when that water came through."
52,Horrifying..
53,I wish I was there for that
54,"Thank God that airport terminal is built of adamantine  is sturdier than a fortress

Took a 9.0 and laughed off a tsunami"
55,Yeah.. this is fkn horrible ;(
56,"only 2 minutes, but seemed like a long time when watching this video, and probably felt like half an hour if in the middle of it. Truly terrifying"
57,"Uh you will have to wait ,Jesus is hanging out with Santa while hugging the American flag right now with emperor Donald trump. They are kinda busy for your pettiness."
58,"Thank God for decent building codes and engineers and builders working to the highest standards.  

It's in Japan so you know they placed a high priority on 'doing things right'."
59,Fake as a lake
60,[Extremely relevant (La Chancla)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSicdnahJ7o)
61,"Can the receiver get far enough down the field?

Rodgers. In trouble.

It‚Äôs gonna get there.

Turned 32 yesterday. Does she still have a vintage moment in her?"
62,She needs to be training with Mitchell Trubisky this offseason.
63,who throws a shoe?! really?
64,The chancla is strong with this one
65,She should be at the NFL combine
66,I thought so too. Looks like the sandal flickers in and out of existence during the air time.
67,But lakes are real...
68,In Hobbs and Shaw movie the funniest  scene is where the samoan mom threatens the Rock and his brother with a slipper (slip-pa)  They cower to her out of respect!  See at 0:10 secs  https://youtu.be/Lg5XKuaXse8
69,Yeah they could use some of that CGI magic to make it look less fake
70,"Someone has been reading too many MSM article titles

If you learn the **truth** from conspiracy YouTubers that peddle supplements and questionable ""experts"" with crippling vices and foreign connections,

You would know lakes were a hoax perpetrated by an immensely powerful cabal that is too incompetent to stop me, the YouTubers, or our chosen leader."
71,Is cgi legal in the nfl?
72,I will make it legal.
73,"The camera work, the actor's expressions, the score. 
Truly a work of art, 10/10"
74,for anyone who speaks French it is less fun to listen to someone speak French as a second language.
75,I needed the English subtitles to understand the French
76,"The guy clearly did that as a joke only and didn't spoke French, it was really hard to understand even with the subtitles.

It was funny though, it would be nice to get a redub!"
77,"‚ÄúWait, Shia Surprise!‚Äù"
78,What in the Shia is going on here lol
79,That cheese part! Oh my gosh...I didn't realize how big of a dad thing that is.
80,Cheese? .... Cheese?
81,"I couldn't agree more. Now that the whole series is out, you can actually binge watch it. Everyone needs to enjoy this. (Time loop Dad is my favorite)"
82,This üëè Is üëè Amazing üëè
83,"Damn it, I hate when a video is really well-written and well-shot but no one bothered to think about microphones. Listening to this was difficult. Literally."
84,Anybody want cheese?
85,Cheese?
86,Oh goodness she's a adorable üòñ
87,Well it's a very fitting name.

99,Private video.
100,"It‚Äôs so small, we can‚Äôt see it."
101,Now thats next level
102,Because the entire industry is a monopoly.
103,"I enjoy it when I find out about these companies that operate under the radar or don't get any media attention. People often complain about the same 5 - 10 companies being a too large with beyond reasonable market power or a danger to privacy or consumer rights (and chanting ""break them up"") etc., then you find that the industries with 100+ global companies giving the illusion of choice and free competition, do in fact have the majority of its -supposedly competing- companies operate under the same conglomerate."
104,"We've been using Zenni since 2006, and my wife just ordered another pair yesterday.  My transition, oleophobic, scratch resistant, UV coated ones cost me $42.  There are other competitors, but they have impressed us time and time again through probably 20+ orders.  Hell with paying $800 after being told I have ""great insurance""."
105,Garfield's reaction is the underdog of this video.
106,"Emma did finally meet Emma https://www.instagram.com/p/ByqOq-Iliag/?utm_source=ig_embed

Stone and the Haim girls went to the Spice girls in London and they even did a La La Land cover as a tribute to her"
107,"I love Graham, he's without a doubt the best talkshow host out there.

Witty as fuck, always engaged with his guests, and occasionally has some fantastic moments like this one or the one where [Will Smith sang the Fresh Prince theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwS14TiO7Pk) (just ignore his son). :)"
108,"Probably a close second is Ellen and Kristen Bell's Sloth video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5jw3T3Jy70

https://youtu.be/t5jw3T3Jy70?t=182 for the correct time of the troll, but the whole video is great."
109,"Emma Stone is so hot, her voice is unreal as well. She will always be a babe"
110,[deleted]
111,"It's a good troll, but I still think Kristen Bell on Ellen about the sloth is the ultimate troll."
112,Made room on the couch for the non-existent spice girl
113,Yea he was def in on it and selling it hard. That was awesome. This show is amazing. Norton is a treasure
114,Wow - did not expect Baby Spice to look like that
115,Skip to 1:23 to skip the son bit.
116,"He is among the best. His energy is positive, his humor is great, the flow is good etc. Absolute pleasure to watch."
117,Dax and Kristen Bell are so fucking cute. I'm pretty sure I'd react like she did regarding the sloth if I were to ever meet them. And I'm a grown ass man.
118,Though cute - that's the close 2nd?
119,Apparently her voice is from having colic as a baby which is a condition where a baby will cry way more than normal. They think its caused by gas pain. It damaged her vocal cords and now she has that sexy voice as a result.
120,Sure lol
121,nice ad
122,Found the BBC intern
123,I just posted this video.  They're both golden.

And it actually worked XD"
127,That was 23 fuckin years ago bro shes 45 now
128,"I know Wes Anderson is known for symmetrical shots, but he really went ham on this trailer"
129,Each Wes Anderson film that comes out is even more Wes Anderson than the last Wes Anderson film.
130,its like the concept of wes anderson has coalesced into a huge penis and its just cumming all over my face
131,Well that just looks fantastic.
132,It's been a while since I was actually excited about a film.
133,NO CRYING
134,The song covered in the second half is Christophe's Aline https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU9qYbLtPog
135,Jeffrey Wright without facial hair will take some time to get used to.
136,Is everyone in Hollywood in this movie?
137,I'm still convinced he cast the girl in Moonrise Kingdom simply to break the symmetry.
138,You should be ~~talking~~ excited about Rampart.
139,"hmmm i want to call bs on this vid, but need more proof."
140,"Ok we saw them walk with arms through the street, but did I miss the killing somehow?"
141,Seems edited/fake. But I'm more curious about what the original footage is actually from.
142,"This is highly suspicious, since they're not wearing hazmat gear."
143,Whoever believes this video is lacking some critical thinking skills.
144,A hoax I‚Äôm sure
145,"Though I personally want this to not be real, knowing the history of China and their way of reacting to problems like this I won't just put it down as fake. I would like to know more about this before I make any personal conclusions."
146,bullshit
147,This is obviously fake. I mean jeez. The added sounds persist through the jump cuts...
148,"fake, the gunshot sounds allone sound almost silly"
149,Hoax
150,I don‚Äôt buy it.
151,Propaganda.
152,It sounds like whoever‚Äôs recording is in a crowded area which seems to not be the case
153,Fake
154,What's REALLY happening here? Cap'n?
155,"Im not american so I dont know how real guns sound like but these sound more like firework than guns imo. 

China may or may not kill their citizens due to Corona but well its China so this wouldnt be the first atrocity they have commited. But its kinda frightening why the police even have to bear ""bigger"" arms than pistols and even run around with them in hand instead of being secured around the body."
156,Does the sound really match this video?
157,A death squad going house to house killing people would have to be of a much larger size. The population would be literally running and scattering in the first minute of shooting.
158,This is China. No need for fancy suits. Next man up.
159,"China make people disappear, they don't gun them down in the street."
160,not at all. looks like BS.
161,It could be that this is just one way they do that. I dont have a ton of experience in the study of modern China but I will say I am sceptical of it while not doubting.
162,"[Oh, but they have.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests)"
163,You're talking about a mass protest that turned into a riot and a massacre. That's completely different from the situation we have right now in Wuhan.
164,....
165,"""Dear LockPickingLawyer -

I have enclosed three locks for you to open as a gift. I have been watching your videos for years, and with each passing day, I become more sure. Your voice calls to me, like an angelic choir. I watch the swift, nimble movements of your fingers and wonder what they would feel like on my own body. Rest assured, my lock is not so easy to pick and will require a good bit of teasing, and maybe a little action from the tension wrench. When I see you post your video of these locks, I will know that the seeds you have planted in me, I have also planted in you.

With love from your #1 fan,

Logan in California"""
166,"I'm definitely fully of the belief these days that no lock is secure - you're just paying for a deterrent. 


And the deterrent isn't to stop someone from breaking into just your property - but to make someone elses look more lucrative."
167,"He admits that he cannot pick a Bowley lock. It is designed to shield the pins so they cannot be reached with a pick. The only way to ""pick it"" is to reverse-engineer the key. That said, with enough blunt-force anything can be opened."
168,This trailer is like if you told an AI to analyze all of Wes Anderson's movies and create the most Wes Anderson trailer possible.
169,I do not understand
170,Nice Tati reference at the start [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mtluyHcOnk)
171,You had me at Bill Murray.
172,what does the diagrammed sentence mean?
173,Pretty much exactly what I expected.
174,Will there be a frog in this movie?
175,And I'm still so excited for it.  He's got a very distinct style but that's why I like his stuff.
176,"Me neither, but it's Wes Anderson so I'm down."
177,And Frances McDormand
178,You had me a hello.
179,They will fail to notice the torn ticket-stub for an unclaimed hat which sits alone on the upper shelf of a cloakroom in a bus depot on the outskirts of the work-a-day town where Nickerson and his accomplices were apprehended.
180,"I do enjoy his movies but they're all becoming so similar. This might as well be the grand budapest moonrise tenenbaums. He did the animated/stop motion stuff which was cool but I wish he would do something like Rushmore again, its still his best movie in my opinion. Again I know its his style but he also does awesome movies when the focus isnt, 'lets see how zany campy we can make this'."
181,"Curiously enough, that sentence would make for an easily memorized and really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really strong password."
