Basically during my first year of uni, me and a few of my friends found ourselves waking up at around 6pm everyday, we would go to sleep and it would be dark, and when we woke up it would be dark. Not long after, we all started developing/relapsed with, anxiety, depression etc, and one of my friends even had to drop out after being diagnosed with a really disturbing case of psychosis. After trying everything, from resetting my circadian clock, pulling all nighters, sleeping pills, cutting down smoking and drinking, working out before bed, eating well, specialist alarm apps and necking a can of red bull in a semi-conscious state, I got really frustrated, and the only time I could get into morning lectures was when I had stayed up from the night before, also I did think about keeping window and curtains open at the time but my room was ground floor and faced the courtyard where everyone would congregate, at the time, I didn't understand why I could wake up fine when I was at my parents home, but not during term time. 

Fast forward and I failed my first year, but unlike most of my friends I decided to give it another shot, some mates and I moved out of halls and into a bright open plan apartment. After my first sleep in the new room, I woke up naturally at 8am even though I only had 4 hours sleep, I felt great and rested, and woke up like this pretty much everyday from then on. I racked my brain but couldn't understand what was different, until it finally clicked, the new room had pretty crap blinds which let in most of the natural light, whereas my room in halls had thick blackout curtains. I did a bit of research and yada yada yada it's obvious that exposure to sunlight makes waking up much easier, if not natural, and ever since, waking up has been a breeze (most of the time lol)

Just to add, if you try this and other methods and it doesn't work, maybe get checked for any underlying health conditions, it's possible you may have anemia,  insomnia, or a million and one other things. 

TLDR: if you wake up late or struggle to wake up at all, even with an alarm, try leaving your curtains/blinds open or using a translucent window covering.",1580349385.0

Try it!! It's brainless and all you do is squeeze your hand a bit which pretty much anyone should be able to do! A stress ball should also prove to be an effective alternative

Edit: A couple of things to add, the anemia in question is a genetic mutation called thalassemia. It is the result of a blood mutation that causes my hemoglobin to decompose at an abnormal rate, thus hindering my blood's ability to deliver oxygen to the rest of my body.

While this was the first time I tried this, I posted to LPT because the effect was SO noticeable over everything else I've done to try and alleviate the morning fatigue. Memory foam mattress, getting to sleep earlier, morning wank, sleeping pills, melatonin, all these had a marginal effect if any at all. But today, BAM.

47,"LPT: When someone says, ""people never change,"" what they really mean is that ""people never change...for someone else.""",775,evcgzn,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/evcgzn/lpt_when_someone_says_people_never_change_what/,47,"The idea that ""people never change"" was first introduced to me when I was 13, during my parents' divorce. I remember asking each of them why they left the other, and if they could possibly get back together someday. The answer I received from them was ""no, because he/she will never change."" As I grew up, this idea confused me, because I thought that surely people could change. You hear it all the time, as if its part of our culture to know that as a fact. Well, its not a fact. People can and do change all the time. They stop drinking/smoking, stop cheating on their significant others, get an education/better career, lose weight and get healthy, etc. However, more often than not, these people are making major life changes because its what they want to do, in order to better their own lives. Changing for someone else is what's difficult to do, because it lacks to motivational punch that changing to better yourself offers.

I experienced this in my own life a few years ago when my girlfriend of 6.5 years left me. I had gained weight and become unhealthy over the course of the relationship, and after we broke up, all I wanted to do was lose the weight and get back with her. It became an obsession, and an eventual nosedive into depression because all I wanted so badly was to have her back, yet I lacked the motivation and willpower to do what I thought was necessary, lose the weight. Years later, I've realized it's not about losing the weight to get her back...its about losing the weight to make myself healthier, and happier because of it.

tldr; Realize that people rarely change for someone else, however, people surely can and do change all the time. They do so for themselves. Don't feel like you're ""stuck in your ways"" because of the outdated adage that says ""people never change.""",1580277772.0

Structural engineers have to actually go to school and know what codes are in order to pass a test and get licensed.

It’s really easy to get, I got one at 18 when I lived in Florida and I definitely didn’t know enough to do the job right. 

On top of that they almost ALL have clauses that allow them to get away with only a refund of the inspection if they missed anything. 

Few years ago I purchased a house that’s over 100 years old. I ended up hiring the top reviewed inspector in the city of Chicago. Said they had millions in insurance to correct anything they missed. Long story short, they missed over 50k of badly needed work. Home inspector accepted responsibility, you could see the issues in photos in the report. Instead of helping me repair the work, they decided not to help and instead paid me 5k not to write reviews after I threatened to. I had no choice so I took the 5k.

129,LPT: Follow you passion is Bad Advice. Cal Newport had a popular TEDtalk that explained how we find our passion through obtaining mastery in an area. The higher the skills we obtain the more passionate we become,560,euhhyq,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/euhhyq/lpt_follow_you_passion_is_bad_advice_cal_newport/,62,"When we are feeling confused about what we want to do in life the most common saying we’ll hear from others is usually follow your passion. But often they don’t talk about how to do that. They just automatically spit out the cliché because it’s so widespread in our society. Cal Newport suggests “follow your passion” is terrible advice.

The first thing we need to understand about passion, is that passion is more about strategy than inspiration. We usually think along the lines of just waking up one day and we’ll randomly know our purpose. This law of attraction logic most likely won’t work in regard to finding our passions. Most of us find our passions in life through experimentation. It takes a bit of effort and self-analysis

And if you noticed I said PASSIONS, as in plural. I’m pointing that out because that’s another common misconception about passion. That we can only have one almighty singular passion in life. It’s mostly because of the influence of TV and society we think of passion as this singular thing. But it’s not

We can have several passions simultaneously. For instance, I myself love writing, love hitting the gym, love cooking and eat clean foods, and love learning new information. Most of us can have more than one passion. We aren’t bound to only one interest in life. 

Now before explaining how to find your passion this next point is the KEY to being able to become passionate about anything in your life in the first place. **Passion isn’t a starting point it’s a conclusion.** Meaning - we don’t start with passion, but we can end with it. 

Gaining Mastery in a subject is a fundamental part of passion. On the path to mastering anything we become passionate about that subject in general. The main point with this is to choose not only to become good at something, we need to aim high, remember we want to become a master at it and we can’t do that without aiming high. For example, not only do you want to write a book, you want to write a book that makes the best seller’s list. Not only do you want to open a restaurant; you want the best restaurant within 50 miles. By taking this high goal road, we start to look at the little details and intricacies of how everything connects in that field and we just sort of naturally get this need for more and more information about it - then we become fascinated with that subject and it leads us to becoming passionate about it. **Passion is automatic on the path to mastery**. 

So now let’s talk about how exactly we find our passions. I remember in my second year of college I was conflicted with if I choose the right major or not. I was talking to one of my professors about it and he showed me this simple little tool that’s a perfect starting point in respects to finding our passion. First he asked me what do I love to do? Then he asked, am I good at any of those things I love to do? Then finally he said do people need or value any of the things I am good at and love to do. Ask yourself these 3 questions and it’ll lead to your sweet spot in life.

We can toy with this equation too it’s not fixed. If we’re not finding the answer, we can dedicate some time to becoming better at the things we love that we also know the world values. We can even go as far as increasing the list of things we love to do by trying new things. Some we may like, some we may not. If it is not the right choice for you, you will know shortly after starting. But if we keep doing it, as time goes on that list of things we love to do will increase. 

Don’t over analyze or over think this part. Just google a list of hobbies and pick out a few that interest you. That your curious about and focus on one of them at a time to try out. 

Now if your discovering you’re not interested in anything then it’s likely your dopamine responses are off. Dopamine levels can have a lot more to do with passion than we would think on the surface. Paint a picture of yourself driving on a road leading you to your passion. Your dopamine levels being off will make that road foggy. The more cheap dopamine spikes we get from thing like TV, Video games, social media, high sugar foods, and other crap that throws off our dopamine responses off - The thicker that fog will be and the harder it will be to see the road we’re on. Then because the fog can become so thick we might miss an intersecting road that we we’re supposed to turn down or a road that just peaked our interest and would have been worth taking a detour on. 

In order to be passionate about things we need to let go of as many unnecessary dopamine spikes related to instant gratification as we can. When we watch a lot of TV, get high or drunk, or stay on social media all day it gives us an instant high dopamine response compared with what we should be getting as a delayed dopamine response while working on something we’re passionate about. If we avoid these things, we will naturally become passionate and happier about whatever we’re working on in life rather than just working on our image on Instagram. **Our dopamine responses have to come from what we create, not what we consume.** This is very important. With our dopamine responses in check we naturally seek out more dopamine responses through our creations and the work we put into our life. We’ll get our dopamine responses from earned activity like exercising, choosing the right foods to eat, completing tasks, and going for goals. Every instant high dopamine spike activity we let go of will make our road to passion clearer. 

So, in conclusion you can see how finding our passion will take some effort. This is exactly why the biggest block to most of us finding our passion is ourselves. Thinking we will just wake one day and suddenly know our purpose is wishful thinking at best. And when nothing comes to us, we tend to ask others what they think we should choose to do for our passion, defeating the whole concept of passion all together. This decision must be on our terms. Not what our mother or father thinks we should do and not what our friends think we should do. We can take suggestions, but the endgame of our life has to be a result of our own choices; and the biggest problem we have with passion, most of us don’t even get a chance to chase it, because we give up our dreams for a paycheck

e.g. “You wouldn’t want a drink, would you?” Instead of “would you like a drink?”. 

What I’ve noticed using this is that customers will say no 70% more often using the former rather than the latter regardless on whether or not they would like said offering because of the negative connotation and the subconscious thought of the offer not being accepted often by other people because of the word “wouldn’t”. This means that the average customer will think that you’re a polite person and will usually have something good to say to you or about you.

Earlier today, I met an elderly gentleman at work (I'm a police officer).  He was nice enough, but it became clear that he was basically just looking for some company.  I made contact with this guy, who we'll call Jim.  Jim had a very simple problem - He was too weak to get his garbage pail down to the curb for garbage pick-up day and wanted to know if we could help him with that if needed.  Of course, this is the type of stuff we're here for.

Jim is wearing a WW2 veterans hat with a Sergeants pin on the brim.  I ask him ""Jim, is that your Sarge's pin on your hat?""  To which he responds yes.  We start talking.  Turns out, Jim is from a tiny US midwest town and went to WW2 in order to ""do what needed to be done"".  ""We had no idea about the Nazi's when we joined up...we just wanted to serve our Country""

Jim went on to tell me stories that literally left my jaw hanging.  He said he didn't like to talk about things, but because I was a police officer, he would talk with me.  How he was in France, Germany and, later, the Pacific.  He told me about his nurse wife, who ended up running off while he was away.  His new wife, who ended up passing of cancer.  His 2 boys, both of whom were also in the military.  He told me about how when he got out of the service and the war was over, how he went to work in his hometown as a factory worker.

Jim told me that he almost never spoke to anyone regarding the war and his experiences.  I asked if he ever spoke to his wife and kids, and he looked at me like I was nuts.  ""They have no need to know of these things.""  Fair enough I suppose.

He told me about people he had killed, in person, and right in front of him.  Almost as if it was simply a job.  ""Them boys had mama's, I knew it, but i tried not to think about it.""  Jim told me about factory life and his growing family..

Long story short, I asked Jim if he had talked to others about this, and he said, verbatim, ""who?  My kids are grown.  I don't see them.  You young people are so busy these days.""

tl;dr  This guy just wanted someone to talk to for a bit.  He wasn't annoying, he wasn't long-winded.  He was lonely.  At one point, he told me how he used to harvest corn on his dads farm.

I just wanted to share some tips on how to be comfortable and successful at work, school or anywhere else you have to communicate with other people. 

A very important thing is to not act how you feel. 
If you really dislike the people you're around and you have (bad) thoughts about them, don't show it.  Stay neutral.  Being hostile isn't the way to go, so the best thing to do is just go on about your day, and don't cause problems for yourself (unless you have to.)

If you're having a bad day, try not to let that have an affect on how you treat other people, or, affect your appearance.  You don't want to have negative energy.. that will turn people away from you (that's not good), unless that's what you want. 

If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.  This is said very often, and in this case, it's helpful.  If what you say is going to offend someone, you probably shouldn't say it, just for your sake.  Even if you don't think you're being offensive, everyone doesn't think the same way or handle things the same.  So be mindful of what you say. 

If you need to remind yourself of these things on a daily, do so.  It will help!  If any of these are you and you really want to change, it is possible.  With work and determination you can better yourself.",1579955051.0

Once the cap is removed you can use nail clippers or scissors to remove the locks on the inside of the cap. Now the cap is free to come on and off the bottle, and you can refill it as many times as you'd like.

Me and my wife want to help him, **badly**. We are not fit ourselves but we encourage each other to work out on the regular basis. We always try to invite him and encourage him to work out with us. We’ve invited him to hike, to run… to walk even, like just going to downtown or going to a town event. We even installed a 100 lbs. punching bag in our back yard that we (wife and I) train with every evening after work ([here](https://imgur.com/Xf6WnQw) is a still of a video we took. It is not much but it’s honest workout). We have all the necessary equipment (extra gloves, extra wraps, extra jumping ropes…) for him to just put on and follow up, have himself start as he sees fit and later push him to do certain drills once he gets better at it. We use a fitness app that teach us how and what do to on all levels of experience but the thing is, he lacks motivation — he has none whatsoever and we fear that soon it’ll be too late. I just want to find ways to reach out to him on a personal level and help him. If we can’t then maybe a psychologist will do the trick but he also refuses that mean (I personally had gone with a psychologist for more than a year and it has been a wonderful experience for me and it really helped me A LOT to learn about myself and my life and I am truly grateful for that).

He is into gaming and I am as well (PCMR), maybe I can reach out to him through there? He’s about to finish his engineer degree and he has yet to find himself a job. He does not have a lot of social life other than his gaming and university friends. He goes with them like once every 1-2 months or so…

Please Reddit, how do I motivate him to be healthier? How do I make him understand that it is not too late? That he has us for help, that he will not be judged. That getting healthier will have such of an enormous positive impact on him. I dream of the moment he starts noticing his weight reducing.

I was a bit suspicious so I left and went to the Apple store that had just opened to ask them and be sure about the whole situation.

Expanded version, because I like talking too much:
My phone was getting worse and worse at charging, I would put the cable in and it wouldn’t charge. 

I would try the connector at a different angle and that would work. It would vibrate every few seconds as the connection was flaky.

It helped if if twisted the cable around the phone to keep the connector at a certain angle.
I was ready to give up. 

Finally, I realized that I’m an idiot, and that the connector port was gunked up with lint and fibers and, well, gunk.

So I took a paperclip, scraped the inside of the lightning port, and voila, it’s good as new.

It can also include nonwage income such as savings, trust fund distributions, unemployment compensation and others.

Especially if the hand-eye coordination isn't there for them yet and they're more likely to bash their own eye or nose. If you wanna try this, I suggest using a regular bath cloth instead of an infant/child one as the fabric is more coarse and provides distracting stimulation to the gums combined with the cold; think of it like how you rub an injury to make it feel better.

When those tiny teefers started peeking out, I would graduate them up to pieces of frozen waffles for the same relief and cold numbing, but with a yummier incentive not to throw it and the ulterior motive of training in more hand-eye coordination to feed themselves. Now before anyone gets fun ideas of other frozen foods to try: waffles are the only knaw-able foodstuff I found that could retain its shape while thawing out in a warm hand and not turn into a mushy mess on the highchair tray; be cautious. And don't try frozen pancakes. No one likes soggy bread. Hope this helps someone out there!

For obvious reasons, people always frame their CV's in the most positive way, and they will be on their very best behavior during interviews. But an applicant who seems great on paper and during an interview may actually be extremely toxic.

**Always call past employers listed on a CV, especially ones that are not listed as references. You could save yourself a huge headache down the road.**

I once hired someone who was great at selling herself during the interview. I thought she would be an excellent employee. Later she started to show her true colors. She had a toxic attitude and clashed with every other employee. It ended with her throwing a tantrum and technically assaulting me. I'm 100% sure that if I called one of her previous employers, red flags would have been raised.

Another person I hired later had a good CV and also did great in the interview. Like an idiot, I also did not call her previous employers. She wasn't as toxic as the other person, but she is a complainer, gets upset about the most petty things, occasionally clashes with others, and overall has a bad attitude. Out of curiosity I called one of her previous employers months later, and my suspicion was correct. They told me she was competent but her attitude was bad. At the rate that she is going, she will be out the door soon.

The bottom line is, it's much better to have an employee with average skills and a good attitude, than a slightly more skilled employee with a horrible attitude.",1579735660.0

Right of way is a set of rules designed to maintain order, especially when vehicles are involved. Vehicles *are* dangerous and carry the very real capacity to injure or kill. It is extremely important that minimize this danger, which is partly done by maintaining order and thus keeping things predictable.

By giving up your right of way, you are not being friendly, but instead you are opening up the situation to become more unpredictable and dangerous. Obviously make sure others are yielding to your right of way before taking it, (again for safety as other drivers and pedestrians often make mistakes purposely or not) but don't give up your right of way for no reason.

Refresher for the U.S.:

- Whoever arrives at a stop sign first gets the right of way
- If two people show up at the stop sign at the same time, the person to the right gets right of way 
- Someone already on the road has the right of way over someone turning onto that road
- Pedestrians have the right of way at a crosswalk (unless signals say otherwise)

For example, a dealership was charging this woman $900 + parts to replace her headlight. If you have screwdrivers and various ratchets and sockets, that's a 15-20min job. 

Or when Geek Squad tried to charge my Mother an arm and a leg just to diagnose her laptop screen (which I already knew was the problem), plus parts and labor. That job literally entails a bit of prying, a few small screws, and a ribbon cable. You can check the screen you need by looking at the part and model number on the screen. Then search it on ebay and purchase the replacement. Reverse the order to fix it.

Or, a dealership that wanted thousands of dollars to replace this family's struts and springs on their van. Get me the parts and I'll have it installed in a few hours. 

At most, I'd charge you a 6-pack and MAYBE a pizza depending on the time of day. I can go on and on about the examples I see. If I can't do it myself, I can either learn (YouTube, Internet, books, etc) or I at least know someone that can help.

We are in and out of those places multiple times for many different reasons on a day by day basis. We quickly get familiar with the patients, the RNs CNAs, LPNs, sometimes the physical/occupational therapists and janitorial crews. We see the day to day living conditions and treatment of patients. We see things, hear things, (smell things!) and sometimes have to deal with things inside of those facilities.

That being said, I'm not trying to scare anyone, most facilities are great! But there are other facilities we dread getting calls to, and some we feel bad we have to drop patients off at. EMTs do the job for various reasons but we as individuals are not loyal to any one facility (even if our company has the contract it is the company that pays us, not the facility directly) and from my experience, we are willing to honestly tell someone what we think of certain facilities.

Things to consider when you want to ask. First, find out which local company has the contract with the facility(ies) you are thinking of placing your loved one in. It is not hidden/private knowledge so the facility should be able to tell you without an issue.

Second (and important!): Do not approach any EMTs while they are with a patient, OR if they are inside the specific facility. We may be truthful, but it is possible to get in trouble if someone from the facility hears us talk negatively about it. Wait until you see the EMTs without a patient (empty stretcher) and at least outside of the facility. Best thing would be to be as far from an entrance as possible. If you happen to see an EMT at a store, chances are they have a few minutes to answer some questions.

Third: do not ask them while they are transporting your loved one. I typically got asked this question by a family member in the back of the ambulance with their awake and aware family member while we were heading to said facility as a new admission. I felt bad, but tried to be as truthful as possible without negatively talking about the facility. For me, it made me feel awkward as you are already heading to the facility, its too late to change places, and I wouldnt want you or your loved one to go in thinking its the worst place.

All that being said, we do not see EVERYTHING going on inside the facility and we have experienced varying stories from patient to patient. But there are some facilities that we as EMTs can all agree are terrible and those places are the ones you want to stay away from. I also understand sometimes placing your loved one in a facility could rely on insurances, so your options may be limited.

The seller chose us over someone who was offering more money with a large down payment (we offered the full asking price with a $0 down payment).

Houses in my Midwestern US city regularly sell at or above their asking price after only a day or two on the market. This means that there are often multiple offers from which a seller can choose to accept. If you suspect that you don't have the best offer, you can write a personal letter to the seller to explain who you are and what living in the house would mean to you. Don't grovel or make things up, just explain the connection you feel to the property. Including a nice picture or two also goes a long way toward turning you into a human instead of numbers on a sheet of paper.

In our example, we didn't get to meet the owner before submitting an offer; however, we knew a few things about him just from touring the home. We saw doggy food bowls in the kitchen, so we included our dog Watson in our letter (he even signed it!) It was apparent from the garage that the owner liked cars; I included a line about how I was hoping to use the big garage as my shop. Lastly, our agent said the seller would finish renovating the basement before the closing.

A typical coffin measures 84"" x 28"" x 23"" having a volume of 61,023 cubic inches (CI). The breathing rate when entrapped is 763 CI/minute, oxygen consumption is 31 CI/min and carbon dioxide expelled is 24 CI/min.

Volume of oxygen is 21% of the total volume or 11,360 CI and the initial CO2 is zero. Breathing the trapped air in the volume you would consume oxygen and expel CO2. Carbon dioxide concentration is the governing survival parameter in this case.

As the carbon dioxide content of the inspired air rises, the breathing rate becomes faster. Normal air is 0.03% carbon dioxide. The TLV-TWA (time-weighted threshold limit value) for carbon dioxide is 0.5 per cent , headache and an increased rate of breathing occur at 1%, at 3% a doubling of normal breathing rate occurs. Panting and intoxication occur above 5% with unconsciousness at about 10%.

Given the breathing rate above, the CO2 concentration would increase over time. Using a breathing rate of 763 CI/min the CO2 concentration would reach 0.5% after 11 minutes, 1% after 22 minutes, 1.26% after 28 minutes and 3% at 65 minutes.

Some of the grocery bags are weaker and have holes in them but others do not. Grocery chains have different quality bags. 

So long as you reuse your grocery bags as garbage bags I don't see how it would be worse for the environment. 

You essentially save half of your money if you reuse. You also save on the cost of those sturdy cloth bags. The environment also takes a hit when those bags are made. The cardboard box that the glad bags come in are also taken from the environment whereas the grocery store gets thousands of bags in a single box, reducing the amount of cardboard used.

Rough calculations: 
4 small garbage bins in your house which you change once a week. This is 208 per year and reusing grocery bags would save you ~$10 per year.

The issue would be if you end up with too many grocery bags. So to resolve this you would use a combination of cloth bags and just enough grocery bags. Then donate that extra $10 a year to an environmental cause or keep it.

When you ask ""do you have any questions?"" it pre-supposes that the person doesn't have any questions. It's like saying ""you don't have any questions right? because if you did, you're stupid"". It's even worse if you are in a position of authority over the person your explaining something to (i.e. you're a teacher, a supervisor, etc...)
When you ask ""what questions do you have?"" it's like telling the person ""I expect you have questions, it's ok to ask for clarification"". It will totally change the responses you get, and the effectiveness of your teaching.
I'm a doctor, and I frequently need to explain something to someone that I understand better than they do.

I see my colleagues all the time fall into a trap where they use big words, don't explain things in terms their patients can understand, and then intimidate them away from asking questions.
No matter what it is you're explaining, remember that if you are the one teaching or explaining something, you're doing so because you know more than the person you are talking to, and so it's only natural they will have questions.

""Bad publicity is still publicity"" is how modern journals make money, they make clickbait article designed to spark outrage so as to make people react and tweet about it for example, and then the tweet about the article will spark outrage even further, and the people seeing the tweet will probably continue the outrage chain by tweeting, retweeting or sharing to another social media, etc...

That's the reason why when the current U.S. President do or say something stupid it instantly shot up to the front page and you can't escape it for a few days/weeks, meanwhile the articles that aren't outrageous but report on important news get buried (unless it's something affecting so much people, that those people spread the word around on social media).

That's also the reason why (bad) reality TV make so much money, and once again the irony is that the more people complain about reality TV celebrities being famous for no reason, the more they'll be famous.

And that's also why brands now ""have"" political opinions (more like what a bunch of marketing guys thought would help the brand's image the most while also sparking ton of reactions), everyone has an opinion and politics are very divisive, so this is a perfect recipe for outrage between the people disagreeing with the brand and those agreeing, and all those social media post created in reaction will contain the name of brand, you've basically become the ad.",1579410837.0

You might end up hating the look of obese people (for example), even when you didn't originally have any such thoughts.

This picking up of behaviour is sort of like the hive mentality. You may see it even on Reddit. Some people downvote something and then the post or comment gets downvoted to oblivion.

Some people genuinely hate something, and people who are neutral likely pick up on it.

If you find yourself hating something or disgusted by something, take a moment to think of why you actually hate it. Do you *really* hate it? Or were you just neutral and picked it up?

If it is some person, try putting yourself in their boots, and imagine yourself in their situation.

Enjoy!   


1. Be flexible on dates and times - I can't stress this enough, if you have a flexibility to shift your departure by a day or two, it means a lot, especially with business-like airports where Monday morning departures and Friday/Sunday returns can get pricey. The cheapest flights usually have stupid early or very late departures because the slots at the airport are the cheapest (Europe), in Asia though late nights are often very busy for carriers going back to Europe etc.
2. To the point above, some airports do have higher price fluctuations than others - so for example your Monday departure can be double the cost of a Wednesday one. This is mainly true for business-driven airports such as IAD (government), IAH (oil) etc. With hubs and airports with mixed profits, the fluctuations are less present - however some days might see much more departures than others due to scheduling.
3. Scan for nearby airports on both ends of your trip - especially true with LCC (low cost carrier) however take into a consideration the travel cost from the given airport to city centre.
4. Use multiple flight scanning tools - some routes and combinations work better on one site than the other. Try to use multiple such as Skyscanner, Kayak, Google Flights, Matrix ITA (before Google bought them over), Kiwi and Azair (which is great for Europe and European LCC). 
5. If you fly long-haul from/to Asia on Asian carriers, try using a VPN. It works in more cases but especially with Asian market where you can get lower prices connecting from an Asian country over a European/American one. Sometimes you might need to change the language/currency manually as well, in case the site doesn't correctly change it to the VPN location
6. If you fly primarily with legacy airlines and not LCC, try to make your way up in one of the alliances to gain perks - so check what airlines are in Star Alliance, One World and SkyTeam and see what airports are around you and work with that. Often it's worth to pay a little bit more for a flight within the alliance to build your FFP status rather than choosing a cheaper flight but with a difference alliance. Airlines/alliances also offer family accounts that can provide more perks and you should be able to ramp up your status more quicker. 
7. Also, to get more points and build up your FFP status, consider an airline/alliance partnered/issues credit card. You can get a lot of points just for sign up, for active use and even get some free flights on higher tiers. If you fly a lot, airline-partnered credit card can save you more money than a regular one with better cashback for example.
8. You don't have to clear your cookies when searching for flights. Doesn't work. That's not how airfare pricing works. Your local cookie doesn't affect a ticket price on an individual level. Overall, airlines provide certain number of tickets for certain prices for each flight. The pricing itself can be quite complex and consists of things like route's base fare, fuel price, airport slot price, date/time to departure, any promotions going on etc. 
9. If you have time and you are not fussed about short connections, check out airport's website to see what airlines operate from there and try to add a stopover or two to your itinerary, the route can get more complex but the pricing can go down. Flying direct saves a lot of trouble and it's more comfortable however if you add one or even two connections on long-haul, price can decrease quite a bit. You can always plan a day trip for those stop overs (visa permitting).
10. Open-jaw tickets can be real gems. Many airlines do not actively advertise open-jaw tickets because on certain routes they can work out fairly cheap comparing to classic return ones. This works well for neighboring countries for example if you plan to make a trip for example to India and Nepal or Indonesia and Malaysia etc. There are three main types of open-jaw tickets - destination open-jaw meaning where your return flight goes from another airport back to the original one - A>B, C>A, origin open-jaw - A>B, B>C or double open-jaw - A>B, C>D.
11. Alliances offer global/around the world tickets that can work out really cheap if you know your route and you can make it work with their planners. For example, check out One World and their [Explorer and Global Explorer](https://www.oneworld.com/world-travel) fares.
12. [SeatGuru](https://www.seatguru.com/) is your friend. When you book your ticket, checkout SeatGuru's guide for the given aircraft to know what seat you should check-in based on reviews, on a long-haul, this can make a difference.
13. If you want to travel on a specific type of an aircraft due to its quality, seating, noise level etc., you can use [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com) or a similar service to check historical flighting data for the given route to plan that and see what planes the airline normally operates on a given route.
14. Sign up to/follow multiple websites that list cheap flight deals and error fares and set up price alerts for different parts of the year so you don't miss out on any deals - [Fly4Free](https://www.fly4free.com/flight-deals/error-fare/), [Secret Flying](https://www.secretflying.com/), [Travel Pirates](https://www.travelpirates.com/), [Scott's Cheap Flights](https://scottscheapflights.com) etc.
15. [FlyerTalk](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/trending.php) is your friend. Those guys are very knowledgeable and usually provide solid answers even to the most obscure questions.
16. If you haven't flown with the airline before and you want to know more about its performance, check out [SKYTRAX's website](https://www.airlinequality.com/) on airline reviews. Many people know their awards but they are also good if you need a deciding factor on a specific airline for the given route.

Many of these are probably well-known but I wanted to put these together for anyone who does not travel that often but hopefully some of you find it useful!",1579271526.0

Baby may cry a lot and you will value a way to sooth baby. Hearing a familiar song in Mom's voice is very calming.
Pro tips:
1) sing often when you are walking or moving. Baby is relaxed / asleep when you move and will associate song with relaxation. 
2) sing out loud. Humming in your mind only is not enough, baby can hear your voice but not your thoughts.
3) choose 3 songs you like. If you like them, baby will like them. But best if they have a melody and if they are repetitive (verse/chorus)
4) if you really don't want to or cannot sing, play songs for baby. They will recognise those songs also when they are born. But your voice is best.",1579265509.0

692,LPT: Bills with different due dates making it confusing how much money you really have? Autopay using the same credit card and make one lump payment at the beginning of the month.,22,epur01,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/epur01/lpt_bills_with_different_due_dates_making_it/,4,"I love autopay but I rarely get to pick the day my bills (gas, electricity, internet, memberships, etc) are automatically deducted from my account. It was frustrating to have all these different autopay deductions from my checking account show up throughout the month. Now I just make one large prepayment to my credit card at the beginning of the month and have any bill payments automatically deducted from that credit card as the month goes on. This way I start off the month knowing my bills are paid off for the month and don’t even notice the little hits on my account because I already took one big hit at the start of the month.

They say to avoid using your credit card but in this case you’re actually pre-paying before anything gets spent on your card so as long as you pay what you know you’re going to owe in bills including paying down your credit card, you’re good. I called my bank to check and my credit card only charges interest on the total credit balance at the end of the billing cycle (not on new charges that are prepaid or paid off that same month) so this works for me without paying any extra interest. 

This trick may not apply to everyone but it has made paying bills much easier. If you don’t have a credit card, 0 credit balance (lucky you!) or pay by debit/check/etc. then an alternative is the envelope system which is also a great way to make paying bills more organized. (google: Dave Ramsey Envelope Bills System)

Side note: I know not all bills are payable with a credit card but it’s a lot easier to manage those few when the rest is taken care of. Also, yes I look forward to the day that I have 0 credit balance and I can no longer use this trick. Working on it!",1579260747.0

Inevitably in the comments I see the OP saying that they ""have a credit card but don't use it because they're scary."" I felt the same way when I was younger before I understood how credit and credit cards really worked, so I thought I'd maybe help some people and dispel some of the fears around credit cards. 

The fear around credit cards comes from hearing all the nightmare stories about people tanking their credit when they were young and they're screwed for the rest of their life. And while that's definitely possible to do, it doesn't just happen out of nowhere on its own. Those people whose credit was ruined early in life saw that they had a $4000 credit limit on their card and didn't think what it would take to pay that off and just racked up a ton of debt. If you use a card wisely and stay within your means, credit cards can help you a lot now and especially down the road. 

First let's talk about how your credit works and how credit card companies make money off of you. Your credit is based on a lot of things in some weird formula that really nobody knows exactly. Essentially there's a thing called your debt to income ratio, which is literally how much debt you have total compared to how much money you make. There are some debts that are excluded in this for whatever reason, but this ratio is usually how creditors determine whether you get approved or what the terms of your loan are going to be. The messed up thing is that they, the credit companies, want you to have debt because people with no debt are somehow less appealing and I'm not sure why that is. Credit card companies want people to get their cards and use them a lot because they get a percentage of each purchase made with your card on the back end, and then they also make money off of the interest they charge the consumers. So your goal should be to use your credit card, have some small amount of ""debt"" each month that you're making good payments on (if it's something like a car or mortgage loan) or you're paying it off every month so as to bypass the interest, then you make more ""debt"" the next month and so on. 

If you have a checking account with a bank I would apply for a credit card through that bank, look for a card with good rewards and then see what happens. You won't get declined for having no credit or no credit history, credit card companies look to acquire new customers in young people and, in their eyes, take advantage of some of the people that misuse credit cards and rack up debt. But you, the smart consumer, can take advantage of this and build your credit positively. I would suggest going in to the bank and sitting down with an employee that can go over all the important details of a card i.e. interest rate, billing cycle, rewards, penalties and whatever else. Most Bank credit cards all have around the same interest rates, however some cards may have lower interest rates but no rewards, I would stay away from those as they are usually used for things like balance transfers or large purchases that you don't want to take a loan out for, but all that is a different conversation. 

So, you got approved, probably for like a $2000 credit limit, now what? Well, the big thing to keep in mind is how the interest rate applies to your purchases and paying your card off early. Basically, if you go to the store and buy something with the credit card there isn't any interest applied until the second month that the balance is on the card, meaning that if you buy something and pay it off every month you won't be charged interest and it's basically like paying cash, but you are building credit and also you get rewards points with most cards that can go towards gift cards and stuff. My suggestion would be to use your credit card in place of your debit card and then just pay off your credit card every month and you're good to go. People run in to problems when they use their credit card and don't pay it off every month and just make minimum payments. The minimum payments are set to benefit the credit card companies more than the consumer as they barely cover the interest, so essentially they're set to pay off the card in the longest possible time which causes you to pay a ton in interest, which is again where the credit card companies make their money. 

Finally, don't be afraid to apply for credit cards. People say that credit applications mess with your credit, and while that can be true if you're applying for seven cards a day, applying for one here and there won't negatively impact your credit after a short while. The only time you should definitely NOT apply for any new lines of credit is when you're applying for a mortgage, and your mortgage loan officer should tell you the same thing when you're going through the application. 

One thing I will caution everyone on is big box and retail store credit cards, so things like Best Buy or American Eagle or Walmart. On the surface they're the same as a bank credit card, but they always have these ""zero interest for X months"" promotions. These, again, can be used to your advantage if you do it right, but nobody at the store will tell you this and a lot of people get screwed because they didn't read the fine print on the card agreement during the application. Almost all retail stores have an interest rate on their card of upwards of %30, their promotions for no interest bypass that interest for the allotted time, but only if the balance is paid IN FULL by the end of the promotion time period, if you fail to do so you'll owe the interest for the entire promotional period even if you only owe like $10. So let's say you buy a $1200 TV from Best Buy and they offer a 0% interest for 12 months promotion if you use a Best Buy card. Obviously you should take it, but when you do just set automatic payments up for $101 per month to make sure that the balance is paid by the end of the 12 month period. You're essentially paying the same as you would if you just threw $1200 cash down and paid for it there, only it's spread out over 12 months, you build credit, and you kept that big chunk of money in your pocket. Win win.

All in all, new adults generally don't get educated about how to properly use credit to your advantage and it hurts them in the long run. I'm no financial guru but I have been through some stuff in my life that has taught me about these things. I went to buy my first car when I was 25 and I got shafter on the interest rate because I had no credit history. But, now a few years later I have a house and a car and a good credit score/history and some manageable debt that I make more than minimum payments on. Hopefully some of the stuff I learned can teach some of you how to use credit to your advantage and how to build it properly. Ask your parents or someone you know that is good with money to sit down and explain this stuff to you first hand if I did a poor job simplifying it, it's usually easier to digest when you see how these things work yourself.

So please don't shit on me for my effort. This is just one way of establishing your authority while working in a corporate. There are obviously a lot of other ways that could be better than this. I'm not saying that this is the best method. Nevertheless, this method works and it will get you results pretty quickly.

Let's say that a previous manager quit and now you're managing his old team. You don't have much interaction yet but you want to establish authority on them.

One way to achieve this is to check the work that they're doing in detail. For example let's say you're a QA Manager and your team is updating incidents. Then you see their comments, check with the developers/support or whoever is involved in that incident whether the resolution provided is enough for them. You will sometimes find that they missed certain scenarios in the defect. You could point it out to them and request them to test out those additional scenarios as well.

Next, you check the emails that they send (ask them to include you on all emails). If they're talking about scenarios try to find some additional work that they could do along with whatever they're already doing. Either talk to the person in the ""To"" field and find out or use your own experience if you understand the product. Usually you'll find some additional work that could be done to increase the value. Reply back to the email and ask your subordinate whether he also performed the X activity. Request him to do it.

This establishes your authority for everyone in the ""To"" + ""CC"" fields. It also let's your new subordinates know that you're monitoring their work closely and they need to maintain a high level of quality.

Will they hate you for it? They might. A little.

In Gmail you can do it through:  
Gmail -> Settings -> General -> Images (Ask before displaying external images - This option also disables dynamic email.)

After taking a security course in our IT company, have learned one important lesson that thought it was nice to share. This risk is the ""smart"" spam and it's very easy to solve .

Many companies sells your data to other companies which later will bombard you with spam. A company can know many things from the actions you take on the emails.

For instance, when a spammer sends you an email, they can know if the email exists or not, but even worse when you open the email they can confirm that you are a real person and that your email account is active. They do this by using a pixel tracking technique; briefly... it's an image of one pixel size that is hosted in the spammer company server, when you open the image, you load it from their servers... this way they know you opened the email and you told them you have an active email account.

This might sound simple but it is not. One real example of this has happened to me. The company I worked for has 600 employees, some of these employees (including me) received spam from other software companies and opened these emails. The spammer company confirmed the email accounts, our company domain, tracked our company and started calling by phone to our employees and gave very accurate data of our employees, doing even worse a reverse engineering of the business and obtain sensitive data. This is why I said... not a simple thing.

In order to prevent this pixel tracking technique, you can enable in your email client a feature to prevent loading images automatically. 

In the case of Gmail, you can go to:

Each meal-prep session will take a few hours, but you'll save yourself having to cook, you'll ensure portion control, you'll waste far less food, and you'll save a fair bit of money.

Vacuum sealed meals last up to a year in the freezer and have very little degrading in flavor.  In each cooking session it will take me and one other person \~1 hour shopping and 2-3 hours cooking/sealing to make between 40-50 meals.  Every 3 weeks on average I'll whip up something new, and it creates a good variety in the freezer.  This likely doesn't make as much sense for larger families, but for 1-3 people it's perfect.  We almost never throw away food.  This is not for people who don't like their foods touching!  Freezer space (such as a side-by-side freezer) is also a must.

You can reheat meals in the microwave that are vacuum sealed with a small hole cut in them and they won't get dried out, which is what kills reheating leftovers.  Letting the food thaw out in the fridge before helps ensure things heat up more evenly.  Thawed out meals can last up to 2 weeks in the fridge due to vacuum sealing.

You can get fairly cheap vacuum sealers for $30 on Amazon these days.  Vacuum bag will add \~$.10 onto each meal.

Here's some examples of what I do, I have \~15 recipes I cycle through to keep variety going.  High-protein, high-fiber, higher in good fats, and low sodium is what I aim for personally.

**Lunch/Dinner Example: Burrito Bowl**

**Cost:** \~$1.35

**Calories:** \~450-475

**Instructions:** Cook brown rice/chicken stock in pressure cooker on long-grain setting with 1.25 broth to 1 rice ratio (add garlic to taste). Please in fridge.  Add cumin and salt to beans in pressure cooker and cook \~30 minutes.  Remove all meat from Costco Chicken.  Sweet corn can be cooked on the stove with butter/Parmesan, but can also be added frozen.  Cut up onions desired thickness and fry in oil or butter.  Chicken can have flavoring added such as BBQ or Buffalo if desired. Vacuum seal and freeze each bag containing: 1/2 cup rice, 3oz chicken, 1/2 cup corn,  onions at a desired level and 1/3 cup black beans.  Move from fridge to freezer the night before you plan on eating the meal and microwave for \~2 minutes to prep.

|Item/Serving size|Cost/Serving|Calories/Serving|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Brown Rice (\~1/2 cup cooked)|$.05|120|
|Costco Rotisserie Chicken (3oz)|$.45|145|
|Costco Sweet Corn (1/2 cup)|$.15|60|
|Chicken Stock (\~1/2 cup)|$.15|20|
|Onion|$.10|40|
|Black Beans (1/3 cup)|$.15-30|70|
|Salt/Cumin|$.05|0|

I made about 50-60 of these last time I made them for \~$70-$80.

**Breakfast Example: Brown Sugar Banana Oatmeal**

**Cost:** \~$.60/serving

**Calories:** \~300

**Instructions:** Vacuum sealer not necessary, ziplock is fine... though vacuum sealing will increase how long they last.  Combine oats, cinnamon, sugar in bags ahead of time.  For a bit more calories/protein add your favorite nut.  Heat up water, add to mix and wait a minute.  Cut up banana and add on top before serving.  These meals last \~3-6 months.

|Item|Cost/Serving|Calories|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rolled Oats (1/2c)|$.2|160|
|Cinnamon (to taste)|$.05|0|
|Brown Sugar (1 tbsp to taste)|$.05|35|

The operator wants information about person and vehicle descriptions, involvement of weapons, anybody impaired by drugs or alcohol, etc.  officer safety is paramount and they are trying to be fast and succinct.

Another thing I did not know at the time, was there is a cap on how many credits you can take before financial aid cuts you off. I was taking CNC machining courses on top of the degree program to give myself a 2nd option.

2 years down the road I moved to a different state and wanted to take courses in 3D animation and modeling. After going through the enrollment process, all the advisor meetings, getting a schedule set etc. the Friday before classes start I get called into the financial aid office.

I pretty much gave up on returning to college after this and realized I was stuck working my way up in what ever companies I could get my foot in the door with.

This may not fully apply to salaried jobs, but it definitely applies to shift workers. 

Take your hourly rate, factor in any breaks if they’re unpaid and work out to the penny what you’re owed every week/month. It’s easy enough to do with an excel spreadsheet and a few bits of basic formulae. 

Then when you get a payslip, it will tell you your gross pay and net pay and should also have a breakdown of, for an example 10 hours worked at £10 an hour that’s £100. If the figure you have doesn’t match upto the net pay, there is an error somewhere along the line. 

I’m also going to add onto this, if you don’t receive a payslip, ask for one and when you get it, keep them all filed away somewhere so you can refer back to them. 

I’m currently having an issue with my employer on hours worked and I have been underpaid for a fair amount of hours, this prompted me to start documenting them.

First you must try to get rid of the natural tendency to take what people do and say as something personally directed at you, particularly if what they say or do is unpleasant. Even when they criticize you or act against your interests, more often than not it stems from some deep earlier pain they are reliving; you become the convenient target of frustrations and resentments that have been accumulating over the years. They are projecting their own negative feelings. If you can view people this way, you will find it easier to not react and get upset or become embroiled in some petty battle. If the person is truly malicious, by not becoming emotional yourself you will be in a better place to plot the proper countermove. You will save yourself from accumulating hurts and bitter feelings. 


See people as facts of nature. They come in all varieties, like flowers or rocks. There are fools and saints and sociopaths and egomaniacs and noble warriors; there are the sensitive and the insensitive. They all play a role in our social ecology. This does not mean we cannot struggle to change the harmful behavior of the people who are close to us or in our sphere of influence; but we cannot reengineer human nature, and even if we somehow succeeded, the result could be a lot worse than what we have. You must accept diversity and the fact that people are what they are.

I learned that caffeine was contributing to my tension and stress generally, was increasing the likelihood of panic attacks, was limiting my ability to control them, and was greatly enhancing the intensity of the attacks. If you are like a lot of people who consume caffeine daily in coffee, tea, sodas, energy drinks, etc., you may be surprised at the significance of caffeine’s role in causing or increasing anxiety. 

Another related factor is sugar consumption. Many people consume a large dose of sugar with their caffeinated beverage. Anyone who has seen how kids act after they’ve eaten a lot of sugar will know how similar sugar is to caffeine in terms of amping up energy levels and causing the mind to race. Racing thoughts and heightened energy levels spell doom for anxiety sufferers. Combining sugar with caffeine creates a ‘one two punch’ energy boost. 

Here are a few ways to approach this:

* If you feel anxious often, lower your intake generally

* Avoid caffeine (and possibly also sugar) when you know you will be in an anxiety-inducing situation

* Some people may need to avoid caffeine entirely

For me, my most difficult anxiety problems came in the form of claustrophobia, which was worst when flying on airplanes. So these days, while I do still love a good cup of coffee most mornings, I plan ahead for a flight day by decreasing my coffee intake each day for several days before the flight, so that the day of the flight I have zero caffeine in my system. If you consume caffeine daily, quitting cold turkey one day without having weaned yourself down can cause bad headaches. Take a few days or a week to get off of it gradually.

When I think back to all the panic attacks I had on airplanes, not to mention all the anxiety I had daily for weeks leading up to those situations, it now seems bizarre to me that I didn’t realize that the two enormous coffees loaded with sugar that I would have before boarding the plane were contributing to the problem. 

Today I feel about 95% cured of anxiety. Caffeine and sugar regulation aren’t the only things that helped me to conquer it, but this alone was tremendously helpful and a crucial factor to address. Whether your anxiety is severe and often, or mild and occasional, remember that the substances we consume affect our mental health and our ability to regulate our mood, our physical state, and our thoughts and emotions.",1579042658.0

957,"LPT: If you’re upset at anyone for any reason and plan on confronting them, wait at least 24 hours.",782,eo2rbc,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/eo2rbc/lpt_if_youre_upset_at_anyone_for_any_reason_and/,39,"When you feel you’ve been slighted or treated unfairly by someone, it’s natural to feel the need to confront the person immediately. Doing this will most likely only lead to more conflict for a few reasons.  

Your emotions are probably high and very unorganized, while the other person may or may not be completely unaware that you are upset at them. Confronting them immediately in an urgent and accusatory state will likely cause the other person to have a defensive response to the situation, possibly being caught off guard, and nothing will get resolved. Not to mention it could possibly escalate or worsen the initial situation. You likely haven’t had time to process what happened and gather your thoughts into coherent points/questions that actually look to get answers and resolve things rather than a way to release your initial anger.

Waiting at least a day to voice your issues with somebody allows you time to come down from the knee-jerk emotional response, as well as collect your racing thoughts or accusations into meaningful points that you can calmly bring up at an appropriate time. During the day or more that you wait, don’t focus on the issue. Instead, go about your day and life normally and push the situation out of your mind to rest from it, knowing that you will revisit the issue when your own obligations are complete and when you have a quiet moment alone to thoughtfully consider it. This also gives you time to consider that there is always a possibility that  you could be wrong/given wrong information.

Remember that when dealing with other people, you are always working with incomplete information. Typically, things didn’t happen exactly they way you think they have BEFORE you become aware of the details and reasonings for someone else’s actions. Also remember, the end goal of any conversation like this is to resolve an issue, and not to release impulsive anger onto somebody. You will feel much better if the problem actually gets solved peacefully. So, take your time.",1578942698.0
