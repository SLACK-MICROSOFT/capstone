He’s averaging:
27.1 PPG (eighth in the league)
4.1 rebounds (N/A)
6.4 assists (seventeenth in the league/ third in SG)

The record is the only thing that holds him back, he has better stats on a much improved team (that empty stat narrative). They have a chance to make the playoffs and he would be the biggest reason why. 

Also in consideration for player of the month in the western conference:

January stats:
31.6 PPG (highest) on 52% FG
4.3 rebounds
6.4 assists

With the way so many of us have reacted to Kobe's passing, I think it's hit a lot of people that you don't really appreciate something until it's gone. There are so many of us right now that wish we could reverse time and make it so that the crash never happened. To bring Kobe back.

But if that were the case, and the helicopter never went down, would you still appreciate Kobe and Gigi and the others we lost as much as you do right now? Would you appreciate Kobe's life if you never knew he came back from death?

So think of all the other possible timelines or scenarios where someone else was on that plane. Or someone else was taken from us far too soon. It could be LeBron. It could be Jordan. It could be your team's favorite young star. It could be anybody in your personal life. And if that person was on that plane instead of Kobe, think of how you'd be mourning them. How much you'd appreciate them. How much you'd wish you could revese time and bring them back. Now come back to this place, to the here and now, and realize we're living in the timeline where those people are still with us.

For all of these people we still have, we don't have to wonder ""what could have been?"" We can just look at what is. And we can appreciate that to the fullest.",1580358950.0

9,The Gap of Talent in the Eastern Conference Continues to Grow,1,evsgcw,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/evsgcw/the_gap_of_talent_in_the_eastern_conference/,28,"It has been discussed often that the Eastern Conference has been on the rise the past few years, but it seems to be only at the very elite level. The Bucks, Raptors, Heat, Celtics, Sixers and Pacers are all clearly in the top half of the nba, as all of these 6 teams are on track to post 50 win regular seasons.

The remaining 9 teams make part of perhaps the worst collection of talent we might have EVER seen in the eastern conference.

The current 7 seed Magic: 21-27

The current 8 seed Nets 19-26

Will the East get better next season? 

It’s debateable. The nets will probably improve with a mostly healthy Kevin Durant, and with a strong youth core of the top 6 teams, there is reason for optimism.

However, with teams like the meddling Magic and Pistons, it could be very possible these teams go into a full rebuild. To further add, it does not seem like the Cavs Knicks and Hornets will be ready to compete by next year.

What are your thoughts on this polarizing gap in the east? Is the east relatively better or worse than usual? Will it ever come close to catching the west?(It’s been over a decade)",1580357660.0

The last time this happened? Dec. 6, 2000, where Kobe and Antawn Jamison had 51 apiece.

- Dec. 8, 1961 Phi Warriors vs. LA Lakers between Wilt (78) and Elgin Baylor (63)

- Feb. 25, 1962 Phi Warriors vs. NY Knicks between Wilt (67) and Guerin (50)

- Dec. 14, 1962 GS Warriors vs. LA Lakers between Wilt (63) and Baylor (51) again

Here is the [chart](https://i.imgur.com/1eVP3GP.png).

""Catch And Shoot"" shots are those which were shot directly after the pass by LeBron. Usually, those are jump shots, dunks and layups.

""Created"" shots are ones that required a few extra dribbles after James passed the ball to the player who scored the basket. Such shots came from drives or post shots mostly. 

Just a note, this is a pretty much rough estimation, as there is no specific categorization of assists such as this but there is a type of each shot, so I tried to take a look at some videos of some actions to ""conclude"" which is true catch and shoot, and which isn't.

7 apg x 65 games per season (give or take, although it’s possible he’ll play more) for 4 seasons gives him 1820 more assists

6 apg x 65 games per season for 4 seasons gives him 1560 more assists

I personally think it’s entirely possible for Lowry to average 6 apg for 4 more seasons. He’s still currently playing at an all star level, and while his minutes will likely decline as he ages I believe he’ll look to score less and play out his twilight years are more of a facilitator. Top 20 all time isn’t guaranteed, but it is possible.

**To finish top 20 in 3 pointers made**

Lowry would have to aim for the 19th spot considering Damian Lillard is ahead of him and is all but guaranteed to knock Peja Stojakovia out of the 20th spot.

Therefore, Lowry needs to knock down 151 more threes to match Rashard Lewis’ record of 1787.

*Assuming he plays another 4 seasons*

If he attempts 5 threes per game at 65 games per season at a 36% rate, he would knock down another 468 threes, he would finish his career with 2104 made threes for his career which would rank 10th all time.

**Things to keep in mind**

- He very likely won’t end up 10th all time in 3 pointers made considering there are plenty of active players high up on the list (Reddick at 14, LeBron at 17, Klay at 18, Lillard at 23, Wesley Matthews at 25, Durant at 28, Paul George at 34, etc.). Still, top 20 is entirely realistic and I would even consider it likely.

- I lowballed a lot of these numbers just to stay on the safe side. For example, it’s possible he plays greater than 65 games per season. It’s also likely he attempts more than 5 threes per game (he’s attempted 7+ for the past 5 seasons) so his total 3PM will likely be even more than the numbers shown.

- I didn’t include numbers for the remainder of the current season, which will obviously add to both totals.",1580345018.0
45,Searching an incredible Kobe Story,0,evpax2,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/evpax2/searching_an_incredible_kobe_story/,15,"Hey Fam, like most of y’all im devastated right now and overall feel like I’m in a really dark place. I’m Starting to cry every few hrs when I see New Kobe reactions by other greats. 
I’ve seen a lot of posts that helped me keeping Kobes spirit alive and all the love he gets is just incredible and makes  it a little bit less worse. I am searching a story about Kobe tho that I remember from a YouTube video. Most Kobe storys are well known about his trash talk and work ethic and just how Crazy he literally is when it comes to basketball but I’ve only heard of this story ONCE but it’s by far the most crazy I’ve heard so far, it goes the following: 

it was on a basketball court I don’t know if pre game or just practice but I think it was pre game practice in a Arena. 
Kobe missed nearly all of his shots and just couldn’t hit any jumpers in that practice. He figured something must be wrong. So he looked at anything his shooting form , the floor idk just anything. But then he came to the conclusion something gotta be wrong with the Basket. So he asked the responsible guy for the baskets and the guy came & checked the basket. The guy was shocked because Kobe was right the basket was off a little bit but only A few millimeters like 1 or 2. This story to me is just crazy I hope it’s not since i only heard of it once in my life. Sorry for poor formatting I’m on mobile right now. Love y’all brothers stay strong 
Rest In Peace Kobe & GiGi 
Others of course as well ❤️🙏🏽",1580344840.0

47,Something occurred to me today - the internet has ruined the fun in my basketball watching experience over the years,3,evpalz,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/evpalz/something_occurred_to_me_today_the_internet_has/,25,"Lets say reddit was around in 2007 when the Wolves traded KG to Boston - it probably wouldve been a ton of memes about how the Wolves suck and all we got back was Al Jefferson and some other young filler players for a future hall of fame player.  I probably wouldve ended up rooting against the Celtics to be honest

&#x200B;

But the reality is, and other Wolves fans can attest to it, that we were all Celtics fans for that 2007-08 season, and mostly for the duration of his time in Boston.  We wanted to see our guy win the titles we couldnt give him in Minnesota.  But that was before there was widespread online discourse  about the NBA (yeah there were forums that were somewhat active , RealGM, ESPN, etc) but nothing like it is today with Twitter , reddit, facebook, youtube .  They were not ubiquitous whatsoever 

&#x200B;

So it brings me to the inevitable KAT trade that will happen at some point, maybe in 2021, maybe 2022, whenever it is.  Im afriad the online discourse leading up to that will make me despise a player I respect a lot right now.

&#x200B;

Anyways, to the older (30+ year old) users here, what are some moments that happened pre-2010 (before the online sports talk really blew up) that you think you wouldve taken in differently had they happened now in this modern social media age?",1580344807.0
48,"Did you know that Tracy McGrady, a 6ft 8in SF/SG, averaged 1.9 blocks per game in 1999-2000?",41,evpafb,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/evpafb/did_you_know_that_tracy_mcgrady_a_6ft_8in_sfsg/,34,"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcgratr01.html

That sounds pretty crazy to me, considering he played in 79 games that season (started 34). He was only 14 blocks behind Tim Duncan who played 413 minutes more.

The stat is even crazier when you see that during his prime (let's say 2000-2005) he averaged the following blocks per season:

2000: 1.5

2001: 1

2002: 0.8

2003: 0.6

2004: 0.7

Basically as soon as he left Toronto he would turn into a high volume scorer and while his steals/game number went up, his blocks/game number went down.

I mean, he's big for a SG/SF (I guess), but 1.9 is quite a lot, right? Last season, the non-big with the most blocks/game was KD and he had 1.1. A total of 84, compared to T-Mac's 151.",1580344784.0

77,[OC] Most Efficient Teams by Shot Location,44,evnc36,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/evnc36/oc_most_efficient_teams_by_shot_location/,24,"tl;dr: [Chart](https://imgur.com/xvblgOt)

We may be in the golden era of the three-point shot, but the two best teams in the league are the two teams who are most efficient with their shots at the rim. 

Using data from the NBA, I mapped every shot taken by each team this season and binned them into hexagons, ala Kirk Goldsberry. I then calculated every team's points per shot for those attempts in each hexagon to find out who has been most efficient from each location. 

###[This chart](https://imgur.com/xvblgOt) shows the result.###

Each hexagon represents the team with the highest points per shot from that location. 

For example, the Bucks generate about 1.3 points per shot on either side of the rim, which is tops in the league. Meanwhile, Portland (thanks to CJ and Melo) and San Antonio (thanks to DeMar and LaMarcus) are well represented in the mid-range. 

You'll notice that there are several blank spaces just inside the three point line. That's analytics Erne -- no team has taken 30 attempts from those locations. 

**Note that the points per shot calculation does not include shot attempts that led to free throws. So if you're team is really good at generating fouls from a certain location, then they may be underrepresented on this chart**

Up to this point, I had never watched basketball before. I didn't have a TV. I played at school for fun quite often but knew very little about the NBA. I was 13 years old and had very little understanding of the NBA.

I was at my friend's house and he had the Sonics game on. They were playing Kobe Bryant and the Lakers. My friend was watching and I was interested so I watched as well. I didn't quite understand much but what I knew was Kobe was kicking the Sonics ass. He would go on to score 45 points with 12 3 pointers. I could not fathom what I was watching.

From that day on, I became hooked with basketball mostly thanks to Kobe. Basketball became a huge part of my life. I looked for every opportunity to play and still do to this day. 

I remember clearly watching his final game with a couple friends at Buffalo Wild Wings. Originally, most of my attention was on the Warriors season win record but Kobe quickly took all my attention away. I still remember the whole restaurant's excitement, waiters stopped serving momentarily to watch Kobe dominate. It was such an unforgettable moment. 

Thank you Kobe for inspiring so many of us, and for those of us who were not fortunate enough to witness Jordan, you were more than enough to bring the passion for basketball to us!

106,This is my first post on here. My mom passed away a little over a year ago in my Junior year of college. I wrote this story last year and was lucky to have it make the front page of the Sports page in my city’s newspaper on Mother’s Day. Hopefully it helps some of you as you deal with Kobe’s loss.,69,evk9tg,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/evk9tg/this_is_my_first_post_on_here_my_mom_passed_away/,8,"[ Sports can be some of the most influential, as well as powerful, fragments of memory in people’s lives. People will often respond with a certain moment involving sports when asked to recall their favorite memory. To prove this point, let me share with you one of my favorite memories in life. 

As you may have already guessed, it does involve sports. But it also involves one of the few things more influential than sports in our world, a mom. I recall being a young boy who hadn’t quite made the transition into loving sports yet. My mother would have much rather watched anything else besides a program involving a ball.  However, through some twist of fate, we ended up tuning in to watch Game 7 of the 2009-10 NBA Championship. 

Out of the two teams competing, I rooted for the team in the purple and gold because I thought the uniforms looked cool. My mom, of course, followed suit.

At some point in the game, our perspective on sports changed. We had become mesmerized by the program featuring men dribbling a ball. I even recall my mother urging, “Come on Kobe”, at multiple points in the game. The Lakers won in the end, but that fact has nothing to do with this story. The part of the story that really matters is the next chapter.

Eight years later, my mom was diagnosed with Stage-III Breast Cancer. One day after a round of strenuous chemotherapy, my mom experienced her first and only seizure of her life. The aftermath left her unconscious for over 12-hours and with temporary amnesia. She struggled to concentrate as well as remember anything in the couple days that followed. However, I will never forget two questions that she was able to answer when I asked her. 

The first being, “Who am I?” 

She smiled and said my name. 

The second question was a much more difficult one to answer. “Do you remember who we watched play in the NBA Finals when I was a kid?” 

She rolled her eyes at me as if I had asked her a stupid question, or that she didn’t currently have issues with her memory. She then smiled before saying, “The Lakers.”

The final chapter didn’t quite pan out the way I, or you as the reader, would hope. My mom wasn’t able to make the comeback victory that we as fans, and I as a son, long for. She did, however, manage to force a legendary Game 7 before finally losing a close one in the end. I guess that’s proof that the best player doesn’t always win. 

Honestly, I doubt Kobe himself would have made a difference against the super-team that she faced. 

But the moral of this story is that sports are more than what they appear and have almost divine power in our lives. Neither my mom or I will ever forget those two Game 7’s. And just like Kobe, my mom hung up her jersey and retired as a champion. ]

Thanks for reading guys. The death of Kobe brought back a lot of painful memories of my mother passing. I’ve found that it helps enormously if you try to focus on the happy memories you have in order to offset some of the pain. I find solace in the fact that we will always have our memories of our loved ones, and it’s a beautiful part of sports that can never be taken away from us. Hope you all are finding healthy ways of coping with Kobe’s passing as well as anyone else’s that you might be experiencing. God bless",1580315768.0

I used to watch the playoffs/Bulls games with my cousin in the 90's but didn't start really following the NBA until Kobe came into the league in 97. I became a huge fan immediately. I remember in the 99 season when Kobe finally got to be a starter, being really excited that he was close to averaging 20 ppg. In the last week or so of the season, I remember having a little notebook where I figured out how many points he needed to get his average up to 20, and then being heartbroken when he finished 4 points short.

Bryant’s Clippers workout is not nearly as famous, largely because it did not lead to a storied career. With the seventh pick in the draft, the Clippers selected the older, taller Lorenzen Wright — a selection Fitch and Hecker say they do not regret. Each felt the Clippers’ organization would not have been conducive to success for a teenager.

In a “long talk” with Bryant after the workout, Fitch said he shared with Bryant how impressed he was by what he’d seen, and also concerns about the organization as it was run by former owner Donald Sterling.

“He knew where we were coming from,” Fitch said. “He knew the Clippers were in need of a lot of help and were in dire need of a lot of things, including ownership. We had a lot of long talks about what he should do and where he should go and I said, ‘I can take you and you can play 48 minutes a game with anybody I got here, but it’s not going to be the career I want for you.’

“He benefited from us not taking him and money-wise he probably got more getting drafted where he did than he would have gotten out of Donald Sterling. I didn’t want him to have to go through all the things we were going through there.”

Fitch, who coached the Clippers from 1994-98 and was a 2019 inductee into the Hall of Fame, said Bryant later “thanked me a few times for not putting him in the mess that we could have put him in with the Clippers.”

119,I hated Kobe,932,evj4tt,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/evj4tt/i_hated_kobe/,76,"All this love for Kobe I thought one of his haters should speak up. I’m a sixers fan. Idolized iverson. I have this friend, the obnoxious kind that will argue anything for the fun of it. Imagine skip bayless is your best friend. That’s him. Obnoxious Kobe jock rider. We would spend hours arguing who was better A I or Kobe, and up until about 04 05 I thought I had a pretty good case. Well I swear Kobe had our arguments wire tapped or something cause every point I would bring up he would go out and demolish it. I would say things like A I scored 50 in back to back games! I shit you not the very next week this jerk does it 4 straight! One of which against the sixers at a game we were at. I was so mad lol. A I scored 60! Dude went on to do it 5 times including an 81 point performance. I hated the raptors for that. Throw the whole team out. MVP, rings, accolades, one by one all of my talking points were proven wrong. I was eventually forced to say things like “ WeLl PoUnD FoR PoUnD A I WaS BeTtEr” or “If OnLy He WaS 6’6” let’s face it, I lost that battle. So what do i do? I jump ship of course. LeBron is the best player in the league NOT Kobe. On went the debates for several more years.

We watched his last game together at his place. Some people forget it was a pretty rough night for Kobe for 2 1/2, 3 quarters. But he heated up didn’t he? I’m talking mad shit you guys. “Dude this is embarrassing, he put up 28 shots and has 32 points”. But he just keeps chucking it. Before I know it boom 40 points, and dude is feeling it. Then bam 50. No way. Then 60. What did I just see? I’m pretty quiet and my dude is grinning cheek to cheek. He had to make me look like an idiot just one last time.

I remember watching Jordan’s last game against the sixers and thinking how lame it was that he didn’t even wanna play the second half. Not Kobe though. He knew it wasn’t a game that night, it was a show. And he was the star and he went out swinging. It took literally ever minute of his career, but I finally found myself a Kobe fan. Thank you Kobe, for the memories and the bond you’ve helped build between two idiot sports fans. Part of my childhood died right next you, and I’m forever grateful.

124,Why the debate of who’s the greatest doesn’t matter anymore and should instead cherish greatness?,15,eviozk,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eviozk/why_the_debate_of_whos_the_greatest_doesnt_matter/,31,"Listening to Wade’s comments tonight about what Lebron would say if he was in that chair tonight got me thinking about why the barbershop debate topic that’s been around since the test of time won’t ever be put to rest, is what makes these morning sport shows on ESPN and other sport networks basically stay in business to eat up time until another sporting event can be shown and why it’s ultimately pointless to have and won’t ever be the same.

Larry and Magic saved the NBA and brought the league to a new level of popularity. Those two battled from college to the NBA and the fierce rivalry on the court is what made them great friends off of it. MJ then came into the league and in one of the three disc sets in the ultimate Jordan DVD set he says in an interview from
one of his early seasons he played so hard because he just wanted to be on the same level as them and have their respect.  

Jordan becomes the guy and the metric that everyone else measures themselves too, but Jordan just wanted the respect of his peers. 

Kobe was the one guy who openly and blatantly said he wanted to be greatest ever and emulated everything MJ did from the walk and the trash talking to the fade-away jumpers and the rings!! He wanted those championships and got close, but ultimately he just wanted MJ’s respect. Jaylen Rose said MJ was the original, but Kobe is the remix. 

This brings me to Wade, Lebron, and the rest of the league. I don’t know what Lebron’s goals are except to be the very best player he can be until
his time playing is done. Wade, Lebron and the rest of these guys just wanted to be on the same level as Kobe, they wanted his respect and wanted to show they could do it too, but the media pins these guys against each other and instead of celebrating them they pin them as rivals. I know there’s times when your opponent is your enemy and as it should be in competition, but we then have these debates of who’s better MJ, Kobe, Lebron? 

What’s the point? This tragedy has shook the world and brought the community of basketball to its knees and I feel like now we shouldn’t have that debate anymore of who’s the greatest of all time. We should just enjoy these athletes and praise them for what they do when they compete. It’s not fair to them to pin them
like that when all they really want is to be respected and admired by the fans and their peers. I know we’ll always have this debate, but
for the love of the game let’s cherish these guys, because we just never know when it’ll all end. 

And now, Lebron is going to have to carry this on his shoulders and it’s not fair to him, he never asked for this and his legacy will now be one that won’t ever be complete. There’s nothing he can do now that will put him over MJ and over Kobe, but he’s having one of the all time great careers. We should cherish and admire the work ethic these people have and the drive instead of exploiting it for views and to waste. This was just my thought after hearing Wade and what these guys go through. 
On the final note I’m deeply saddened about this and keep shedding tears whenever I hear someone speak about the nine lives lost. I can’t fathom what an actual family member of theirs must be going through, my condolences to all grieving and all of you reading",1580305816.0

148,Quantifying NBA All Stars,0,evh8us,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/evh8us/quantifying_nba_all_stars/,16,"I wanted to create a simplistic formula for All Star selections so we can remove subjectivity/narrative from the process as much as possible.  The formula for All Star Score (hereby referred to as ASS) is as follows:

(Avg Points + Avg Rebounds + Avg Assists) x (Games Played/ Games Team Played) x (Team's Winning Percentage)

I decided defensive stats (ie steals, blocks) don't matter, nor do they accurately reflect defensive effectiveness (Hassan Whiteside, cough cough).  Defense matters if a player wants their team to win games, and a player who plays excellent defense should be rewarded.  However, I think defensive effort is reflected enough in winning percentage; if there is a stud defender on a bad team, that sucks buddy, you won't be recognized in this formula.  Also, it's the All Star game--no one plays defense anyway.

I've internally debated whether winning and attendance are over/under emphasized in the ASS formula, and decided I don't care.  I'd rather keep it simple and stupid.  Argue the merits of team success, participation, stat inflation, and all that other good stuff to your hearts' contents.

Please note, Kyle Lowry does not lead the league in ASS.  This fact alone may delegitimize the entire operation, yet we press on.

Conclusion:  Well, okay, some good picks, some not so good.  It's hard to omit players like Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Joel Embiid, and Trae Young (who I think all should get in, formula be damned) while guys like FVV, Eric Bledsoe, SGA, and Montrezl get the nod (they are good, obviously, but top 26 is dubious).

I don't think this would be a terrible ASG, but not ideal, especially from a ratings/money standpoint, which is ultimately what it's all about.  Along with a player's legacy and contract bonuses, I suppose.

Russ during his MVP season: 31.6/**10.7/10.4**/1.6 with 5.4 TOV on 55.4 TS%

Small sample size, I know, but it's still insane. He is currently averaging more points on higher efficiency with less turnovers. He's playing better defense as well. Almost as if his cold stretch early on in the season had something to do with him playing with multiple dislocated fingers coming off of knee surgery...

Keep in mind, he currently has to share the load with James Harden; during his MVP year his best teammate was probably Steven Adams.

During Harden's ice cold stretch, he's picking up the slack and legitimately playing at an MVP level.

Not bad for a net negative asset!!

I've translated it as accurately as I could, If I made any mistakes, please suggest what I need to fix:

""-*I leave, I'm go back to Los Angeles tomorrow.*

-**What draws you so much to Reggio?**

-*I grew up here, going around on a bicycle with all my friends, I have so many special memories, it’s special. It’s different, because when we came here by car with all my colleagues from Nike I was  telling them: “Look, you’d never think that one of the best NBA players would have grown up here.”
It can’t be farther from Los Angeles and…a basketball player.*

-**You said that you want to lend a hand to Italian basketball.**

-*Yes.*

-**What do you want to do, what idea do you have?**

*-I hope one day to build a school here for teaching basketball, though not only basketball but all the important “sport” things, writing, marketing, business, all these things. Where you can stay close to your passion, but still do other things that maybe interest you. It’s my dream to have a school that does it, here in Italy. I want to know a little bit about the things that are…  (Asks in Spanish: Como se dice ""que necesito?"" [How do you say ""that are necessary?""]) And I’d like to help very much.*

*I like coming here. Every time I just walk around and all the people are like: “Hi Kobe, how’s it going?”
“Good, good, good.” And they leave me be, that’s it. I’m at peace here, I always want to come back. It’s something different, because in America, it’s difficult to understand but, it’s love and this city is so different. For example: my daughters in America can’t have things I had here, like when I go out with my friends we just walk around, we go to a square get ice cream, we’re talking, having fun, normal things. In America, it’s not possible. I think they’re losing this thing, but if I tell them that, it’s impossible to understand, because they’ve never seen this. But this is the most important thing, to have these moments. It’s difficult to have this in America.*

**-What is your most beautiful memory of Reggio Emilia?**

-*When we did a school play, I was 12, we had a [dancing] ball. This was the most fun thing that I rememberer, very different isn’t it? You probably thought I’d tell a basketball memory, but no. It’s something different because you know, I was together with my sisters and practising for that spectacle before the entire city. That’s what I remember.""*",1580295413.0

179,Interview of a Former Pilot for Kobe’s Helicopter Company (New Information about the Crash and a Pilot’s Analysis),102,evgk5o,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/evgk5o/interview_of_a_former_pilot_for_kobes_helicopter/,55,"[Interview referenced in title, relevant info at 7:37](https://youtu.be/uJNh-GDYN8c)

**Long post warning, TLDR at end:** To preface this post I am going to put out that while I am not infallible or all knowing, I'm a professional helicopter pilot (and lifelong Laker fan) and know a thing or two about those helicopter things. Basically I want to use my knowledge to clear up a few things I'm seeing recirculated constantly everywhere on Reddit, the rest of the internet, and on the news. Some nuance is left out for ease of understanding and other nuance is highlighted when I think it’s important. Additionally, this interview sheds some incredibly important information on ***why*** (in my opinion) this crash happened. For me, knowing the why helps me grieve and have closure, so do with this what you will.

Let’s start with a few basic terms:

**ATC:** Air traffic Control. 

**VFR:** Visual Flight Rules. Weather is 3 miles visibility or greater, and cloud ceilings are at least 1000 feet above the ground. ATC is ***not*** responsible for obstacle avoidance and is only (partially) responsible for collision avoidance if you are radar contact and specifically request “flight following.” 

**IFR:** Instrument Flight Rules. Visibility is less than 3 miles and/or cloud ceilings are less than 1000 feet above the ground. ATC ***is*** responsible for obstacle clearance and collision avoidance, so they have minimum distances and altitudes that each aircraft under their control must be separated by. Think aircraft A wants to head 50 miles north, aircraft B wants to head 50 miles north....ATC may make one of the aircraft hold and let the other aircraft proceed, they might give one aircraft the scenic route and another a direct route, or they may just separate by altitude. You are required to do everything that ATC tells you under IFR (unless you declare an emergency), whether it’s altitude, airspeed, or even what direction you are flying because of them owning the collision avoidance. 

**Special VFR:** For helicopters, this is a special exception that recognizes the unique handling characteristics of a helicopter, and allows them to still fly VFR with ceilings lower than 1000 feet and visibility less than 3 miles, provided they can **remain clear of clouds.** ATC is still ***not*** responsible for your obstacle avoidance or deconfliction, but is responsible for other aircraft under their control (Think a helicopter operating special VFR in the vicinity of commercial airline traffic).

**Pilot Certifications (ratings):** You need a specific certification to operate an aircraft VFR. You need an additional higher qualification to fly passengers for pay VFR. You need another qualification to fly IFR (instrument rating). You need another license (and lots of hours) to be a flight instructor.

**Aircraft certifications:** There are specific airworthiness requirements for an aircraft to be safe for flight (VFR). There is an additional inspection needed (which costs money) to certify an aircraft has the proper equipment for IFR and said equipment is functioning properly. 

Let’s start with what we know:

1. The specific aircraft (S-76) is extremely capable, **had all of the bells and whistles and functioning equipment needed for IFR**, and has an incredibly low rate of catastrophic mechanical failures. Like, near 0.
1. The pilot was incredibly experienced, and **held all the required certifications and currencies needed for IFR flight**.
1. The weather was shitty, multiple airports were calling IFR which means the S-76 would not be able to continue with their flight under normal VFR. 
1. The pilot requests a special VFR clearance, which is a legal request. 
1. His special VFR request is granted, he continues his route of flight after about 15 minutes of holding.
1. Pilot requests flight following as he is flying through the mountains.
1. While transiting the mountain along his route, ATC attempts to confirm twice that he is actually able to maintain VFR due to how bad the weather is at the time.
1. At this point the mountain is interfering with radio line of sight and communications, and tower also advises him they have lost radar contact. **They advise unable to provide flight following due to no radar contact. Basically saying pilot, you are on your own.**
1. Pilot makes a few broken calls, **reports are that he was trying to advise approach he is unable to remain VFR (out of the clouds)**.
1. Flight data shows the aircraft around this time attempting a minimum 700 foot per minute (fpm) climb, completing between 90-180 degrees of turn, and then accelerating at 180+ KIAS and 4000+ fpm rate of descent toward the ground.
1. Aircraft crashes.

So let’s address some things right off the bat: 

* The pilot and ATC were **both completely legal by requesting/granting special VFR.** 
* **It is relatively normal for helicopters to use special VFR in conditions that fixed wing aircraft only operate IFR in.**
* The pilot did not suck, lack experience, or lack qualifications. 
* The aircraft did not suck or lack equipment.
* It is overwhelming likely to not have any mechanical causal factors.

Now let’s address the new information presented in the [video](https://youtu.be/uJNh-GDYN8c). At 7:37, this former employee mentions that the specific company is **a VFR only program**.  Essentially after looking into the company, they operate under FAR (Federal Aviation Regulations) Part 135.  **To simplify this, the company does not pay for an inspector to come verify their aircraft has all the required equipment for IFR flight.** That means regardless of the equipment on board and it's operational status, or the flying pilot's certifications...because the company didn’t pay for the certification/inspection, this *specific aircraft* is ***not legal to fly IFR*** unless that certification is done.

People (me included) have been continually asking the question: “why didn’t the pilot just climb and pickup an IFR clearance.” **This is your answer....he would be committing a flight violation if he picked up an IFR clearance (unless he did so under a declared emergency).**

Let’s put it all together:

* A pilot who is incredibly experienced and is certified for IFR flight takes an aircraft to fly into special VFR conditions that has the equipment needed for IFR flight, but is not allowed to fly IFR legally because the company didn’t pay for the certification.  
* Pilot continues pushing the envelope in bad weather, with no mitigation available. **As he heads out into the marginal weather in the mountains, he can’t just climb and pick up an IFR clearance without declaring an emergency first.** 
* He continues pushing through the marginal, degrading weather, and at some point hits unavoidable (at this point) fog and/or clouds. He attempts to get out of it (sometimes pilots will brief doing a 180 turn to get out of it the way you got into it). 
* He attempts to contact approach, finally requests an emergency climb and states he is unable to remain VFR, **but at this point it's too late.** His call comes in broken/barely readable.
* He gets disoriented in the climbing turn, isn’t able to transition to an instrument scan quick enough, and loses control/orientation of the aircraft while trying to transition to instruments. He is unable to recover and impacts the ground at 4000+ fpm descent.

The biggest WTFs of this entire thing:

1. The decision to fly at all in this situation, for this route of flight, when the aircraft was not IFR legal. That’s complacency and painting yourself into a corner once you’re airborne. This get-it-done-itis put him into a bad situation with the weather **that he didn't have a proper mitigation for.**
1. Kobe hiring/utilizing a company that doesn’t pay for its instrument check paperwork

**TLDR; the aircraft wasn’t certified for IFR flight (due to the company not paying for the inspection, which they are not in any way legally obligated to do) and the pilot tried to push special VFR into the mountains without his aircraft having the best mitigation for flying around special VFR, which is if the weather gets worse...you just climb and pick up IFR clearance/control.**

EDIT: For people suggesting suing the aviation company, I'd equate it to suing a car dealer for not legally requiring the driver puts snow chains on his tires before driving a leased car in a blizzard. I personally don't think there is liability there but I'm not a lawyer.",1580294881.0

“My favorite Kobe story was when we were going back and forth against Indiana and I had fouled out. So I’m thinking damn, here we go again. I [messed] up. Remember I was killing Rik Smits and I fouled out and they made that run? Everybody was worried, including [then-Lakers coach) Phil [Jackson]. And Kobe came up to me and said, ‘Don’t worry. I got it.’

“That’s when he put on that show. That’s when I got behind the podium after the game and said, ‘Kobe is the best player in the world!’

“I was nervous and he was like, ‘Big Fella, I’ll be here. You ain’t got to worry about [anything].’ That’s when I knew he was ‘real- real.’ I always knew he was real.
“But you know how [Michael] Jordan is real-real in the clutch? Magic Johnson is real-real in the clutch. That’s when I put Kobe in that category.

With the passing of Kobe, we've seen a few players intending on changing their jersey numbers to honor him.

It's the players choices to change their number and if they want to do it to honor a legend, let them do it.

# I would like to collaborate with r/NBA a massive project: a fan made Kobe Documentary.

(Update: I have some interested in being interviewed as a fan to give historical context, this is my 3rd and final post looking for anyone interested) 

I would like to make a Kobe focused documentary detailing his early childhood, through his career, and his tragic death. I have 5 years of editing experience in video and audio. I am very confident I can write and piece together a story from interviews, games, and clips from his personal to tell a worthy story of the transcendent figure Kobe is. I would love to do this, with the help of you! I am not asking for financial donations, or anything close to that. In fact, I have no problem with taking on the majority of the work load considering this is my idea. If you would like to pitch in to this project, this is what I am looking for

\- Someone to narrate and read the script I am writing. The requirements for this is that you own a decent quality mic (Blue Snowball, Blue Yeti, Fifine, Audio Technica anything along those lines). I will do the cleaning up of the audio in Adobe Audition

\- Anyone that wants to help research, help with the script writing, proof reading, make sure no important stories or context is left out

\- Anyone with editing experience whether it is visual or sound that would like to help out or guide the project, because this is a very very big project

The goal is to give as much context and information about the amazing life of Kobe Bryant in a way that anyone can enjoy, familiar with him or not. I would like to be near completion by around the end of the playoffs. I am aiming for around an hour to an hour and a half long video that will be uploaded to Youtube, and of course, \*\*NEVER\*\* monetized.

I have made a few post about this on [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA/) and have gotten a few people interested in narration, but I've realized having more hands on deck would be amazing. I'm not Kobe, I probably cannot do this by myself. If I get enough people interested whether it be helping research or edit, or give advice, I could make a discord server for us to communicate in. If anyone here is experienced with the production of documentaries you can most likely tell I have little idea what I am doing, but I really want to do this. Even if this doesn't get a ton of traction/support I want to do this to honor my hero.",1580292342.0

I was not very much into basketball prior to 2015, and although I knew of Kobe's talent and greatness, it never impacted me the way it impacted so many others. Still, I've been brought to tears multiple times since the news broke, and it took until today for me to finally make sense of it and put it into words. Apologies in advance: a bunch of this is not basketball related per se. I posted the following text on twitter and facebook regarding my relationship with my own father, who has been a formative influence on my life:

Kobe Bryant's love of being a #girldad reminds me of the special bond between my father and I. That's probably why his death is hitting me so hard; I think of that bond and what my bond with my father means to me.

Just as Kobe introduced his girls to what he loved, my dad did the same. Dad found music starting in the 60s that piqued his interest from the album art alone, as he browsed vinyls at Tower Records, that went on to be legends—Led Zeppelin, Dire Straits, The Velvet Underground, Judas Priest—just to name a few. Dad fostered my love of heavy metal too, taking me to see Iron Maiden at age 16, Van Halen at 17, and Judas Priest at 21.

At 8 years old Dad sat me down to watch his favorite movie: 2001 A Space Odyssey. It’s come to become one of my favorites too. A few years ago we got the chance to see it on the big screen with the NY Philharmonic playing the music live. I’ll never forget experiencing that with the man who started it all for me.

At age 10 he showed what has become my favorite film of all time: Sunset Blvd. Later that year he showed me The Shining, which piqued my interest in horror films. Horror is now a treasured genre for me, and Dad and I always jump at the chance to see a good one in theaters together. He’s the one who found The Babadook before anyone else, after all. He told me, with palpable excitement on his face, that he’d found an indie Australian horror movie by a female director that we HAD to see. So we went to the limited release in December 2014 and saw a masterwork together. As ever, I take pride in telling people “My dad knew about it before anyone else did.”

My love of horror blossomed into a love of filmmaking as a craft, which pushed me to eventually pursue a degree in Film in college. It remains my first love.

There are very few moments more precious than sitting together and appreciating a classic film together. One night a few years ago Dad acquired a Kino print of The Cabinet of Dr Calagari with the original color tinting. He just wanted to briefly look at it, but I walked in and 20 minutes later we were both standing there, mesmerized, discussing how masterful it was, even though we’d both seen it many times before. My favorite moments are the ones where we sit together watching a film noir, and one shot has such beautiful cinematography—such great lighting and composition— that we both have the same visceral, vocal reaction to it.

I know this isn’t about Kobe per se, but it gets to the heart of why his death has impacted me the way it has, even though I never followed him and his career as closely as others have. Beyond basketball, Kobe was a father passing on his love on to his daughter, encouraging & supporting it. It was obvious he loved having daughters, and it reminds me of just how special it is to have a strong bond between a father and a daughter. I am grateful every day of my life to have such a special, supportive man (with VERY good taste in movies and music) in my life.

This brings me back to basketball. My dad was watching a Golden State Warriors game one night in 2015 when I, who at that point had absolutely no interest in sports, saw Steph Curry hit a deep three and became immediately enthralled. I’d never seen shooting like that before! From then on, my dad, who doesn’t have much loyalty to teams one way or the other (he just loves the game), became a GSW fan along with me. We’ve been to two live games together since then, and he bought me my very first basketball shirt as a surprise in late 2015 (a replica Curry jersey). 

Thank you Dad. I'm so proud to be your daughter.

(I posted that on facebook 2 hours ago. Dad called me from work a few minutes ago (he's a pediatrician who commutes from Florida to New York three days every week) when he saw my post, to talk. We reflected on our bond, and I felt that in this time of mourning,  I should share this. To those of you who have daughters: support them the best you can. I promise you, they will remember it and cherish it forever.)",1580290726.0

You were DIFFERENT! Sometimes we competed so hard against each other that you could never tell how I was always watching YOU!! I needed to see how much better I needed to get and how much harder I needed to work! The love you had for the game was nowhere near the love you had for YOUR girls!! All 5 of them!! And Gigi, who we had already prearranged her marriage with lil Chris, is as beautiful and feisty as she could ever be!!! As I’ve watched you in retirement, as happy as you’ve ever been, I’ve sat back and prayed and hoped that my baby girl will look at me the way Gigi looks at you!!!

I'm the guy in the white jersey in this picture, and it took me two days to process what has happened.

Hi kid, I was saying... To me you will forever be that nice kid at the Piattelli Trophy in Montecatini Terme in 1989: a scrawny kid with the longest legs, with lively eyes and a smile that would have, later, charmed not only basketball but the world as a whole. 

A kid that one night, thirthy years ago, did something unique and unrepeatable: step on the court alongside your father ""Billy Joe"", with the ""grown-ups"" during the Finals of a summer tournament, with his jersey down to his knees and the shamelessness of Champions, even if you were only eleven. You tried to leave a mark on the game, to be a protagonist and not just an extra, like you would have done later and for the rest of your career.

The Finals of a summer tournament, probably one of the most important tournaments at the time, played in Montecatini during the best years of basketball in Tuscany; on the court there were only adult players, from Serie A, Serie B, Serie C and Serie D; from Montecatini, Pistoia, Livorno, Siena and Florence: nobody wanted to lose, it was serious business...

Matters of local rivalries and honor, ""italian suburbs"" stuff, but feelings and emotions that you would have brought, with your immense talent, to basketball overseas. 

""A kid on the court, how cute!"", was the thought of the 1,000 people on the stands, among them your mother, that looks at you, entranced. 


""A kid on the court, what a bore!"", the athletes thought. 

""What am I supposed to do now?"", the thought of the man that had to guard you. 

And that man, for better or for worse, was me, a mediocre player from the lower Tuscan divisions. 

The kid catches the ball... And I tell myself ""don't move, don't do anything... It's a kid!""

The kid shoots from 3... Nothing but net, the crowd goes wild, my teammates show signs of disapproval.

On the next play, the kid gets the ball again... I think ""get closer, but don't raise your arms... It's a kid!""

The kid, careless, shoots again from 3... and he scores again! The crowd shouts again, my mates grumble again, my coach that didn't want to lose (nobody did) calls a timeout and demands me to defend. 


We get back on the court. 


Again the kid has the ball.

The whole arena wants the kid to shoot. And cheers him. 

All my teammates want me to defend. And shout ""don't let him shoot!""

""F- me"" I think ""what should I do now?""

I get closer to the kid and with my eyes I try to tell him ""don't do it, please""

No chance, he's got only sheer determination in his eyes (was the mamba mentality already there?)

The crowd is out of their minds: shoot! Shoot again!

I raise my arms without even looking at the kid.

As reckless as before, he takes the ball, bigger and heavier than him, and shoots it.

Unintentionally and inevitably, I block the shot: what's his mother going to think about me?


The arena screams disappointed at me, my mates keep on playing like nothing ever happened...

I start laughing facing this tragicomical situation and tell the coach ""either you bench me now or you're coming here and guard this kid!""

Right... The kid... That kid, that in a few years would have given to basketball so many emotions that nobody could ever imagine, including the best love letter, the best farewell that anyone has written. 


Goodbye kid...


Now you'll make angels fall in love with basketball: every basket a divine ""plan""!

Maybe one day we'll play again 1 on 1, and, without any doubt, you'll give me back that ridiculous block, while your daughter will watch us and laugh. 


5...4...3...2...1...


Farewell, Kobe. It has been beautiful.

>The cause of the crash remains under investigation, but dense fog at the time was such that the Los Angeles Police Department and the county sheriff's department grounded their helicopters.

>Justin Green, an aviation attorney in New York who flew helicopters in the Marine Corps, believes weather may have contributed to the crash. Pilots can become disoriented in bad weather, losing track of which direction is up. Green said a pilot flying an S-76 would be instrument-rated, meaning they could fly the helicopter without relying on visual cues from outside.

>Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said his department's choppers would not have left their airport in Long Beach in such weather conditions.

> ""it's my responsibilty to put this s**t on my back and keep it going""

LeBron already has so much weight on his shoulders, so many high expectations to meet. He came into the league as a teenager expected to become the next face of the NBA, he did it, and today, at 35, he's still expected to be the best player on the court every game. He's expected to be a perfect role model, a successful businessman and at the same time a voice for progress and a force for change.

He already has so much weight on his shoulders, and that he decides to put it all on him again is so sad but also so brave.

LeBron doesn't owe anybody anything. He didn't owe us an Instagram post. He didn't have to publicy share his feelings, his grief, his cries. Yet he did.

We are witnessing greatness here, I could never understand and never will understand the hate that LeBron gets, but as many have said let's be grateful for every single moment that we get of him until his retirement.",1580287516.0

Here are the possible dates:

Feb 20th. The day after the all-star break meaning both teams are rested. It would be the first game of a back to back for the Lakers with them playing the Grizzlies at home the next day. 

April 10th. This would be the second game of a back to back for the Lakers having played the Warriors at home the day before. For the Clippers this would be the first game of a back to back playing the Warriors at home the next day. 

After April 15th (current end of the regular season). Both teams play away on April 15th. IMO it’d be great way to end the season to have these teams face off on a day when only they would be playing. It could be a very special day.",1580286007.0

254,rewatching an old podcast from gilbert arenas made me think about one of the aspects of kobe's career that I think sometimes goes underappreciated.,4,eve39g,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eve39g/rewatching_an_old_podcast_from_gilbert_arenas/,31,"https://youtu.be/tlykQVddNNQ?t=3760


basically gilbert arenas was talking about how kobe was a relatively average nba athlete for his size, with a vertical of 38 inches; and how impressive it was that he still managed to be in the conversation for the greatest player with michael jordan, who was one of the most gifted athletes of all time at 6'6 with a 46 inch vertical.  I think it really speaks to the work ethic and determination of kobe bryant.


the full segment on kobe and jordan starts at about 57:10 in the video and stems from a discussion on how kawhi leonard impresses gilbert arenas in a similar way which starts at about 49:05.",1580284034.0

He leads in assists and steals by a wide margin.

I hear people discuss whether or not kareems scoring record will be broken, but to me it seems even less likely that someone will rack up that many assists.

I thought maybe Chris Paul or LeBron might be on track but they are several thousand assist short. Westbrook is younger than them and maybe still has time, but I would be pretty shocked.

Is it because he never won a championship?",1580283673.0

It was at least 10 minutes long and featured a clips of the whole range of Kobe’s game from dunks ,to insane layups in traffic, to him going crazy on one on one defence, impossible fade-aways etc 

I’m pretty devastated about Kobe’s death and it’d mean a lot to me to watch it again, and this is from a Celtics fan who got into the game during the 2008 championship team and saw him lead the Lakers in that brutal finals in 2010. If you happen to remember the video please link it to me

However, for this post, I want to focus on the back court of the Houston Rockets, and the incredible volume of shots the duo of James Harden and Russell Westbrook take on a per game basis.  Below, I have compiled a list of the highest volume shooting teammates from each of the last 50 NBA seasons, and also included the percentage of the team’s shot attempts that each set of teammates accounts for on a per game basis.

As you will see, Harden and Westbrook’s combined **45.7 FGA/Game** are the second highest mark in the last 50 years, and this also accounts for **50.4% of the team’s FGA on a per game basis** which is the 3rd highest rate of the last 50 NBA season.

I don't know all the answers,but we should see more interviews of people like Duncan,KG,Shaq,etc. 

 Seeing stuff like the sit down interview between Shaq and Kobe was great,and I'm glad we have that footage. It'd be awesome to see legends ""talk out"" major games,events,and their lives.

296,"Despite Starting the ASG, Trae Young is Underrated",0,evbp5i,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/evbp5i/despite_starting_the_asg_trae_young_is_underrated/,41,"\*Trae is putting up 30.5 PPG / 9.3 APG / 4.8 RPG on 59.6% TS% w/ 45/38/84% shooting splits. 

For context, only 4 players in the history of the NBA have ever put up >25 PPG, >8 APG on a TS% of at least 59%

* Lebron 4x (in argument for GOAT)
* Jordan 1x (considered the GOAT)
* Harden 2x (considered by some to be the best offensive player ever)
* Trae currently (considered by many to be an empty stats player and shouldn't be an all star)

Meanwhile, people consider Luka a top 5 player and MVP candidate despite a similar counting stat line but on percentages of 46%/32%/76% (TS% of 58.9%). Trae pretty much sweeps him across the board despite 1) having a significantly worse team and coach, 2) the second best player on the Hawks missing 25 games this season, and 3) despite seeing the most double-teams off PNR in the NBA by a significant margin (189 through Jan 20 vs 115 for Luka). Also, he's doing all this at 6' 1"" which typically requires more skill than it does for a 6' 7"" wing. I think a real argument can be made that Luka is overrated (still an elite player) and that Trae is underrated. 

I know he sucks at defense and will never be a good defender, but if Brad Stevens can hide IT and win games, and GSW can hide Curry and win games, there is no reason you can't do the same with Trae. It takes time to build around a player...winning doesn't happen overnight for young teams (even KD's Thunder and Steph's Warriors sucked until they got the right complementary pieces and coaching).

Also as many OKC fans can attest to, Russell Westbrook stopped playing defense in 2014 and became one of the laziest/worst defenders in the NBA...yet his teams won when he had other good players. 

\*Trae left 2 games this season in the first half and didn't return due to ankle injuries. I omitted those from his reported averages given they were not representative of full game stat lines.",1580274716.0

308,Why Does Kobe Bryant's Death Mean So Much To Us?,0,evan35,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/evan35/why_does_kobe_bryants_death_mean_so_much_to_us/,52,"My friend condescendingly began texting me about how he couldn't use social media anymore because everyone was posting about Kobe. He said why does anyone even care about ""guy who shoot ball in hoop"" dying? To me, that was incredibly insensitive, and hurt me. That made me wonder.. why do I care so much about a guy I've never met, and wasn't even that big of a follower of?

&#x200B;

Apart from Kobe being at the top of his game throughout my childhood, Kobe was something special to me. Someone special to everyone who watched him play. I never *thoroughly* liked Kobe for a multitude of reasons, including his rather large ego about how great he was on the court, and how he made sure everyone knew it, my fanhood of one of his rivals during his prime in the Denver Nuggets, his tendencies to put himself before his teammates, whether it was publicly humiliating Dwight Howard, and shooting the ball too much.

But through all of that disdain, Kobe was a figure that represented greatness to me. You knew if you were to tune into one of his interviews, or games, something special was in the works. Through his five titles throughout the course of the early century, all with the same team, within the most established, and historically decorated franchise in the NBA, representing the second largest city in the greatest Country in the World, Kobe elevated himself to a status of elite.

Everyone respected Kobe. He didn’t let you not. Kobe stood for determination, dedication, an insatiable will to win, a passion for greatness, a carrier of the torch to show the world that if they wanted to be considered a great, they would have to go through him. He elevated everyone else around him through his grit, ferocity, and confidence. 

So why does Kobe Bryant’s death mean so much to me?

Basketball means a lot to me. And the NBA is what showcases, and makes the NBA a cultural, and social phenomena. The NBA, and the game of basketball lost one of its main characters in its historic legacy. Potentially the 3rd greatest player to ever play the game. And definitely the most passionate, determined, dedicated, will to win players we will ever see. Kobe inspired the masses to play with the same heart he did. Myself included. And for those reasons, aside from Kobe being the greatest when I first discovered the game, made me eternally see the epitome of what a legend he was, and always will be. 

**I'm making a YouTube video in attempt to memorialize, and honor the sensational life, and career Kobe was and had.**

**I'd like to get some perspective other than my own, so I'm not speaking for myself, with my own experiences and pre-conceived biases. I'd like to hear especially from the fans who consider themselves Lakers fans, and Kobe fans.**

**What made Kobe so likable? Why was Kobe such a legendary figure before his prime had even ended? What was the draw to Kobe that made his fans the most loyal, compassionate, and defensive for who he was as a person, and of his legacy? Was it his determination for greatness?

It also might come off as If I’m trying to bring up something negative in order to stir up controversy, and I really hope that’s not the case. 


 If you have friends like I do, a lot of the conversation about Kobe on your Facebook or twitter or whatever feed may have shifted to talking about his sexual assault trial. I’m someone who has argued that Kobe was guilty for like a decade. I became a clippers fan partially because I couldn’t accept how quickly he was forgiven by the city around me. It was gross to me. (Also because I watched Corey maggette put his testicles on a mans forehead when I was 9 and thought “this is the peak of basketball!” But that’s irrelevant)


But I saw a post yesterday that was just “RIP Kobe Bryant, you influenced a lot of people” and the top response was just simply a link to the Wikipedia page for his trial. And that pissed me off. I’ve worked with a lot of survivors of assault in my life, my mother and sister are both survivors. But this isn’t an attempt to have a conversation, that’s an attempt to shit on people for being sad about a tragedy. Whether Kobe did it or not, you don’t need to forgive him to acknowledge his positive impact on people. You really just need to open your eyes for a bit in this city(probably elsewhere too, I’ve only been in LA since it happened). He wasn’t just an athlete, he was a positive role model to a lot of people who needed one.  I can discuss Kobe’s guilt at length, but if your response to 9 people, including two 13 year old girls dying is to paint all of them with the broad brush of Kobe’s trial, then you shouldn’t be taken seriously. You are using serious issues just to shit on people’s sadness. And that’s all you’re doing.


He influenced people positively. That should be abundantly clear. If you want to have a discussion then do that. But don’t dismiss people’s sadness over something that’s...sad.

Ricky Rubio is averaging 13PPG, 4.6 RPG, and 8.8 APG, along with 1.4 SPG and .2 BPG.

It’s crazy to think about how much of an upgrade the Jazz thought they were getting once acquiring Conley. They were actively trying to trade Rubio the entire season until the trade deadline. Once even proposing a 3 team deal that would have Conley go to Toronto and Lowry come to Utah.

Once the trade actually went down in the offseason, the Jazz were immediately considered title contenders and immensely better now with Conley. Remember this was before Bogdanović and Mudiay signed as well.

Now, the Conley trade may go down as one of the worst trades in Jazz history. Rubio is having a much better season than him, and to tell you the truth, this current Jazz team would be much better with Rubio instead of Conley.

The acquisition of Conley *alone* was said to make the Jazz a true contender. He can’t even match Ricky Rubio’s stats. He is also our highest paid player at 30M a year, double what we paid Rubio.

If this trade didn’t happen, the Jazz would still have Derrick Favors as their backup center, and Ricky Rubio with the crazy chemistry he had been developing with Gobert and Mitchell for 2 years. Not to mention Jae Crowder and Kyle Korver. Along with the new additions of Bogdanović and Mudiay.

I’m sad.

Edit: Ricky Rubio also averaged more than Conley last year with the Jazz.

Never seen anyone with your desire to win and get better every day. Fucking unreal.",1580261595.0

Kobe wasn’t actually too inefficient, as his career true shooting being at an average at the 55% suggests, and he was also a willing passer- just not late in games and who can blame him. 

His 3-point shooting was always a tad overrated, Kobe was more of a shot-maker than a pure shooter. People still to this day say that Kobe was a better three-point shooter than LeBron, despite Bron’ taking and making more. 

His defense was elite early in his career but he really stopped being all-defense quality after Shaq left and he had to take on more of an offensive load, still was a monster on that end during the playoffs. 

Oh and Kobe was a brilliant off-ball player, it’s the least talked about part of his game and yet arguably what allowed him to be so consistently great. We all know he could post you up and hit a fader, but it was his constant darting off of screens and hitting jumpers on the move that laid the groundwork for players like Curry to do the same, only just a little further back.",1580258558.0

Kobe generated loud debates about strategy and efficiency, but for most people who consumed the game, all of that missed the point.

However, I really know nothing about the sport or what to expect when we get there, so I wanted to ask a few questions to make sure we have the best experience possible:

* I haven't bought any tickets yet since I'm still waiting for approval for the time off from work. Which seats can we get without breaking the bank? Are there any sort of deadlines where availability of tickets goes down, or price goes up?

* Are there any logistics things we should know ahead of time? I'm planning on getting us to the stadium about an hour early, will that give us enough time to get concessions and find our seats?

* Is there anything else we can do to enhance the experience? I'm guessing he'd want autographs (especially James Harden) but is that even something that the away team does?

* Any other advice for keeping costs down? We're living in Nashville so we'll likely be getting a hotel that night so I don't have to drive for the five hours after the game. Are there any sort of hotel and ticket packages, or any sort of cheaper alternative accomodations?

I really appreciate any advice. Going to see an NBA game is the one thing he keeps asking to do and I'm really glad for the opportunity to see his favorite team.",1580257604.0

Last night's Kings comeback reminded me of the sheer absurdity this game produces sometimes. 0-8378 with that lead and so little time. It didn't seem possible and yet it did happen. Here's another, remember that Pelicans' loss to the Suns in OT last year because New Orleans couldn't figure out how to call timeouts? (Note: Great coaching by Gentry to not throw the team under the bus.) That loss put them in a three way tiebreaker in the lottery with Memphis and Dallas and there's no way New Orleans wins #1 for Zion if they win that game. Who know how the rest of the lottery plays out? Do the Lakers still move up to 4?

I guess what I'm trying to say TWolves' fans, I think this is the year you finally move up in the lottery. 42.1% to move into the top 4 right now. Take heart and buy KAT jerseys.

Interesting, but understandable choice. Although I wonder if he asked Vanessa if she wanted to see it first?

Either way, just another aspect of how great and talented Kobe was (still doesn't feel right to say in past tense) and how with the mamba mentality, you can achieve anything you set your mind to.

He leave the basketball as soon as he retires, to focus on the other thing, because thats Kobe fucking Bryant. He either gives 100% or not at all.

The reason he came back to watch the NBA again was bcs his daughter, He was leaving the NBA, never been to the lakers game after his retirement (mb 1 or 2). And then his daughter came, told him that she wants to ball, thats why he bring her to the lakers game, teach her all the things about basketball, I believe even the MambaAcademy was for her.

Its been almost 48 hours since I hear the news, and I still feel so sick. I want to cry but I cant, and hell thats the worst feeling ever. But im sure thats not how kobe feel, Im sure hes smiling up there, because theres no other satisfaction than giving all you can to your family.

I watched the Rockets nearly every night with my dad with the classic Bill and Calvin Murphy duo. But eventually I fell out and stopped watching as a teenager.

Baseball is the sport I've taken a love the most as an adult. I fell in love with it in college when I went to spring training games.

When I watch basketball now I get depressed that I don't find it engaging as I used to. This was the same person that went to basketball camp, was obsessed with NBA Jam, wore my jerseys everywhere. I feel out of the loop when I watch now and I don't find it fun to watch anymore. But the day Kobe died I was taken aback like everyone else. I watched Dear Basketball and was moved by his love for the sport and it rekindled old memories of loving basketball myself. I was hoping if the ladies and gentlemen of r/nba could help me reignite my love for my old sport. 

Things I struggle with while watching: 

- the constant fouling (I hated this even as a kid)

- time outs (4th quarters are miserable for me)

- constant commercial breaks (see above)

- I don't know how to break the game down and watch anymore

- I find myself bored by the high scoring. I really love low scoring sports like baseball, soccer, and (usually) football. In basketball so many points happen and it often feels like points matter. Maybe this criticism isn't true.

- I dislike the star power focus. Don't get me wrong, as every sport has stars, but it feels like since the 90's it has become more star focused rather than team focused which has spurred super teams. It feels like basketball fans, more than most other sports fans, argue who the GOAT is. In baseball, a hitter is great but nothing without a good defense. In baseball you might sacrifice yourself so your teammate can get on base so you can eventually score runs. It's truly a team sport. Same in football. But it feels like basketball puts emphasis less on the team which turns me off. It feels like the only sport where ball hogging is a viable tactic.

- there's something about the flow of play that turns me off while watching that makes many games predictable (see the 4th quarter complaints).

I apologize if I offended anyone with my criticism. It isn't my aim to shit on basketball or the NBA.

I would love for some people to sit down and give me some points of reference so I can enjoy the sport again. 

Shout out to the LA fans going through such a hard time right now. One love from Houston.",1580241415.0

But being such a fan and trying to give thoughts and opinions on a male dominated league has always felt difficult. Not because of any of you, but because I naturally feel like I’m not as smart or as qualified as the men on here who have insight. Kobe changed that for me. The way he loved women, the way he respected his daughters, the way he constantly reminded everyone he didn’t need a son to continue his legacy. I can’t play basketball to save my life, but I never really felt like I could talk about it the same way men could. He changed that for me. He reminded me women matter just as much as men. He truly made me feel like I could love this sport just as equally with zero doubts. His death is so tragic to me. He made me want to further my career with sports and never doubt myself just because I was a girl. He was a proud dad of girls and it made me feel proud. He was such a beautiful soul and I will always remember him for making me feel like women matter. To the legend, thank you. I love you, and you changed my perspective forever. Mamba forever. Rest in power. 


Edit: because someone said I don’t know about Colorado, I do, here is my response 
: I do. I do a lot. I’ve read about the case countless times. The case that happened and what happened I’ll never know the full truth. What I do know is Kobe respected women a shit ton and has been a massive advocate for the WNBA and for women’s college basketball. I’m an Oregon grad and his friendship with Sabrina was beautiful and how he inspired her and my team to be better. I don’t know what happened there and I’ll never know, but I’ll always know how much he advocated for women in sports. That’s what I’m choosing to remember and be thankful for.",1580228781.0

I understand that the players are all wealthy, making millions to play a game and entertain- however I can not help but be very concerned for the state of the league and it’s players right now, we are all human and that is not an option..

I want to think that each player will embrace the Mambamentality and each player scores 60 points a night, but the reality is that the passing of such a larger than life figure (in the prime of his life) more will be affected negatively than not.

I have seen what this type of loss and tragedy can do to an individual if left unchecked and it is never a pretty sight.  I tried contacting the 76ers... how do you reach out and contact a professional sports team?!?  I called every number I could find hoping to reach someone- anyone, to see if there is something, anything I can do to help...

I feel helpless while many out there are in pain...I feel so small.

Please NBA- have a system for your employees to help with this, get a beat on the pulse of your teams, on a team by team basis, player by player basis, staff member by staff member basis... do not slouch on this.. please...

As for us folk around these parts- the people I can reach...grieving is a normal process- however if it draws out, becomes prolonged, if you are unable to sleep, eat, if your friends and family are telling you about a change in your mood or demeanor, quick to anger, please reach out to someone and seek help.

426,"Kobe Bryant's memory should be honoured, and that is best done by not retiring his number(s).",0,ev2h3z,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ev2h3z/kobe_bryants_memory_should_be_honoured_and_that/,17,"These are simply the thoughts of /u/CatharticEcstasy.

The past days have been terrible. Kobe Bryant is still gone. It feels like a nightmare, or a simulation gone wrong, but I'm not waking up no matter how hard I pinch myself. I've read so many threads, almost wallowing and miring myself in the tragedy to the point of toxicity.

But in the midst of it all, it's important not to make rash decisions. I've read wild suggestions that Gianna should have her #2 Mamacita jersey retired in the Staples Center alongside Kobe's #8 and #24, and saw that opinion showered with upvotes. Give grief the proper time to process. In our most despondent states, we rarely come up with our most proudest moments. But on this topic of jersey retirements, let's not cloud our heads with sorrow and make definitive actions based upon it.

It feels improbable, nigh impossible, but there is a boy out there who will surpass Kobe Bryant one day. He might be in the league right now, he might be drafted this year, or maybe still he is yet to be born. The beauty of sport is its reflection of life - its roaring highs, despondent lows, encapsulated by its fleeting moments all the same.

Kobe Bryant himself was once that boy. He threw *everything* he had and more at the game of basketball, and he came out wiser, stronger, and a better man. He sought to emulate MJ, modelled his game after him, and crafted his body in the gym and his mind through tape to fulfil his ambition. He relished the struggle and the overcoming of obstacles. 

But of all challenges he took head-on, he never picked up gatekeeping. 

He was about open doors and opening doors - he supported women in sport, within and without basketball. He celebrated LeBron's achievement in personally surpassing his point total. Kobe was able to find joy not only in the fulfilment of his own dream(s), but also to find fulfilment in the completion of others.

If we retire his jersey(s) today, tomorrow, or in future to *honour Kobe*, we miss that salient point. To retire a jersey is to close a chapter, close the gates, and nail it shut. Retiring a jersey ends a boyhood dream.

While I very much want to wake up from this nightmare, I don't want that dream to die. I'm sure Kobe would not either.",1580226232.0
427,I can’t look at pictures of Kobe’s daughter without breaking down,33,ev2gzp,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ev2gzp/i_cant_look_at_pictures_of_kobes_daughter_without/,28,"For some reason I can cope with seeing Pictures of Kobe much more than seeing anything regarding his daughter. She seemed so happy, so loved, so full of life...they really did share a special bond... and them dying together is just too heartbreaking for me. You can get over losing a lover/soul mate more than losing a child. 

Like I wish I could have stop them all from going into that helicopter or simply be there somehow to tell them
“There’s too much fog, let’s just get there through a vehicle”... or that the pilot simply told Kobe “the weather is terrible... I know we’re not gonna make it in time but I’m not willing to take that risk even if it angers you” or maybe his daughter not be there because she was feeling sick or something. Or maybe Gigi not even like basketball at all and prevents this situation. I don’t know... my brain just comes up with a lot of possibilities that simply could have prevented this.

I don’t even want to imagine what her mom must be going thru... because guilt is a bitch. I’m feeling it and I’m just some random person on the internet. 

I’m a very logical and rational person for the most part but riding planes just scare the hell out of me... and imagining those kids scared because the Helicopter is free falling or something similar is too much for me. 

I made the dumb mistake of going to her Instagram and I couldn’t stop crying just looking at her captions and just her lust for life and passion for basketball. 

This is the second night in a row I cry before going to bed and I feel like a bitch. I honestly don’t remember the last time I cried in the last decade. Just gives me a preview of the mess I will be when I eventually lose my mother/father/family member... 

I’m the oldest of three and I’m fine dying first... I don’t want to see any of my younger sisters dying before me... at the same time I wouldn’t want to die before my mother because I know she wouldn’t be able to handle it. 

This situation has shake me to my very core.",1580226208.0

As you might have heard, Kobe Bryant, his daughter and 7 others tragically passed this morning in a helicopter crash devastating the NBA community.

I remember the first game I ever watched was the 2010 finals game 7 between the lakers and the Celtics and watching Bryant lift that Finals MVP trophy and that was the game that got me to love the sport of basketball. My favorite mamba moment would have to be his final game with the lakers. He put his heart and soul into that final game and as a basketball fan, it was the best ending to a players career I had ever seen. He went out in the most Kobe way ever and I had loved every moment of it. I only got a short time to watch this legend and would love to hear your favorite mamba moments or how he affected you guys.

For example, spending 1 or 2 hours each day focusing on the gym to get stronger, or putting in hard work studying to ace a class, and maybe we can all discuss the progress and results after adopting his ""mamba mentality."" What do y'all think?


Edit 1: If you all feel comfortable in doing so, posting updates as edits to your main post would be great.

444,Favorite Kobe Memory (My first live NBA Game Seattle Supersonics Fan),22,ev1j3g,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ev1j3g/favorite_kobe_memory_my_first_live_nba_game/,8,"I remember this like it was yesterday, February 24th 2008. A couple weeks earlier my dad asked me if I wanted to go to my first game to watch Kobe before the SuperSonics left Seattle.

I grew up in a military family 40 min south of Seattle. My dad had just retired from the military. Previously he was only home a couple months a year, looking back I would unfortunately say that he was pretty absent from my childhood.

This is before FaceTime and available Wifi, so you had to satellite call in and each soldier only had 10 minutes to talk so everyone could speak with their families.  I remember I would talk to him over the phone when he was deployed in Iraq or overseas in South Korea, the one connection we had was basketball. No matter where in the world he was, or what horrific event was going on, the one thing we would talk about was Basketball.

We just lost Rashard Lewis and Ray Allen to free agency but drafted this wonder kid Kevin Durant. ""Did you see Durant? He is going to be pretty good!"" He was a lifelong Knicks fan so he would say that being in Iraq was better than watching them play.

We packed the whole family up and go to the game. 99% of the crowd are Lakers fans. We were at an away game in our own stadium. I was a wide-eyed, squeaky voiced 13 year old enjoying every moment. My first basketball game, I got to see Kobe Bryant and our new guy Kevin Durant. Kobe starts the first quarter off blazing and gets fouled. I will never forget the entire stadium starting chanting MVP, MVP!

Second quarter comes and the game is pretty straight forward, every time the Lakers score the crowd goes crazy. Anytime Seattle scores a few claps. Halftime.

Then the third quarter starts and here come the fireworks. We are getting destroyed, down by 31... Kobe starts arguing with the ref about a foul call. (*Only Kobe is going to yell about a foul call when he's up 31.*) Walks all the way down court arguing, turns around and gets T'd up. **The crowd starts to rumble.** Seconds go by and he walks back towards the ref with Derek Fisher holding him and gets T'd up again. To this day, I have never in my life heard a crowd explode the way they did.

Boos from Laker Fans who paid to see their hero. Cheers from Seattle fans trying to numb the ultimate fate of the franchise. For the rest of the game we had to watch Earl Watson and Luke Ridnour pretend to play basketball.

While this game wasn't anything too special, I will never forget my first NBA game and the emotion the crowd had for him. He was like superman to the entire stadium.

The past 24 hours I've felt numb, a shell of myself. I went to work today and just ignored the world.  I've read the words 'Kobe Bryant is dead' 100 times but it still doesn't mean anything. I see the words, I understand what they mean but its not connecting. I've never had to deal with death before, so I just feel a void. No emotion, no reaction, nothing. I feel guilty because I don't know if I'll ever feel anything.

What I do know is that for the rest of my life I will remember my first NBA game, I smiled today thinking back to that moment. The Lakers hero and our new rookie going head to head. I know its ironic but

*The Lakers beat the Supersonics. What can I say, today was a good day. <3*",1580220125.0

I've been so blessed in my life because I never lost someone truly truly important to me.  I've lost loved ones but I was either A) never THAT close to them or B) they suffered for a long time and the prognosis was grim.

The amount of guilt a man could feel for not avenging a lost friend or loved one, or not doing justice by them. That's not something to stamp in someone's mind.

I am not a Lakers fan, and I am not very old and didn’t get to appreciate Kobe in his prime to the full extent, yet, somehow he’s ended up in my memory. And while reflecting, it’s the strangest thing that I can have such a deep idea of who he was as a player and person, but I guess that’s what happens when a man like him comes around. 

I guess everyone takes it in their own time, but in all honesty for the first day and a half since the news broke up, I was just in disbelief. And then, about an hour ago, it felt like my mind suddenly clicked and started allowing me to feel  emotions deeper than sadness over this. And I cried for the first time.

It just blows me away how just in an instant, someone that has always just existed in ones life can be gone. My heart is breaking over him and Gianna, and all of the victims aboard, it’s not fair. Half of my mind is still trying to understand the reality, but it’s difficult to accept anything like this. They both had so much more to do and give, so so so much more. Kobe was 41, Gianna was 13, I cannot begin to conceive what the families are going through.

Appreciate everything you have, is the most positive advice I can gain from this devastation. We all have to be there for one another and not be self centered, life is far too short. 

This likely sounds choppy, or like a repost of others’ experiences, but with the emotions now fully reaching me I needed somewhere to just speak my mind, which I guess would explain the lack of structure in this post.

So, they knew before TMZ reported it. I'm guessing that the LAPD hadn't officially notified them yet. I'm guessing that TMZ found out from someone who leaked it related to those parties.

The past day has been incredibly heartbreaking for me. Kobe is someone that I looked up to and admired and developed a personal relationship with. I have struggled so much with trying to understand the devastating news and like many others I’m still trying to process it.

It has also come to my attention that there is a story going around tonight about an intentional lane violation that I took to ensure Kobe would get his 60th point in his final game and many are applauding me for the gesture. The fact of the matter is that is not true.


That was a night that I will truly never forget as I can remember almost every moment of it and my goal that night was to compete as hard as I possibly could against Kobe because that is what he was all about and I wanted to give him my very best.


He got 60 on me and I didn't give him anything free all night. What happened on the free throw line was not intentional. Kobe would have lost respect for me if I gave him something free. That’s what made him so very special!

Rest In Peace Kobe. I’m so honored to have shared our time on and off the court together!

adjective

providing psychological relief through the open expression of strong emotions; causing catharsis.

That's what this game was. That's what this game thread was.

I know this sub, and Reddit in general, shits on ESPN, and rightfully so, for when they mess up, but they deserve a lot of credit for this.

They didn't have to do this. There was a college basketball game tonight, and the Australian Open.

But this was bigger. Kobe always had a way to find the spotlight.

They showed very few commercials, except the local ones. All they showed was local commercials, and highlights of the tributes of some of the many people who grieve with the rest of us. 

That game thread was one of the beautiful things I've ever been a part of on the internet. (Props to the r/NBA mods as well.) This site, these users laughed, cried, and got emotional seeing our guy go off one more time.

Of course, this was only a replay. There won't be anymore game-winners, no more unstoppable fadeaways. There is still more mourning to do, more emotions to process and go through. But for two hours, on a cold January night, we got to see Kobe light it up on the Worldwide Leader one more time.

RIP Mamba.",1580213387.0

584,An amazing call by JVG regarding one of Kobe's most overlooked skills,142,euxwbi,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/euxwbi/an_amazing_call_by_jvg_regarding_one_of_kobes/,22,"[CHECK OUT THE CLIP FIRST!](https://youtu.be/zanS2bJnm5w)

Wasn't sure if this would be allowed as a link post since it's a random old highlight, and we prolly don't want this place to get flooded.

----

Kobe was consistently impressive in these exact situations, hence JVG's call. He was so much more than a scorer.  Normally, the old sports cliches of ""wanting it more"" and ""knowing what it takes to win"" are bullshit; after all, everyone there's a professional. But in Kobe's case it was often true...he *did* want it more, and he knew what it took, whether it was making a hard cut, boxing a man out, getting a solid post seal. Whatever it was, he was gonna do it as *fundamentally sound* as possible, so as to make it a simple repetition of his practice in the gym, which was the real game for him.

Rest in peace Mamba. You're the reason a lot of us are even here, as strangers bonding over the most beautiful game in the world.",1580201944.0

>""It's going to be hard for another basketball player to view me as I view Kobe,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Kobe was one of the best basketball players to play the game. He was put on this Earth to be one of the best. 

>""When I'm gone, if I can impact people's lives the way Kobe impacted mine and people's lives around the world, that would be a blessing.""   

Kobe was hugely important to Giannis, hence Giannis deleting all his social media profiles after finding out about Kobe's death. He talks about that a little in this article, as well as some general thoughts on the importance of basketball and family.   

All the Giannis quotes: 

>""I grew up with Kobe,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Kobe influenced my life. Looking up to him, one of the reasons I started playing basketball. One of the reasons that I am here today."" 

>""Actually, I'm just trying to keep it private how I feel,"" Antetokounmpo added after practice when asked how he is feeling. ""I feel it's up to me. Everybody deals with tragedy in their own way and I dealt with tragedy a few years ago about my dad. I didn't come out and speak about it all. All I can say is I pray for the people that were affected by it. Yesterday was a horrible day for basketball, for everybody. A lot of people were really affected by it. I send my deepest condolences to their family, Vanessa and the kids that they leave behind. All I can do is pray for them.""

>“At first you’re thinking, like, what I was thinking is that I go out there and hopefully it can make me feel better. It made me feel better when my dad passed away,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""But at the end of the day you think to yourself, is this worth it? Playing basketball for 20 years and then living for 3½ and then being gone, is actually going through all this pressure, all this media, all this, is this actually worth it? Everybody has a different situation. For me, it’s definitely worth it and that’s why I’m going to keep being 100%, whatever I do I’ll do it 100% because without basketball I wouldn’t be here today. It definitely made me feel a little bit better, but obviously, just him not being here and his daughter not being here it’s kind of hard.”  

>“How did Kobe inspire me? Just work hard, be fearless, don’t really care about what people have to say about you, just go out there and do your job, have a smile on your face,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""You’re going to have to sacrifice a lot, a lot of family time, obviously, to play this game, but your family knows why you were put on this Earth, why you play this game, which is to provide for them because that’s what you’re born to do.

>""Kobe means greatness. ... He always had that smile, he always had that charisma that he carried with him. I think it touched a lot of people in the world.""",1580201317.0

There have been mentions of memories they have of him, how sad they are of his passing, and more. One such player is Matt Bonner, who is affectionately known as ""The Red Mamba,"" a nickname that Kobe had given him years back, and has continued to stick ever since.

 Even though he's been retired for over three years, he still gets recognized from time to time and is still referred to by that nickname. However, unlike the past, whenever he gets mentioned by that nickname, a tinge of sadness may ensue thereafter, and I feel for him.

I have some things to say to you.

I grew up in MA,
you played in LA.

You beat my Celtics frequently.
It was awful.

I hated you for it,
but I wanted to be as good as you.

I yelled Kobe at every trash can,
after every fade-away in the driveway.

I played Paul Pierce as you guarded me.
3-2-1, swish! (Or more often, clang).
The crowd goes wild!

I watched your games,
listened on the radio with my dad as you dropped 81.

You were relentless and unapologetic.
You dominated everyone.
You lived on a different plane of existence.

I watched you make mistakes.
You were flawed.
You were complicated.

My Celtics finally beat you.
It felt so good,
but that was because you were so great.

I had learned to respect you.

We almost beat you again.
You weren’t going to let that happen.
You went back to dominating.

You were the best opponent to learn loss from.
You were the best competitor to learn fight from.

Eventually your body betrayed you,
but you accepted it.
You left basketball,
and turned into a different animal,
but the same beast.

You tried new things.
You won an Oscar.
You showed up court side on the Jumbotron,
I was in the nosebleeds.
You were with your daughter.
She clearly loved you.

I watched her highlights,
and watched you coaching.
You seemed so good at it.
She seemed so good at it.

You both showed us all there was more.

•

And then we lost you.

How can you be gone?

You’re Kobe Bryant.
That’s not how this happens.
You’re invincible.

My eyes are closed.

I’m back in the driveway in Massachusetts,
and there you are guarding me again.
Dribble left, crossover back right, 
3-2-1...pull up....

There is no swish, or clang.
There is no victory, or defeat.
There is no crowd cheering.

There is silence.
There is sadness.

I didn’t know you,
but I will miss you.
I didn’t know you,
but you made me better.
I didn’t know you,
but I have nothing but love for you.
I didn’t know you,
but I feel like I did. 

I could never hate you.

Thank you Kobe.",1580200516.0

I’ve always been a bit curious about this trade.  Why would the Blazers make this trade? Clyde Drexler and Tracy Murray for Otis Thorpe and a first round pick.  Drexler goes onto win a ring a few months later with Houston, Thorpe plays 30 games and gets traded again to Detroit. The trade just kind of baffles me looking at it from afar.

Mike Tirico joined for a bit, and as they were talking about Kobe's final career game, during his final free throw to hit 60 points, it looks like Gordon Hayward intentionally stepped into the lane before the free throw, just in case Kobe happened to miss the shot in order to give him another shot at 60. Pretty cool move, shows the respect these guys had for Kobe, and also makes me like Hayward even more. Here is the clip:

Gordon denies it here in a Twitter post after the story made the rounds:

Rest in Peace Kobe Bryant. I still can't wrap my head around this tragedy. Kobe is such a household name in hip-hop, there are literally hundreds of songs that make reference to him. I narrowed the list to 81 songs. I tried to keep it to one song per artist, there are a few exceptions. I know a lot of us are grieving now and I hope listening to these songs will show the cultural impact the icon had. Again, Rest in Peace Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and the seven other people on board. I hope these songs can help somehow.

They would obviously host in the Staples Center or any other capable Los Angeles venue.

It's in the offseason so it would probably be all-star game level in the sense that no one would try to hurt themselves or play defense, but I think having an annual 8/24 game with Kobe's friends, mentors, mentees, and fans would be a cool way to honor his legacy.",1580194416.0

I am willing to do 100% of the research entailing his childhood to death, visual editing and audio cleanup of the voice over.

What I am looking for is someone who is passionate and invested as I am to narrate this. The only requirements is that you have an average quality microphone. (Something like a blue snowball, Yeti, fifine, etc) and would be willing to read the script I send. This would be a well over hour long video and an extensive script. It is something that would be finished well after right now, hopefully towards the end of the season or playoffs.

650,🙏 Kobe shot an awful shot and I got home 🙏,26,euvmcr,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/euvmcr/kobe_shot_an_awful_shot_and_i_got_home/,14,"I'm from Finland. The sorrow of losing Kobe, Gigi and everyone in that accident has really been felt all around the world. Unfortunately we will never get to choose when the lightning strikes. For me it happened in 2008

Basketball is the first true love of my life. When I was a kid my parents figured I could be a swimmer. I hated it. Begged and pleaded for months and finally my dad drove me to the local new basketball gym. After the boredom and depression I felt in the pool ,where every training was same back and forth, basketball was just creative happiness. I fell in love. And I was good. The sweet sound of that perfect swish was my addiction. So for the next 12 years all I did was school and hoops. I'm 6'8 and I played in the Finnish youth national teams and the league. Propably would've gone pro or to collage in the the US.

But I graduated from high school in 2008 and took a celebration trip to Turkey. Everything went well until I woke up the day before our flight back to stomach pain. Hotel called me an ambulance and I went to the local hospital. The doc stuck finger in my stomach and I yelled from pain. The dude went dark and said basically that you have to fight for your life. I had a bad pancreatitis. Basically you're pancreas explodes and the enzymes try to eat you alive from inside. You have to stay awake or you you'll fall to a coma from the pain. 48 hours straight just fighting through that shit. I fought and survived.

But I was in a hospital where no one spoke English except one doctor and I was too fucked up to move. I was in pain all the time. I couldn't drink, eat, move or speak to anyone. All zi had was fucked up thoughts and questions. Everything in TV was dubbed in Turkish so it didn't help as a distraction. Felt like every time I got some sleep the ""call to pray"" loudspeaker next to the hospital woke me up and if not that they woke me up in the middle of the night for surprise blood samples without the ability to comicate what they were about to do. I asked for something to help with my back pain and they brought an urologist. Surprised me when the dude started squeezing my balls. 

Really started to lose hope and my sanity. Until one night I woke up and turned the TV. I flipped through channels. Just the same shit until suddenly boom Mike Breen's voice ""WELCOME TO TD GARDEN AND THE 2008 NBA FINALS"". Holy motherfucking Shit! Instantly forgot all the stuff around me.

Celtics vs Lakers
1) KG showed up and screamed like a mad man. I burst out laughing for the first time in days so I started rooting for Boston
2) Kobe ignored two open teammates and swished a fade away over a double team. If you ever played with a dude that does that...it fckn sucks. So I went full ""Beat LA"" and beat that magnificent asshole beating my team with awful shot selection.
For 2 hours my mind was in a gym with the thing I loved instead of hell and it was everything I needed.

The games happened every two days in the middle of night because of timezone difference. Fighting for something specific is always easier than hoping for something good. So instead of just waiting and hoping for a return home in a situation that was driving me insane. I started fighting just to see the next game. Everytime my mind started spiraling after some horrific moment I reminded myself of Kobe & KG. Of Pierce, Allen and Gasol. It kept me sane. 

I was there for two weeks.

Kobe was there with me and I survived back home.

663,"Dear Kobe,",39,euuxsx,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/euuxsx/dear_kobe/,29,"Dear Kobe,

I never had the desire to meet you as a fan. A fan watches your games, celebrates your victories and moves on from your losses. I dreamed of meeting you as a peer. Not on the basketball court, but as a mamba mentality disciple to his master. 

As a boy I admired your #8, afro-having, posterizing, always stylin’ days. There were basketball players, then there were basketball artists. I consumed and bought into all the Nike, Mcdonalds, and Sprite advertisements, especially the one where you surprise some kids hooping in a park by the water fountain and proceed to host a dunk-off. I fantasized bumping into you at my elementary school water fountain. 

As an adolescent you were an icon that could do no wrong. I became obsessed with basketball. I would spy on my across the street neighbor’s basketball court waiting for him to start shooting around. In the beginning, I’d wait five whole minutes before walking over to ask if I could join him. Soon after, I was knocking on his door after the first shot. As soon as I could consistently make a lay-up I was asking him if I could start the practice session. We watched all your games, and afterwards would run outside to recreate the highlights, switching off who would be ‘Kobe’ taking the shot. You were an icon that could do no wrong, placed high on our pedestals, until you did make a mistake. 

That press conference took a lot of processing for a kid my age. I did not understand why you were crying, why your wife was crying, if you were still going to be able to play. Weeks after I understood the context, I remained confused. What is a role model? Do I watch his games? This is not a tragedy, this is not an accident. This was his action, that has a consequence. I watched your games. Your level of play did not seem altered. Is he innocent? Or, is he just that cold-blooded? Your sponsors backed away. The warm, golden glow around your image turned steel grey. So did my idolization of you. I learned to separate you as a basketball player versus you as a man. Your on-court play was undeniable. It would be inappropriate of me to judge you as a person, but I could no longer see you as my hero. 

As a teen my world morphed in so many ways. Gone were the glory days of the three-peat, gone was Shaq, gone was the triangle, gone was....my innocence, in came insecurities, feeling isolated, and the desire to forge my path in this world. While I spent hours upon hours each day forming my personality, I watched your games. Some of the most lop-sided games, seeing my Lakers play the role of David, but losing to Golitah. The same teams we whipped on, came to town and whooped us. It stung. The world was stinging me, and I was not immune. But, I was ambitious, determined, and content to believe in myself to come out the victor, all while watching your games. How could I outlast all the dilemmas that present themselves when coming of age and going through high school? By watching your games. You showed me a fallen knight does not roll over and die. You showed me how to prioritize first things first. You showed us that the mental leads the physical. You showed me that the key to success is held in your own hand. You showed me giving up is not an option. There are countless plays you’ve made that fans would favorite. But my eyes and ears perked up during your bad games. I waited to see a crack in the steel. I waited to see if you would take the easy way out. But you didn’t. You stayed through ‘ball hog, selfish, arrogant.’ If your basketball story ended here it would be a tragic Greek play. The would-be greatest who lost everything because he could not get along with others. Sixty plus points in three quarters. Nothing. Eighty-One points in a game. Nothing. Three championships. Only with Shaq. Even the playoffs game winner against the Suns, in a series we eventually would lose, would mean nothing if your ball career ended here. I wonder, who values the second half of your career, you, or us?

I remember playing in a soccer game where a teammate of mine said not to pass him the ball in the first five minutes of the game because he was too nervous to make a play. I could not believe that you went through the same thing with Kawme Brown. I was even more shocked, after putting in several hours on NBA Live 2006 on my PSP, which has DWade on the cover, at which I was annoyed buying a face of your rival, I pulled off a trade for Pau Gasol, to then learn the Lakers traded for him in real life. The time for winning was now, and all the fans were excited for the West to welcome back a favored powerhouse. But more importantly, the redemption of Kobe the basketball player was to come. So we watched your games. We saw you face the Spurs and Hornets near the end of the regular season, two wins, including a double pump reverse dunk assisted to you from Lamar Odom who dived on the floor to poke the ball to you. This was not the golden boy wonder #8. But the fiery operator #24 on a mission. 

I got chills watching the Finals TV introduction in 2008. My Lakers versus a Boston superteam. The fans of the game were ablaze with the iconic matchup. The almost adult me hated it. There was no reason for Kobe to be challenged on the court. Let me get a free ring. Let him get a free ring. Rarely do people, let alone world-class athletes, get a chance at redemption, so why risk the chance of them failing? I needed the Lakers to win. I needed Kobe to win. We lost. 

The excitement, hope, and triumph of high school was followed by the absolute soul-crushing hell of community college. Over summer, I stayed in the school library, and I remember reading that we crucially resigned Lamar Odom. Throughout the most bleak academic time in my life, I watched your games. You dislocated your pinky during the MLK game versus Lebron, and that was my excuse for losing against him. But we both know Cleveland had our number in the head to head, match-up wise. The world was set for Kobe versus Lebron when the Celtics had injury problems, but I believe the Lakers were saved when the Magic beat Lebron. There was no way in hell we were going to lose to the Magic. Five games later you were jumping up and down. So was I. While you entered your short postseason, I returned to my life. I was ready to face my challenges. The fans claim to have seen the mamba face for the first time, but the mentality was already imbued in us. 

That was your height for me as a basketball player. During the next years the adage ‘father time is undefeated’ kept coming up during your games. 

This is where the fallen knight, a broken icon, becomes legendary. The championships redeemed your basketball career. The achilles injury redeemed my belief in heroes. Watching, and rewatching your face as you shot those two free throws. Knowing the thoughts running through your mind. Hearing the crowd chant MVP. Seeing Dwight Howard on the court, and feeling the importance of making the playoffs, you stepped up to the line to shoot two. Putting first things first, the mental leads the physical, the key to success in your hands; you knocked down both shots as you likely knew your season and playstyle is over. Can he do it? Will he be the same? No one else has done it...Can I achieve my goals? There is no clear path for me to follow. Doubt. Fear. Process. First things first. The mental leads the physical. I’ve graduated from college entering the next phase of my life. I watched your rehab. I watched your games. You took another knee injury. There are no guarantees.

This time I needed Kobe to win. But the winning was different. I was not naive, I was not insecure, I was not ill-prepared, but I was doubtful. In my own life I had to metaphorically lace up and knock down my shot. I watched your games. There alongside me the whole time, was my hero. He was not made perfect, instead he made himself a success. The day of your last NBA game I expected to be sad. Instead, I was so happy and content. All my ups and downs were a celebration of a life worth living. Your career felt the same way, no need to be sad it is over because the journey we all witnessed made our lives' fuller. 60. Mamba Out. 

I was prepared to say goodbye to my on-court hero. I embraced the redemption of Kobe the person. I learned mistakes and failures do not define you. While everyone tries to tear you down, you do not give up, you do not just endure, you evolve and overcome. If you’re going to be a baker, be the best baker living. Mamba mentality. We all became Mambas. Basketball was simply your medium. I was excited to dive into my medium and become a Mamba. Remember I never dreamed of being your fan, but of someone who garnered your respect as a Mamba in my field. Then you went out and got an Oscar! You were a cross functional Mamba! A different animal but the same beast. I was prepared to say goodbye to my on-court hero, but not my hero and mentor for life. 

I learned from your Muse documentary your family endured the loss of a miscarriage. And I heard your pain and responsibility over the loss. I am so broken by the amount of loss your wife must sustain, now without you or your daughter. She must be blessed with an amazing amount of strength and faith. Your family, and the others affected will always be in our prayers. I did not just lose a basketball legend, a streaking media producer, or my hero. I lost my standard of success. I hope to live my life with the knowledge of everything you’ve taught, the courage you showed me, and determination you instilled in me, and the gratitude you’ve exemplified. Although you are gone, I will never give up on my fantasy to meet you as a student, hoping to make his master proud.",1580190005.0
664,"From a Lakers fan -- Thank you, /r/nba",31,euuxie,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/euuxie/from_a_lakers_fan_thank_you_rnba/,9,"Players in the NBA often talk about how this is a fraternity and brotherhood. They compete and have grudges, but when the dust settles, these guys are a brotherhood. Well, I think we as fans of this sport we cherish so much are also a fraternity of our own.

Seeing all of you guys who are fans from other teams mourn the death of Kobe and offer condolences to the Bryant family, the others who were killed on this tragic helicopter crash, and also us Lakers fans, has been nothing short of genuine and amazing. I know this subreddit has a reputation for the constant bickering and volatile comments, but all of that has stopped. 

I want to thank all of you guys. I never in a million years thought I would have to grieve over the death of a celebrity, yet here I am. Seeing the support and anecdotes from you guys about Kobe has been a tremendous help in this tough time.

665,"To anyone taking this really hard, hopefully this helps a little",24,euuxhv,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/euuxhv/to_anyone_taking_this_really_hard_hopefully_this/,7,"The only thing that's ever brought me any real peace and contentment in my life is meditation. it's helped me with a lot of death in my own life, and to be fully aware and accept what's happening round about me. I couldn't put into words how important a daily meditation routine is for dealing with external and internal factors in life. I meditate around an hour a day now. It doesn't mean I don't feel sad, it just means when I do, I can sit with the feeling and watch it, and then it passes. Positive, negative, good, bad, happyiness, sadness, it's all fleeting sides of the same coin. Meditation opens up an awareness to fully see things as they are. I don't like to tell people my opinions usually, but when something like this happens, the mental walls are down for a lot of people, and change and the way we view things can be looked at and taken on board. I truly believe empathy, compassion, acceptance and love are the only things that matter in life, and meditation opens all those things up. I've seen a lot of people on this board the last day say they want to live more compassionately and not hate players etc, so hope this helps with it. It truly is everything 

I trained to be a counsellor last year, and our lecturer spoke a little bit about death. He said ""The reason death hits so hard, is it has nowhere to go. It's so alien a lot of the time. Most of our life's are on autopilot and when something happens, we know how to react. But with death, it doesn't register straight away"" I really agree with this. Death isn't something to get over, it's something that takes up less space in you as time goes on. The grief becomes less and less, but you never truly get over it, because that phrase in itself doesn't make sense. How can you get over it? You may eventually let go of a lot of the pain that surrounds it, but it's always there 

I'd say I'm quite a spiritual person and I like to live my life that way. In eastern tradition they advise to keep death in your mind everyday, so you can live your life fully. In the west, death is something to be ignored and not spoken about, which is why it hits so hard in my opinion. 

As the recently deceased spiritual teacher Ram Dass said ""If you live in accordance with your soul, then death is just another moment"" and ""Love everything that you aware of, the room, your body, other people. I am loving awareness"" 

During my meditation last night and today, I couldn't stop thinking of Kobe. And it was lovely, I just felt this overwhelming love for him, for everyone 

Again, I'm not trying to shove my ideas down people's throats, not at all. I'm just saying this has something that has been vital for me in my life, and hopefully some other people pick it up and it can help them process things in their life they've never dealt with, or are dealing with. I love basketball and I loved watching Kobe play. I love this community. Take it easy everyone

you were not the first to fall in love with me.

Some burned bright.
Most burned out.

I watched them all come and go.
Because I've seen it all.
Every game.
From peach baskets to the present.
See, I know what greatness looks like.
I know what it takes.
I know it's not for everybody.

Skeptical a kid from Lower Merion could take me places I'd never been.
Skeptical your game could inspire nations and generations.

So I tested you.
From Day 1, I tested you.
I threw everything I had at you.
I wanted to see if Draft Day would destroy you or drive you.
I wanted to see if those airballs in Utah would be a shot to your confidence.
I wanted to see if broken bones and banged up knees and separated shoulders and torn tendons would lessen your love.

They deepened it.

You didn't have to tell me you loved me.
You showed me.
You showed us.

Giannis looked up to Kobe, took his advice as gospel and I highly recommend watching the video in which Giannis describes his workout with Kobe.  Giannis epitomizes the Mamba mentality, his demeanor and approach to the game is Kobe-like.  Kobe challenged him to win MVP.  Giannis did.  Before Kobe had to go, he challenged Giannis to win a championship.  Now he has a chance.  Against Kobe's team.

The PF was Kevin Freeman who was ranked as a top-35 recruit (*[link](https://www.hoopscooponline.com/members/top100classof1996.html)*) and went to UConn where he was named All-West Regional on the way to winning the '99 title. Supposedly Kobe was the PG with Vince & Hamilton as wings, and Tim Thomas was actually the hardest one to guard considering he was 6-ft-10, 240-pounds, and athletic enough he regularly played SF in the NBA, plus was a very good shooter (37% from 3 in NBA), and they won 2 AAU national titles. Most of the specifics come from Freeman, but it should be noted Hamilton is not listed as an alum of the Paterson AAU Team, and in [this 15-second clip of Kobe](https://www.playazbasketball.org/) he mentions playing on a legendary team with ""him"" (*99% sure he's talking about Vince*) and Tim Thomas, but no mention of Hamilton or national championships. I'll also point out that Vince said in an interview yesterday that he's known Kobe since he was 17, which was the summer of '94, and he was off to UNC in '95 so they definitely didn't play together for more than 1 summer.

In [this 2016 interview with Richard Hamilton](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/qa-rip-hamilton-on-kobe-bryant-his-high-school-friend-and-rival/), he talks about him & Kobe both being from Philly suburbs and playing AAU together. He actually talks a lot about them playing AAU together. He doesn't say anything about it being a NJ AAU team (*Paterson is 1.5 hours from Philly, so it wasn't right across the river from Philly or anything*), he doesn't mention Vince Carter or Tim Thomas, he doesn't mention the team being crazy dominant, and he doesn't mention the team winning any national tournaments/titles. Makes me wonder if Kobe was playing on multiple AAU teams since it seems clear that Hamilton was *NOT* on the Paterson AAU Team, or maybe Hamilton was pulled in as a ringer at a big tournament or two. All of these crazy AAU shenanigans were happening then (and for years after), but Hamilton talks about touring around to multiple tournaments with Kobe so this definitely wasn't happening with Paterson.

He told me: “So what if you did that, I missed four (against Utah).” That was an unbelievable piece of motivation. He was a good man and that’s why people felt connected to him. He was literate and smart, while others played games on the phone, he read and studied.”

It goes without saying that Kobe's face, fro, bald head, utterly infectious smile, and equally abrasive sneer have been all over every screen that has passed in front of me for the overwhelming majority of my life. Big, heavy, boxy TV's to clunky computer monitors, to a little 12 inch TV that I played NBA Live 06 on. From my school laptop and now to my fancy computer monitor. Kobe has always been there.

Kobe was not among my favorite players like AI, T-Mac, Dwade, more recently Anthony Davis. I think this was because he was so familiar to me. There was no need to take ownership of him because he had always been there, and idolizing him almost seemed boring at the time. Kinda like idolizing your big brother, or dad. Sometimes you don't think of how great they are because you are so familiar with them.

I'll even go as far as to say that, at some point, this Kobe familiarity bred contempt for me.

But our lives, who we are, and the cultural makeups within us are like a puzzle. Certain people and events each add a piece to this puzzle. Finishing middle school added a piece or two to this puzzle, getting my first ""girlfriend"" added a couple. But some of the puzzle pieces that make us up can sort of slip in there in different spots. I didn't realize how many pieces, scattered here and there throughout my puzzle, had something to do with Kobe Bryant. All the cliche's - tireless work ethic, completeness, self confidence, self worth, motivation, purpose, ..... dreams. Kobe was a validation and manifestation of these things for, I think, my entire generation.

If you were to remove a couple of pieces of this puzzle... or even as much as a 10 piece cluster, you could still connect the dots and make out the bigger picture. But when you remove so many small pieces that were so quietly but confidently scattered throughout, the whole thing just kinda stops making sense. Something so influential can be removed so arbitrarily. I know the pieces will come back, but right now it just feels like they've been taken away, which is why I think we are all struggling to make sense of this. The whole picture is just fuzzy.

Kobe was not perfect, but neither are our puzzles. But goddammit, was he a masterpiece of a human being. Let's keep watching basketball and treating it like it's one of the most important things in the world. It is a powerful vehicle that allows humans like Kobe to affect us in meaningful ways. Maybe we can get these pieces to our puzzle back.",1580184146.0

1	|	[](/MIL) Bucks	|	--	|	40-6	|	The Bucks are very quietly on an 8 game win streak, but hey that sort of thing happens when you're 40-6. Donte DiVincenzo continues to look like a future star despite his lack of box score stats. Khris has continuted to be incredible in his role, being arguably a top 3 ""second-fiddle"" this season. And the whole team got to pretty much hang out in Paris all week. It's a good time to be a Bucks fan. [RIP Kobe](https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1218%2Fr303897_1296x729_16-9.jpg)	|
2	|	[](/LAL) Lakers	|	--	|	36-10	|	Simply put, without Kobe I wouldn’t be into basketball. My earliest basketball memories involve me at 7 years old begging my dad to stay up to watch the Kobe/Shaq Lakers, particularly the 2000 finals and the game 4 where Shaq fouled out and Kobe closed the game out in overtime. Kobe ignited a passion in basketball for me that has burned for nearly 20 years at this point. Hell, I got into reddit by arguing with proto-nephews on /r/nba about Kobe when I was a freshman in college, a college that I chose in part because of its basketball program, a decision I wouldn’t have made without Kobe getting me into the sport. As with all of you, my final memory of Kobe on the basketball court was his closeout 60 point game, and it left me inspired that no matter what obstacles are in one’s way, no matter how many roadblocks one had to overcome, one can persevere and finish what they started on one’s own terms. This tragedy is just unfathomable and my heart goes out to of course the Bryant family for the loss of Kobe and GiGi, but also the Altobellis, the Chesters, and the Zobayans.	|
3	|	[](/UTA) Jazz	|	--	|	32-13	|	Just in case you missed it, Rudy Gobert had [another amazing block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxMlx7MBJlw) in the clutch against Dallas on Saturday, giving the Jazz another win in their hot start of the 2020 calender year. A tougher test for Utah's roster is right around the corner with an upcoming barrage of Western Conference contending teams on the schedule docket before All Star Weekend hits in February, hopefully with Gobert and Mitchell attending. On another note, a [few highlighted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPSD6PerduQ) [memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y64OsZNYhp0) on the [career of Kobe Bryant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMtli7Z9MDw) 	|
4	|	[](/LAC) Clippers	|	+1	|	33-14	|	Obviously Kobe had such an impact on LA sports, and honestly made it harder for the Clippers to make a name for themselves in the early 2000s. Luckily his insane skill and Dan Gilbert's saltiness led to Chris Paul being sent to LAC. Lob city was the begining of a real identity for the Clippers. Which led to [this moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrXZ3kFrB0I). Currently though, the Clippers are playing pretty well, and once PG comes back I'm sure they'll play better than ever.	|
5	|	[](/TOR) Raptors	|	+4	|	32-14	|	Following a 7-0 stretch these past two weeks, the raptors have moved their way into the 2nd seed in the east. With a favourable schedule remaining, and continued domination of teams below .500, the outlook on the remainder of this season is extremely promising. However none of the raptors domination as of late could ever compare to the dominating 81 point performance Kobe Bryant once put up against the raptors in what will forever go down as the greatest and most memorable loss in raptors franchise history. That game was truly a testament to his relentlessness and desire to win above all else. May both he and Gianna Rest In Peace.	|
6	|	[](/DEN) Nuggets	|	+1	|	32-14	|	The year was 2009. The Nuggets were riding high as they entered the Western Conference Finals to face off against the powerhouse Los Angeles Lakers, who were on a mission themselves to avenge their loss in the finals to Boston the previous year. While the Lakers won the hard fought series in 6 games enroute to the first of their back-to-back championships, the main entertainment during the series was the legendary duels between the two stars on the court, Carmelo Anthony and Kobe Bryant. [Game 1 was perhaps the best of the series, as Melo finished with 39 points and 6 rebounds, while Kobe managed to top him with 40 points and 6 rebounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDdiSCt1zVU) enroute to a 105-103 Lakers victory. This was one of many memories of Kobe's dominance that left me infuriated and awestruck as a Nuggets fan. Rest easy, Mamba. Your legacy will live on forever.	|
7	|	[](/MIA) Heat	|	+1	|	31-14	|	""Every man has two deaths, when he is buried in the ground and the last time someone says his name. In some ways men can be immortal."" - Ernest Hemingway// Shouting Kobe's name whenever you shot the ball was always like a prayer to guide the shot on its journey. Kobe will be  a man that could create magic out of the unlikeliest places www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8Tk_AK45eA.  RIP Kobe, Gianna, and the rest of the passengers onboard who were taken from their families and loved ones way too early.           Dion Waiters finally made his appearance and it went better than anyone expected. January has gone just like how I hoped although some of the losses (like to the Nets and Knicks) bother me. We've had trouble in the later parts of the game for the past few weeks where we'd make it unnecessarily close and dance with a loss. Hopefully, as the playoffs get closer we get better at closing the door when ahead.  	|
8	|	[](/BOS) Celtics	|	-4	|	30-15	|	Since the last powerrankings, the Celtics are 4-4 with victories over Bulls, Lakers, Grizzlies, and Magic, and losses to the Pelicans, Pistons, Bucks, and Suns. It's an extremely hard stretch of games and it'll continue to be so for about another month, with the Celtics playing 7 games over the next 2 weeks with matchups against the Heat (2nd night of a back-to-back), Warriors, 76ers, Hawks, Magic, Hawks again, and then the Thunder. And of course with the awful news yesterday regarding Kobe's tragic passing, [let's remember his final game in Boston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0shp8g5cVyU).	|
9	|	[](/PHI) 76ers	|	+2	|	30-17	|		|
10	|	[](/DAL) Mavericks	|	--	|	28-17	|	Dallas was finally healthy again, but just minutes into that, Dwight Powell went down with an Achilles rupture. He was an advanced stats favorite and did the dirty work on the floor, so his presence will be missed. Mavs also acquired Willie Cauley-Stein in the meantime. More importantly, I'd like to move on to tell my favorite Kobe memory. It has to be the Matt Barnes incident with the ball fake. I watched that game live, and as most of you that have interacted with me know, I'm a big Magic fan along with Mavs since I'm from Orlando originally. When he didn't even flinch, that's when I knew all of the ""Mamba Mentality"" stuff was real. The other memory I have of Kobe was the realization in 2006 of how great he was. I remember sitting in a Chili's with my parents and seeing the TV talking about how he was carrying the team. I was 12 at the time, and I wasn't exactly great at breaking down what I had seen, so I relied on ESPN. I had hated Kobe for the prior 6 years, but that was a turning point for me. From there, I really became interested in keeping up with basketball more- I committed to watching more Mavs games since I didn't have league pass, and I made damn sure to tune in when Kobe was on. May Kobe rest in peace. I wish he could know how many people he impacted, even in the slightest regard. He changed the NBA for the better.	|
11	|	[](/IND) Pacers	|	+1	|	30-17	|	Despite tough losses to both Utah and Portland, the Pacers concluded a 5-game road trip with a 3-2 record. The Pacers played without Malcolm Brogdon and Myles Turner at various points of the trip, and still managed to hit the 30-win mark on the road. T.J. Warren in particular had a very nice road trip,  averaging over 20 points per game at nearly 60% from the field. Indiana gets a nice 2-day break to recuperate before the day everyone has been waiting for: Wednesday, January 29. The return of Victor Oladipo.	|
12	|	[](/HOU) Rockets	|	-6	|	28-17	|	The story of the past couple weeks has been the downfall of Harden and the rise of Westbrook. The results haven't been going our way for this recent stretch, but anything we have salvaged can be attributed to Westbrook stepping up big time.  But us fans have confidence that Harden has a good head on his shoulders and he'll get back to his ways soon enough. Kobe did, too. He once told Tyson Chandler after a pickup game with a young James Harden in 2011, ""he's going to be the next one after me.""	|
13	|	[](/OKC) Thunder	|	--	|	28-19	|	Oklahoma City's memories of Kobe Bryant are a story of succession, of the passing of a baton, of firsts and lasts. In April of 2010, an overachieving young Thunder team walked into Los Angeles to face Bryant's juggernaut 1-seed Lakers in OKC's first ever playoff series. The result was an electrifying duel between Bryant and the rising stars Durant and Westbrook, both 10 years his junior. Though the heavily favored Lakers triumphed on the court 4-2, the series proved to be a victory of sorts for all sides. With Westbrook embodying Bryant's fierce, ruthless competitiveness and Durant embodying his killer instinct as a stone-cold closer, Bryant's legacy shaped the future of basketball in Oklahoma City like few others.	|
14	|	[](/MEM) Grizzlies	|	--	|	22-24	|	Don’t let the return of Zion, and ESPN’s shattering orgasm at his return, distract you from the fact that Ja Morant is still the clear-cut Rookie of the Year. Also… I think we are a playoff team? We didn’t rebuild so much as reload. Outside the main guys, Clarke looks to have been an absolute steal and Brooks deserves more credit than he gets. Also, not Grizz related, but rest in peace Kobe.	|
15	|	[](/SAS) Spurs	|	+2	|	20-25	|		|
16	|	[](/ORL) Magic	|	-1	|	21-26	|	The past couple months have not gone great for the Magic. Games generally start off well, but those stretches late in the first half and early second half always seem to follow a pattern. Lose the lead or a deficit gets even bigger. Hard to see this roster getting anywhere with its current build. Maybe WeltHam are gonna need to make another big splash at the deadline. On a more real note, Kobe was an all-time great and who could ever forget him [staring down Matt Barnes](https://youtu.be/aYLR4BcX7Rg?t=142) like it was nothing?	|
17	|	[](/POR) Trail Blazers	|	+2	|	20-27	|	Damian Lillard's first career game was against Kobe. The Bean scored 47 that night, but had high praise for the Blazer guard. In the last week of Kobe's life, Lillard channeled his inner Kobe, going off for 47 himself, 61, and 50 in three consecutive games. His supperb play hasn't translaetd to a ton of wins, but that's hardly his fault. He's doing everything he can to keep the ship afloat. RIP Kobe. 	|
18	|	[](/NOP) Pelicans	|	+4	|	18-29	|	Kobe had a lot of great moments against this team. One of his most mythical stories was [when he hurt his shooting shoulder, so he finished the game playing left handed](https://youtu.be/NuXfJJR0eFk). He made [big plays](https://youtu.be/4mxiTQgX71o). He had [great comebacks](https://youtu.be/c0yJVX74rC0). But what I'll always remember the most was when [Kobe came into town during his farewell tour and dominated us on national television for a win against a desperate Pels squad](https://youtu.be/c0yJVX74rC0). Rest in Paradise Bean. 	|
19	|	[](/PHX) Suns	|	-1	|	19-27	|	Kobe Bryant was an incredible basketball player who tormented and dominated the Phoenix Suns for years. As good as he was as a player, from am outsider's perspective he seemed to be an even better father to his four daughters. The same way he helped so many discover their passion of hoops, he inspired parents to be better for their kids. Rest in peace Kobe, Gianna, John, Keri, Alyssa, Christina, and the unnamed others.	|
20	|	[](/BKN) Nets	|	-4	|	19-26	|	It's been a tough stretch for the Nets. Even with Kyrie back, the team is struggling with injuries and poor play. But, with the recent passing of Kobe, I don't feel like writing much about the Nets. Kobe was a pillar of the NBA and for most of us on this subreddit, he was around for the entirity of our exposure to the sport. I was only a little 6 year old kid when Kobe and Shaq decimated my New Jersey Nets and I was given an early understanding that Kobe was one tough motherf*cker. His continued impact on the sport led me to become a huge fan of him as a person, leader, and representative of the sport. He taught so many of us that perserverance and drive could lead you to anything you put your mind to. His legend grew to a myth as time went on and stories began to leak of his unparalled work ethic. I look forward to teaching my kids about the life and story of Kobe Bryant.	|
22	|	[](/CHI) Bulls	|	+2	|	18-30	|	Ya like guards? Watch the Bulls. With WCJ, Lauri, and rookie Daniel Gafford all sustaining multi-week injuries, the Bulls are running 3-PG lineups most of the time now. We've been alternating wins and losses for the past few weeks thanks to who? You guessed it- Zach LaVine, who is averaging 30 points per game in the year 2020 and finished 6th in East backcourt All-Star voting. GarPax and Boylen continue to mismanage this team, and if things continue at the current pace then the Bulls may just wind up finishing the season in the dreaded 9th seed. /// Being in different conferences, Kobe Bryant and the Bulls didn't match up too often, but that didn't stop the Black Mamba from always being memorable to us. At age 19, Kobe dropped 33 in the United Center. MJ asked Coach Jackson to keep him in despite the Bulls' 4th-quarter lead just so he could continue to match up against Kobe. Can't get any more legendary than that. Thank you Kobe. #RIP	|
22	|	[](/DET) Pistons	|	+3	|	17-30	|	The Pistons suck. Reggie Jackson is back and looks healthy which is fun but also mostly meaningless. The team appears to be in a sort of limbo until the deadline. Everyone knows that several players are likely on their way out, and it is hanging over the whole team. Regardless of who all leaves, everyone is ready for the deadline to pass so we can just know what the team will look like the rest of the season.	|
23	|	[](/SAC) Kings	|	-2	|	16-29	|	RIP	|
24	|	[](/WAS) Wizards	|	+2	|	15-30	|	My original favorite player, Kobe Bryant was a huge part of my childhood and was one of the primary reasons that I fell in love with basketball. The first NBA game that I ever attended was between the Wizards and the Lakers, and I remember cheering just as loudly when Kobe scored as when the Wiz did. My personal favorite Kobe moment was his epic offensive duel with Gilbert Arenas in 2007 (For those interested, here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFqsCucNY0) ). It was truly incredible watching Kobe and Arenas score back and forth, each one going at each other up and down the court. They ended up combining for 105 points, and I remember going to school the next morning trying to impersonate them during recess at school. I saw a rerun of it on NBA Hardwood Classics last year and found myself being just as awestruck then as I was as a kid. Rest in peace Kobe, Gianna, and the others killed in the horrific crash. The game will miss you and remember you forever. As for today's Wizards...um...we're 15 games under .500 but still only 4 games out of the playoffs!	|
25	|	[](/CHA) Hornets	|	-2	|	15-31	|	The Hornets are on an eight-game losing streak. That doesn’t seem important right now. Charlotte drafted Kobe Bryant 13th overall in 1996 and traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Kobe-against-my-team moment I remember most was [his game winner](https://youtu.be/fcl1Tv90OaM?t=622) against the Bobcats on March 12, 2005, in the old Charlotte Coliseum. I was ten years old, and I cried that night. I lamented that basketball was so unfair, and that Kobe was just too good. I cried last night too, fifteen years later. I lamented that life was so unfair, and that Kobe was just too young. Rest In Peace, Mamba - there will never be another competitor like you.	|
26	|	[](/MIN) TWolves	|	-6	|	15-31	|	RIP Kobe	|
27	|	[](/NYK) Knicks	|	+1	|	13-34	|	“Silently, one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven, blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.”― Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie// Sixty-One points in Madison Square Garden. The duel with Jeremy Lin. The 1998 rookie All-Star performance against Michael Jordan. Kobe Bean Bryant represents the very best of basketball, sportsmanship, fatherhood and self-actualization. New York City will never forget him, and neither shall the world.	|
28	|	[](/ATL) Hawks	|	+2	|	12-35	|	Trae Young is an all-star starter and the Hawks are close to finally having all their rotation players healthy and playing for the first time this season. We are still bottom of the barrel in the league, but with our schedule finally becoming a little easier, expect the Hawks to start improving. 	|
29	|	[](/CLE) Cavaliers	|	-2	|	12-34	|	[Here's to the rivalry that made me fall in love with basketball in the early 2000s](https://cavsnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Getty-Images-1.jpg) that never made it onto the ultimate stage but captivated millions, and thank you Kobe for [mentoring our young star](https://cdn.sporx.com/img/59/2019/kobekryryr.jpg) and helping inspire him to be a part of a team that changed our city's sports history forever. Rest in peace, Kobe Bryant.	|
30	|	[](/GSW) Warriors	|	-1	|	10-37	|	Warriors fans got used to years of Kobe delivering us Ls. Games would end with him on the bench or burying clutch free throws to drown any shot at a comeback. Lakers were the ticket and Oracle was filled with Kobe and Laker fans. [In the early Frobe years Antawn and Kobe dueled out 51 points each at Oracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbFR8sXz_gc). Outside of that highlight moment one of the most #mambamoments against the Warriors was his [torn achilles](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g2afNT_7c9o). While obviously not a high note of his career, he still got up with a torn Achilles and took those two free throws to tie up the game.""Pain doesn't tell you when you ought to stop. Pain is the little voice in your head thattries to hold you back because it knows if you continue you will change."" -Kobe. #mambaout but lives on as a legend forever.	|",1580179906.0

Are the bulls willing to part ways with them? Do you guys think they fit right in? Are they even an upgrade? And who would need to be traded?

I could always turn on a Blazer game and get cheered up watching my team. Or I could always just go online and talk about the NBA with other die hard fans. Most of all, before all of this, I could just walk to the park and get shots up and pretend I was an NBA player. I always thought I had basketball to fall back on when life gets tough. So it’s just so weird having something tragic happen to the thing that was always supposed to be my safe place.

Now, when I try to turn to basketball I get reminded of this tragedy. When an Artist I listen to passes, I rarely ever listen to their music again because I just feel so bad about them missing out on life. Basketball is just such a major part of my life and what I am pursuing in to after College, it just so rough to go back.

&#x200B;

Like the game just seems so meaningless right now. A 13 year old who loved the game will never get to play again. A beautiful girl who was inspiring other younger girls to work on their skills and play basketball. 

&#x200B;

Like how can a team play against the Lakers knowing an entire state is mourning after losing their hero? Idk, I hope this passes with time it just all seems so weird right now.

&#x200B;

I always hated Kobe since I was a die hard Blazer fan. But seeing how much he loved his family and how dedicated he was to pushing the game forward by mentoring younger players was so great to see. He was just such a great man off the court and he deserved to grow old and live his life in retirement. He put in SO MUCH work throughout his playing career and had so much success, I was so happy how he was living it up with his family and business ventures. His love for storytelling and creativity was so cool to see. He was just such a charismatic and inspirational guy.

&#x200B;

I AM SORRY, last time I wrote something like this, I got a bunch of comments that said Reddit isn't your diary. I am just down and feel so weird that something so tragic happened in Basketball.

748,Idolizing what was Kobe Bryant,0,eurmyk,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eurmyk/idolizing_what_was_kobe_bryant/,7,"Growing up we’re taught not to idolize athletes because, well, “they’re just athletes who were blessed with talent”. While I agreed with this mostly, I still was always enamored with what these athletes were able to do in their respective fields. Since the passing of Kobe Bryant, I’ve been reflecting on why some of these athletes should be idolized and it has nothing to do with what they accomplish on the court. 

Kobe Bryant is well known as one of the greatest Lakers and basketball players to ever live and a lot of that is due to his work ethic. He was the first person on the court and the last person off. He had more talent than 95% of the NBA but still worked harder than anyone. He understood failure was a guarantee and an inevitability but still stared it down in its face and charged at it. A lot of us, including myself, will do whatever we can to avoid failures. We’ll avoid pushing ourselves in anything or trying to master new things because, firstly, it’s hard and hey, if we don’t try then that’s why I failed not because I wasn’t good enough. This keeps us from progressing and it leaves us elbows deep in a bag of Cheetos playing World of Warcraft, feeling sorry for ourselves. There’s so much opportunity for us if we would just push ourselves to our limits; whether it be in our jobs, our health, or even our hobbies. Our bodies, minds, souls will fail us at points, it’s how we react to those failures. In 2013 Kobe tore his achilles during a game at the age of 34, which would be the end of most players careers. Instead, Kobe worked his ass off and came back to play another year and a half. 

His work ethic went far beyond basketball. He started Kobe Inc. in 2018 to make investments in sports-related business ventures and struck gold when he invested in BODYARMOR sports drink. He published a book that same year entitled ""The Mamba Mentality: How I Play.""  He wrote children’s books to teach his kids life lessons through the use of sports. Bryant's most impressive off-court accomplishment was writing and narrating ""Dear Basketball,"" the Academy Award-winning animated short about his love of basketball. He also spoke 3 languages. 

Kobe had just as much time in his days as any of us and look what he accomplished. If we start to push ourselves just a little bit like he did, this world would advance so much physically, mentally and emotionally. So if you’ve been thinking about getting to the gym, get your ass to the gym and push yourself, if you’ve been thinking about learning a new language, set time aside and work your absolute hardest to learn it, if you’ve been thinking about asking someone out but don’t want to be denied, don’t be afraid, accept the possibility and run through it. 

We all have an opportunity to reflect right now and change who we are. We don’t need to live empty lives, we can look at failure like Kobe did, accept it and shrug it off. If you don’t fail then you never really tried. Kobe said this best: 

“Everything negative - pressure, challenges - is all an opportunity for me to rise.”
- Kobe Bryant


“Be sad. Be mad. Be frustrated. Scream. Cry. Sulk. When you wake up you will think it was just a nightmare only to realize it’s all too real. You will be angry and wish for the day back, the game back THAT play back. But reality gives nothing back and nor should you.”

- Kobe Bryant 

Kobe wasn’t perfect, he made mistakes just like we all do. He learned from these mistakes and bettered himself. In the end, he was everything he wanted to be. Take what’s yours and be your best self, just like Kobe.",1580176981.0

Kobe was much bigger than basketball. He had hundreds of millions of followers all around the world, most likely over a billion. He was one of the great figures of our time, and has inspired countless people to ruthlessly pursuit their dreams no matter the costs. The Mamba mentality will never die.

Rest in peace King. Gone, but never forgotten.

My opinion is that much NBA coverage is childish and leads nowhere.  For example,  Espn's biggest show, Get Up, routinely asks if Kobe is better than LeBron, or who the top 5 all time players are. This leads nowhere and creates a circle jerk of judgment statements. And today it makes them look like petty twerps-- the night LBJ passed Kobe, the commentators were casting judgment on Kobe as they answered the same questions they have been asking for several years now.  

Suddenly everything is put into perspective, but the discourse was still catching up.  I was watching last night and they began every interview with the asinine, ""what's your reaction?"" 

Maybe one good thing that could come from this is more mature discussions of the game, less focus on dumb all time rankings, more focus on the players as people and the game as part of real life. Or at least a more in depth discussion of details that we can appreciate, that show how we can draw something from the game instead of just declaring which player pleases your highness the most.  I'm very interested to see if media coverage changes at all after this whole event.

Now this was recorded before the Mavs traded for Cauly-Stein, but I think they could still be looking to bolster their front court in light of the Dwight Powell injury. 

Jackie Mac said she assumed the Cavs would want a first round pick for Thompson and I agree. Problem is, the Mavs don't have many 1sts they can surrender, and idk if Cleveland would even want their 2025 1st, but they do have the Warriors 2nd round pick, which is almost certainly going to be #31. So the main structure of the deal would look like this:

Mavericks receive: Tristan Thompson

Cavaliers receive: Courtney Lee, Boban Marajanovic, GSW 2020 2nd Rd pick.

Now I think the Cavs would want Dallas to sweeten the deal slightly more. Like I said, they want a first round pick, they aren't getting one, and the players they are getting back don't hold any value to the Cavs while they also provide future financial relief to Dallas. 

Edit: So the consensus is that Brunson is too valuable to be in this deal. I kind of suspected that. So Maybe the Mavs throw in their 2022 2nd round pick instead, or I've seen some ideas involving Justin Jackson. Both are good options I think.

I think the Cavs would be interested in Jalen Brunson. Delly is off the books after this year so the Cavs will be looking for a new backup PG. I'm unsure how much the Mavs value Brunson, but that could tip the scales too far the other way. If that's the case, another 2nd round pick would probably get the job done.",1580171446.0

My favorite player as a kid was Kenyon Martin and when looking back I was going through his basketball reference page and as an adult his career feels underwhelming. In this game 3, Kmart had a special performance and went shot for shot with Kobe. I was heartbroken when he was traded but his career numbers regressed after his 2004-05 season. Would you consider Kenyon Martin a bust or the average expectation for a #1 overall pick and what is his legacy? It feels like there was a lot of wasted potential to his career for a four year college player entering the league with a skillset favored by the early 2000s NBA even when compared to the historically weak draft class.

*A story about Kobe Bryant, as told by a professional trainer who worked with Bryant this past Summer, for the Olympics:*  


*I’ve been a professional athletic trainer for about 16 years and have been able to work with a range of athletes from the high school to professional level. Right now I run in a clinic in Cincinnati and have most recently been training with some players on the Bengals.*  


*I activated my reddit account just a moment ago and because I’ve been seeing the videos of Kobe’s most recent dunks and the comments you guys have had to share I decided I might as well chime in what I know about the man. And let me just state by saying that this story doesn’t touch on anything we don’t know about Kobe but rather that he simply is not human when he is working on his craft.*  


*I was invited to Las Vegas this past Summer to help Team USA with their conditioning before they head off to London, and as we know they would eventually bring home the Gold (USA). I’ve had the opportunity to work with Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade in the past but this would be my first interaction with Kobe. We first met three days before the first scrimmage, on the day of the first practice, early July. It was a brief conversation where we talked about conditioning, where he would like to be by the end of the Summer, and we talked a little bit about the hustle of the Select Team. Then he got my number and I let him know that if he ever wanted some extra training he could hit me up any time.*  


*The night before the first scrimmage I remember I was just watched “Casablanca” for the first time and it was about 3:30 AM. I lay in bed, slowly fading away when I hear my cell ring. It was Kobe. I nervously picked up.*  


*“Hey, uhh Rob, I hope I’m not disturbing anything right?”*  


*“Uhh no, what’s up Kob?”*  


*“Just wondering if you could just help me out with some conditioning work, that’s all.”*  


*I checked my clock. 4:15 AM.*  


*“Yeah sure, I’ll see you in the facility in a bit.”*  


*It took me about twenty minutes to get my gear and out of the hotel. When I arrived and opened the room to the main practice floor I saw Kobe. Alone. He was drenched in sweat as if he had just taken a swim. It wasn’t even 5AM.*  


*We did some conditioning work for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Then we entered the weight room, where he would do a multitude of strength training exercises for the next 45 minutes. After that we parted ways and he went back to the practice floor to shoot. I went back to the hotel and crashed. Wow.*  


*I was expected to be at the floor again at about 11 AM. I woke up feeling sleepy, drowsy, and almost pretty much every side effect of sleep deprivation. Thanks, Kobe. I had a bagel and headed to the practice facility.*  


*This next part I remember very vividly. All the Team USA players were there, feeling good for the first scrimmage. LeBron was talking to Carmelo if I remember correctly and Coach Krzyzewski was trying to explain something to Kevin Durant. On the right side of the practice facility was Kobe by himself shooting jumpers. And this is how our next conversation went – I went over to him, patted him on the back and said, “Good work this morning.”*  


*“Huh?”*  


*“Like, the conditioning. Good work.”*  


*“Oh. Yeah, thanks Rob. I really appreciate it.”*  


*“So when did you finish?”*  


*“Finish what?”*  


*“Getting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?”*  


*“Oh just now. I wanted 800 makes so yeah, just now.”*  


*My jaw dropped. Mother of holy God. It was then that I realized that there’s no surprise to why he’s been as effective as he was last season. Every story about his dedication, every quote that he’s said about hard work all came together and hit me like a train. It’s no surprise to me now that he’s dunking on players ten years younger than him and it wasn’t a surprise to me earlier this year when he led the league in scoring.*  


*Thanks for reading and allowing me to share you my Kobe Bryant story. If anyone has any questions I can clarify. Sorry if the story was at all hard to follow as this is my first time on reddit.*  


*Rob.*",1580163611.0

Even though I never met him, he was always around. Always on TV, always in the media, he was just always there. Watching him play lit a fire in me, made me go out and shoot hoops for 4 hours after school until it got dark, 8 hours on the weekends. 

I wasn't close to my dad, but one of the few conversations I remember having with him was the day after Kobe scored 81. Thank you Kobe for bringing us together for once. 

It's still hard to process this loss, but I know life will go on eventually. It's hard to believe that our hero and idol died in this way, he was as close to a superhero we had. There's no way he died, right? Surely he escaped that helicopter in some dramatic way only a superhero can. 

Thank you Kobe for helping me realize that I shouldn't waste time in life, that I should be doing what I love to do. I should go start that business, I should go make some art, I should do what I have a fire for in my heart. I should express my love and gratitude to those close to me, hit up people I haven't talked to in awhile and see how they're doing.

I would guess Dwight will rock a Kobe 8 Jersey in the dunk contest.

What would normally be one the most joyous weekends in the league will have a dramatically different feel this season. Truly devastating and heartbreaking. Still doesn't seem real.

Anyone else have any ideas of something unique that can be done over the weekend?",1580158429.0

Kobe also collaborated with Glen Keane and John Williams in 2017 to create an animated short film narrated by the man himself. It went on to win an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film. [This is the only full video of it that I can find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3x5C3iNLKo)

844,Dedicated to the late Kobe Bryant,26,eun4ds,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eun4ds/dedicated_to_the_late_kobe_bryant/,6,"Twas the year 2006 of January the 22nd,

quite an uneventful day most people would reckon,

Laker fans prepared to sit in their seat,

ready to watch two teams compete,

Kobe came out with eyes on the crowd,

roaring with thunder the arena was loud,

a show alas he was ready to give,

one to remember for as long as we live!

&#x200B;

Two days prior, was given a poor shooting night,

Now he came out, ready to put all his might

In a game unlike anything we’ve had to behold,

From now on, stories are still being told

Of the night Kobe came out and showed everyone

That he was a legend putting up 81.

&#x200B;

Two minutes in, he drove to the basket,

ready to lay his opponent in a casket,

up he went, majestically soared through the air,

scooped in a reverse lay-up, for him not quite rare,

fade-away, jumper, off the glass, bank-shot and in!

it’s why we shout Kobe when throwing trash in a bin!

&#x200B;

18 minutes in, opponents are wavering,

too much space given, which Kobe is savoring,

with a hand in his face, he sinks in a three,

not many do it as easily I’m sure you’d agree,

turn away if you dare, help one pass away,

but soon you’ll find out that he’ll make you pay,

take your eyes off him for a second and learn,

how fast he can go it’ll make your belly churn,

rising above the opponents so high,

on dunk and on jumpers, he took to the sky.

&#x200B;

3rd quarter arrived, Lakers were still down,

a fan was spotted stifling a yawn,

nobody expected anything extraordinary,

much less something that can be seen as legendary,

26 points had been scored for the team by Kobe,

half the game gone, he reached a moment of clarity,

the Raptors were fearsome, their talons a reachin,

but Kobe would not stop, the gospel he was preaching,

drive past the whole team, softly lay up the ball?

or pump fake and shoot over a defensive wall?

ball stolen by Kobe, he’s left all alone!

9 feet tomahawk in, the Raptors all groan,

he’s taken the lead, we could all feel something ticking,

within the Black Mamba something was a clicking!

low efficiency? never passes? gets empty stats?

watch and learn haters while Kobe teaches you brats

that he’s one of the greatest, and that’s that!

&#x200B;

27 in the 3rd? By golly, he’s done it!

53 points! a feat you must credit!

is it possible to surpass MJ’s 69?

sitting out now, would really be fine!

but his name is Black Mamba and he doesn’t quit,

so long as his opponents do not submit

to the tenacity and ferociousness that he brings,

his opponents are quivering, what poor things,

free throw after free throw, each one a sinker,

of all his shots, not one is a stinker,

“MVP!” the crowd chants, they are all quite elated,

a performance this astounding would seem to be fated

for such a great player as he,

the fans all roar out of glee,

here he comes charging at speed of great pacing,

and here the defenders come chasing.

&#x200B;

Like his idol before him, he was quite a master

of the triple threat, any good forecaster

could tell you confidently what was a-happening

hippity hoppity, his offense was maddening,

In another three! Two more, there goes!

Keeping the defense quick on their toes!

He’s reached 70, dear god, when will he stop!

Reach and he pulls out the stop-and-pop!

The raptors at this point have clearly given in

Shoulders aslump, drooped are their chin,

At this point, it seems like nothing could stop him

his shots went in one by one right through the rim

In one last desperate attempt, the raptors all foul,

bidding the crowd adieu, he goes out with a bow.

&#x200B;

81 points, only done once before.

Laker legend, solidified, straight to the core,

Generational player, a sight to be witnessed,

to all basketball fans, he was one of the dearest,

on this sorrowful, powerful day,

we all kneel down to the ground and pray,

one of a kind, the black mamba was,

for no reason other than because

he was not jordan, nor wilt or shaquille,

his name was kobe, his destiny to fulfill,

he loved basketball unlike any other,

mastered the game till he became

a pure skill driven athletic dominant basketball wonder.",1580156017.0
845,[OC] Kobe Bryant and the Rest of Us,115,eun373,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eun373/oc_kobe_bryant_and_the_rest_of_us/,15,"**I wrote this in the hours after learning of Sunday’s tragedy. In hope of not adding pointless noise to the conversation, I have held off on posting.**

**While I understand if the mods remove this, writing this has been incredibly important in processing my emotions around these events and I hope it is of some value to the rest of this sub.**

The events of this weekend hit me harder than I thought they would.

I’m often dubious when a celebrity death invites comments like “he had so much more to give!”, particularly when the deceased is decades past social relevance or their creative peak. In this case, “he” did have so much more to give. Kobe was smart, creative and business-savvy. He still had one foot in the basketball world, was making great films and clearly positioning himself to win a Most Valuable Dad award in the coming years. It’s crazy to say about someone who ranks among the greatest performers ever in their field, but we have likely been robbed of Kobe Bryant’s true peak.

I’m grappling with how to process this, as I’m sure many others are. I keep Googling his name, as if his Wikipedia details will change between hits of the F5 key. The *in memoriam* articles will come out in the following days and weeks, filled with his iconic moments – [81 points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeXZY4eVLlo), the [cross and lob to Shaq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jELrZ32qrMI) or [dropping 60 in his final game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdGeXcJ-hfo). But for me, none of these moments quite capture what made Kobe *different*.

I’ve tried watching the highlights and listening to the interviews, but I keep coming back to [Game 5 of the 2010 Western Conference Finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7tN59DhZho).

I was pumped for a Suns title. With Miami out in the First Round, I adopted a Phoenix team on their last great run as they swept the old enemy Spurs and set up a Lakers showdown. I was in my teens and supposed to be studying for an exam the following week. Instead, I paced around the living room, locked in running commentary over the phone with fellow non-studier Josh as we watched the game.

Game 5 is best remembered for [Ron Artest’s put-back game-winner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4seP2wD_K4). But that’s not what I remember most. Phoenix did an incredible job of defending Kobe all night, keeping him out of the paint and forcing him into contested 20 footers. It didn’t matter. He kept coming.

Fadeaway over a double-team, bang. Turnaround to his right, bang. Fake, one dribble, pullup, bang.

As the game wore on, Josh and I stopped even discussing the play. Our conversation devolved into this:

“Oh, \*\*\*\* off!”

“Are you \*\*\*\*ing kidding me?”

“\*\*\*\* you, Kobe Bryant.”

It wasn’t even in anger. It was a sign of respect. Phoenix were playing their hearts out, but Kobe was playing better. No match up would slow him, no rotation was going to stop him. He was inevitable. What else could you say but “\*\*\*\* you”?

We should’ve seen it coming. Fresh off his first post-Shaq title, Kobe played that season with a newfound freedom, trusting his teammates more than ever before and repeatedly topping himself with an incredible run of [game-winners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5DkRYOC09A) that had us thinking, “no, he can’t do it again.”

Revisiting Game 5 stoked the fires of a long-standing thought – Kobe was great almost in spite of himself. He was simultaneously infuriating and captivating, a high-risk, high wire act every night. Nobody routinely took and sank terrible shots with the same regularity. Nobody pivoted 8 times after picking up their dribble and somehow manufactured a good shot like he did. He wasn’t a perfectly constructed player – at times boneheaded, selfish and defensively inconsistent – but nobody added to their game like Kobe did. The adage of returning from the offseason with one new weapon may not have been invented by Kobe, but he certainly popularized it. The impeccably timed footwork, well-rehearsed faceup game and meticulously detailed post moves were forged in blood and sweat.

Kobe was an extraordinary talent, but on paper there’s no definitive reason he should’ve overtaken the other contenders for the throne in the post-Jordan NBA. Vince Carter was more athletic and a better shooter from outside. T-Mac brought more natural size, defense and passing to the table. LeBron was more complete coming into the league. Was Kobe more naturally gifted than Jerry Stackhouse or Harold Miner? Maybe?

I used to enjoy Mamba Mentality(TM) in the same way as pre-breakdown [Conor McGregor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Szj21arytU) – [shameless, tongue-in-cheek self-promotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ickn8iipxUc). In the years to come we’ll see it as the blueprint, the method by which Kobe ground his way to the top of the heap. Every time we thought he was done – early struggles in the clutch, the dark years post-Shaq, tearing his damn achilles – he came back stronger. On his scariest nights, he resembled a slasher villain more than a shooting guard. *What do you mean, he’s still scoring?* He kept coming and coming, [mangled fingers be damned](https://sports.yahoo.com/kobe-bryant-index-finger-83-old-man--nba.html). None of those other guys had that drive. Few humans do. We tend to the think of “willing yourself to victory” as an in-game performance, overcoming adversity in the moment. But Kobe willed himself to victory every day. He worked himself to the bone, practiced bad shots until they became good shots. Inch by inch, he separated himself from the pack. Over 20 years, those inches added up to miles.

He’s the heir apparent for a reason, successful to the point that his successor to the title of world’s greatest basketball player is still heckled for having “only” three rings. Many of the greats leave us wanting more, others hold on for a little too long. Very few give us all they have, no more and no less. I’ve never heard a Laker fan lament the sixth title that wasn’t or regret the later injury-challenged years. Kobe squeezed every last ounce of potential out of his body. We got 100% of what he could’ve been.

For many, being in the top 0.01% of their profession is enough. This isn’t a bad thing, the time it takes for us to eke out the last drops of potential is not worth the time lost to focus on school, work, social life, family, hobbies, health and wellness. It’s the trade-off we make, those hard-fought hours to make marginal improvements are not worth the time spent enjoying the other parts of our life.

Where the average person sees diminishing returns, Kobe saw returns.

Call it Mamba Mentality, call it hard work, call it getting the most out of life every day. Whatever you call it, that’s the difference. The difference between shooting [four airballs versus the Jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi6fftt43xo) and raising two Finals MVPs. The difference between an ex-basketballer and a multi-hyphenate mogul. The difference between a skinny kid from Philly and an NBA legend.

That’s the difference between Kobe Bryant and the rest of us.",1580155823.0

I personally came across his ‘Dear Basketball’ poem which I hadn’t read in a while, and it was just absolutely beautiful and devastating to read again after this tragedy.

In response, I wanted to write a little something for Kobe and his legacy. It’s nothing much, and I’m not a talented poet by any means. But this is my way of honoring this legend of not only the basketball world, but the entire world. It’s titled “The Immortal Mamba.”

-

24 seconds on the clock

You gotta take the shot

Just say his name and then

Give it all you got

-

Never stop working ‘till

The ball is in the net

A mindset, a mentality

That we won’t soon forget

-

A hero for a generation

The bravest on the court

A champion, invaluable

A story far too short

-

But every now and then

Legends come and go

Even when some still have

So much left to show

-

He may be gone from here

But his spirit still survives

The Mamba is immortal while

The game is still alive

I’m going to try my best to let go off that shit... just isn’t worth it. At the end of the day they’re just putting a damn ball through a hoop. Nothing more. Is not that serious for me to hold content in my heart for human beings that I don’t even personally know. Of course I still want to beat them, but I won’t root for them to fail anymore against other teams... nor will I get a joy out of it. 

I hope people can also let go of their Durant Hate because he went to a team that beat him. At the end of the day... is just game. There’s real life shit after the game is done... and no one is taking any of those accomplishments with them after dying. I’m so tired of hearing “legacy this and legacy that”... who cares! Once you’re dead none of that shit matters whether you were top 10 or top 30... just enjoy a once in a lifetime talent while he’s here... once he retires you won’t see anything like it and will leave a huge void in the game. He’s just a person searching for happiness like you and me.

Same for Harden, Lebron, Embiid, Westbrook and other hated players. 

If you want to hate a player for abusing his wife or molesting children... that’s totally fair. For basketball related reasons? Just not worth it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ensrwr52ad41.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c19451de6a625fad3983384585f7acbecf455be0

I had the privilege of being a coach at Kobe’s basketball camp every summer for five years in a row. A lot of players have branded summer camps, but Kobe wasn't a guy who would put his name on the camp logo, show up once, and cash his check...he would show up daily - sometimes for the 8am greeting to address the 700+ kids in the gym - and was a constant presence throughout the week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8ypya7i72ad41.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=310fd1a933763c9bd07c2a8716cd9502dd660b68

He’d interrupt drills to make sure 8-year olds were running the triangle offense properly. He’d walk through team practices pulling kids aside to give them tips on their jab step. One time I saw him tell a kid “that was a lazy pass” and for the rest of the week the kid passed the ball so hard his teammates could barely catch it. 

The younger kids wouldn’t hear a word he said, they were in shock that an actual God was speaking to them. But you could see in some of the older kids eyes that any time Kobe was nearby, something switched. They moved a little quicker, played a little harder, like some higher level had just been found. 

One year at camp I had a 10-year-old Japanese girl on my team who didn’t speak a word of English, yet still was the only person on the team to grasp the concept of 'help defense.' Kobe was walking by one afternoon, saw her take a perfect charge, and got so excited he ran on to the court to give her a high five DURING the game. He stayed and cheered for her the rest of the game (she ended up taking at least 20 more charges that week, was the biggest hustler on the team and got awarded ""best defense"" for our division. She also couldn't stop smiling and saying ""Kobe high-fived me!"" after that day). 

&#x200B;

Another year I saw him get challenged by a gangly young white kid who walked straight up to him and said “Bet you can’t beat me, I’m the WHITE Mamba.” Later that day while speaking to the entire crowd of kids in the gym, Kobe called that boy out to center court. He played him one-on-one and with all 700+ campers watching, beat the kid 5-0. 

Then one year, after the kids had gone to bed, a few of us were shooting around in the gym with Kobe. The side door opened and we saw Lil Bow Wow walk in, unannounced, with a backpack full of cash (no idea why he was there, the camp was in Santa Barbara). He threw out a challenge, he wanted to play Kobe 1-on-1 for a thousand dollars. Kobe let Bow Wow start the game up 10-0, then proceeded to play harder than anyone I’ve ever seen at ANY level. It didn’t look like he was playing one-on-one with the 5’7” rapper of ‘Shortie Like Mine’ - it felt like he was playing for a championship. Kobe scored 11 straight points, took the stack of cash, turned to us coaches and said “give this to my people.” I got handed $100 and immediately bought new Kobes. 

The last year of camp we had our photo session, coaches each got their own pic with Kobe. I could tell he was tired from the day-long photo shoot when he yawned and said “wassup b” as I walked over. I said “man we’ve been getting the same photo for five years, can we mix it up?” hoping I could find a way to get a laugh out of this overworked exhausted dude who gave so much to the camp every year. He chuckled and said “let’s do it” then immediately cocked his head to the side, crossed his eyes, and as if he hadn't done enough already, made everyone in the room burst out laughing. To this day it makes me smile every time I see it.

Between the moments of hanging with him on the sidelines, listening to his Q&A sessions, and watching how he interacted with kids on a daily basis you could tell this guy had some crazy fire that drove him to not only be better on and off the court, but make everyone around him better too. That’s a pretty amazing legacy to leave behind and I’m beyond grateful to have been influenced and inspired by a man who put so much love in to the world. 

Oh, and I still wear those Kobes. Thanks, Bow Wow.",1580141751.0

> These picture are just the tip of the iceberg of our relationship. He taught me so many things in life that were necessary on and off the court. On the court he taught me how to carve out defenses and how to take my time. How to make winning my ultimate goal. Off the court he taught me to sign my own checks lol. Of course anyone who knows my story knows I’ve suffered a lot of loss but the only loss I can compare this to is when I lost my son. Even though our relationship wasn’t father/son, it was more like him being a teacher and me being his brother. I’m glad I got to be the ying to your yang as far as the locker room was concerned. It was my pleasure. I couldn’t even catch my breath today when I heard this news. I just knew if he was in a helicopter crash he would have been the one to survive. Somehow he would have jumped out and landed on his feet. I’m sitting here thinking about when we would be in practice scrimmaging and you would start the jump ball off with elbowing Sasha in the chest. Like dude it’s 10:30 in the morning lol. You think watching him play was crazy, you gotta think in practice if you scored like 8-9 buckets throughout the practice you had a great practice. I’ve seen him knock off 13-14 in a row in practice!!!! I’m still waiting for the media to come out and say wrong report. No way God took my brother this early. I know I been through my own stuff in life with using drugs and not being good to myself. When I went through that Coma situation if God would have came to me and said we would take me and spare Kobe I would have rather that happened.

Nate’s soliloquy starts at the 5:54 mark.

>	I don’t even know if it would be possible to play the way that he played today... You wouldn’t be taking a long 2 with two guys on you, fading away from 21 feet. He beat people with that even when the other team forced him into taking those shots... When you see those go in the basket, the feeling that inspires, doing the impossible, doing it all by himself and willing his team to victory... With someone like LeBron, who some might say is a better basketball player,  it’s about setting up his teammates and surgical dissection. Those shots that Kobe hit defied the imagination.

I think Nate really had some powerful insight on what it was like to watch Kobe. Kobe really hit some incredible mind boggling shots that absolutely made me believe that anything is possible. Watching him defy logic time after time was so awe-inspiring and truly such a special thing to watch.

I also thought the differentiation between play styles of the two Laker greats was so well put. LeBron has always been about being one step ahead and setting his teammates up or physically overwhelming his opponent. Kobe’s shot selection and success was much more “I don’t care what you do, I’m making this shot.” Nate called Kobe, along with Jordan, the greatest difficult shot maker in the history of the league. 

Rest in peace, Kobe Bryant. Thank you for every memory you created. You inspired millions doing what you loved and your work ethic and drive will live in until the end of time.",1580139290.0

I'm  gonna preface this post is not talking about one player it's a post in  general and has no implications. It is influenced yes but it is not  about a single person there for I don't see a reason to post it in the  megathread. This isn't a reaction from today it's something I thought  about before today.

Here we go  because I feel like this is something that needs to be said and heard. I  learned something this week. To enjoy greatness and to not compare the  greatness we have. I've seen so many players in this league from Jordan  to Giannis to Kobe to Lebron. Players who have been the face of the NBA  and all we do is consistently compare and take away from the greatness  that these players bring us. This week i learned to stop that thinking  and instead move forward loving the NBA as we should and enjoying the  greatness we get to witness night in and night out.

I  used to debate and hate on players a lot just out of their pure skill  of the game and always beating the bulls after MJ. It sucked and I  always found a way to make others sound not as good as they were and  compared them with a dumb number system. This week I'll be throwing the  number system out and I'll be enjoying the game for what it is for the  love of the NBA, for the love of the fans and community we have here.  For the thing that brings us all together, the NBA. That's what this is  all about. I dare you all to do the same, to love the game from Harden  to LBJ to Steph to KD. hell let's even love Kyrie because that's what  matters is us enjoying the game and coming on here to see sick af  highlights and discuss all the cool things we see these players do that  have never been done before.

So sit back, enjoy some Ja crossovers, enjoy some Giannis dunks, love yourself some Lebron no look passes, get frustrated but respect that James Harden step back 3, Watch the Klaw rip your favorite player, See Steph pull up from 30(and Trae, Dame, etc), and many more players pulling off crazy dunks, blocks, steals, off balance 3's. Just enjoy it. Love the game.",1580135982.0

He had 17 points just in the 1st quarter alone. 

Also Lillard has hit 8+ threes in 3 consecutive games. 

All in just 23 shots. Ridiculous

896,[OC] Kobe Bryant's scoring by season - a tribute,760,eui1xb,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eui1xb/oc_kobe_bryants_scoring_by_season_a_tribute/,55,"Much like the rest of the basketball world, I too was shocked to see the news of Kobe's demise this afternoon. While I wasn't lucky enough to watch him play live, I've seen so many highlights on YouTube showing the sheer variety of ways in which the mamba could score buckets.

One of my favourite facts about Kobe was his drastic improvement in scoring after moving into the starting lineup. To illustrate this, I decided to plot out his scoring averages by season. [Here's] (https://imgur.com/a/6BXTJnd) his regular season PPG by season. His jump after his 3rd season was incredible to see. He was an absolute monster during the mid 2000s, devastating opposing defenses with a high of 35.4 ppg in 2005-06! On a sadder note, it's quite apparent the toll his torn achilles tendon took on him during his last three years. To illustrate his prowess in scoring ability, I've also put a reference line showing the average NBA player's ppg (using 2018-19 stats).

As incredible as he was during the regular season, he was one of the rare legends who could turn it up even more during the postseason, [as seen here.](https://imgur.com/a/qTWOHK7) The consistency after his first few seasons is truly a sight to behold, even as his game aged. He just knew how to continuously adapt his game and remain the beast that he was.

**Notes:**

* I used the methodology suggested by Matt Weisinger [here](https://www.quora.com/How-many-points-per-game-does-the-average-NBA-player-score) to calculate the average player's ppg. I used figures from the [2018-19 regular season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019_totals.html) and [post-season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2019_totals.html) to calculate averages by player. I do acknowledge that this would be slightly inflated compared to most of Kobe's career due to a faster pace.

* Game logs were obtained season by season through [basketball reference.] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01/gamelog/2016)

* Data cleaning and analysis were done through a mix of Excel and R. Plotting was done in R using ggplot2.

* A shout out to u/llewellynjean and Kirk Goldsberry of ESPN, I'm inspired every day by their posts.

Player like Trae are punished for having bad teammates, as if this is some kind of advantage? Averaging 9 assist per game, when surrounded by a bunch of G league players IS NOT EASY. In fact I’d argue he’d averaging 10+ assists comfortably if he had a better support cast. 
Averaging 30 points per game is not easy when your team is trash. No one is fucking feeding you sweet dimes, no one is taking the attention of the defence off. You face constant double teams making it even HARDER in many ways to score. 

Yet players like Trae, booker, Towns,  etc are treated as if they don’t deserve to be all stars on the Basis that they have shit teammates.
