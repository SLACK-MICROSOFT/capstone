I’m Dylan Scott, health care policy reporter at Vox and co-author of the [VoxCare newsletter](http://vox.com/voxcare). Last fall, I traveled the world to explore what the US can learn from other countries’ health systems. During my time at Vox, I’ve covered Obamacare repeal, the Democratic debate over Medicare-for-all, and the 2020 election.

You hear it all the time: American health care spends more money and produces worse outcomes than many other developed countries’ systems. But why? What have other countries done to achieve universal health care, to cover everybody, that the United States has not? [And what are the consequences of those choices?](http://vox.com/covered) 

To answer these questions, Vox reporters [traveled to see other health systems](http://vox.com/covered) in action, talking with doctors, patients, and government officials to get the full and often complex picture. Our new reporting series, Everybody Covered, takes a closer look at a single-payer plan in Taiwan, a private-public hybrid in Australia, supercharged Obamacare in the Netherlands, the vaunted National Health Service of Great Britain, and an innovative hospital budgeting scheme right here in Maryland. Our project was made possible by a grant from The Commonwealth Fund.

[Proof!](https://twitter.com/dylanlscott/status/1221923012716498944) 

Have questions about my reporting or what the US can learn from other countries' health care systems? AMA!

The full Senate is now afforded a 16 hour period of time, spread over two days, to submit questions regarding Impeachment. Questions will be submitted to the House Managers or Trump’s defense team in writing, through Chief Justice Roberts, and will alternate between parties. The Senate session is scheduled to begin at 1pm EST.

Prosecuting the House’s case will be a team of seven Democratic House Managers, named by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff of California. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, are expected to take the lead in arguing the President’s case. Kenneth Star and Alan Dershowitz are expected to fill supporting roles.

The Senate Impeachment Trial is following the [Rules Resolution](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6662609/McConnell-Organizing-Resolution-for-Senate-Trial.pdf) that was voted on, and passed, on Monday. It provides the guideline for how the trial is handled. All proposed amendments from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) were voted down.  

The adopted Resolution will: 

* Give the House Impeachment Managers 24 hours, over a 3 day period, to present opening arguments. 

* Give President Trump's legal team 24 hours, over a 3 day period, to present opening arguments. 

* Allow a period of 16 hours for Senator questions, to be addressed through Supreme Court Justice John Roberts. 

* Allow for a vote on a motion to consider the subpoena of witnesses or documents once opening arguments and questions are complete.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Says GOP Lacks Votes To Block Impeachment Witnesses,54983,eveu8u,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/eveu8u/megathread_sen_majority_leader_mitch_mcconnell/,9561,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told senators privately Tuesday he does not yet have the votes to block new witnesses in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial.

McConnell convened a closed-door meeting of GOP senators shortly after Trump’s legal team made its closing arguments in the trial, the third and final day of defense proceedings punctuated by revelations from John Bolton, the former national security adviser. A Republican familiar with the meeting was not authorized to describe it by name and requested anonymity.

The GOP leader faced a handful of potential defections, but several days remained before any potential witness vote would be taken.

A decision to call more witnesses would need 51 votes to pass. With a 53-seat majority, Republicans can only afford to lose three Republicans to prevent more debate over witnesses.

This will be the defense’s final session. Per C-Span ""Other legislative business is also possible"" today. The Senate session is scheduled to begin at 1pm EST

Prosecuting the House’s case will be a team of seven Democratic House Managers, named last week by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff of California. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, are expected to take the lead in arguing the President’s case. Kenneth Star and Alan Dershowitz are expected to fill supporting roles.

The Senate Impeachment Trial is following the [Rules Resolution](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6662609/McConnell-Organizing-Resolution-for-Senate-Trial.pdf) that was voted on, and passed, on Monday. It provides the guideline for how the trial is handled. All proposed amendments from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) were voted down.  

The adopted Resolution will: 

* Give the House Impeachment Managers 24 hours, over a 3 day period, to present opening arguments. 

* Give President Trump's legal team 24 hours, over a 3 day period, to present opening arguments. 

* Allow a period of 16 hours for Senator questions, to be addressed through Supreme Court Justice John Roberts. 

* Allow for a vote on a motion to consider the subpoena of witnesses or documents once opening arguments and questions are complete.
