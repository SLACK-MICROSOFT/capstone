0,"Yes, it will work.   Just make sure you power the riser with the same PSU as you are powering the card with.   Six pin riser cards or adapter cables are required. 

Did i mention power the riser with the same  PSU?  Yes. 

If you have any cards plugged directly into 16x slots on there mobo do NOT use an asic PSU, use the same one that is powering your mobo."
1,"Yes you can, in my case for some reasons I need to power my gpus before everything else to make it work"
2,What is the reason for this?
3,Does this also apply if you have the power supplies tied together so that they both turn on when you turn on the PC? Or just to the power supply OP is talking about since it will always be on when you turn it on?
4,Confirmed. Always turn on your extra power supply first then your motherboard PSU.
5,"I'm not equipped to explain the specifics.  Read up on it when i was setting up my multi-PSU mining rigs but the knowledge has since left me.  

Generally speaking, the unused current leaving the PSU must return to that PSU (the positive and negative terminals).  If you have current leaving one PSU and entering another, it causes problems."
6,"Yes, it always applies.  Do NOT power the same piece with multiple PSUs."
7,"Def 2070, better hash rate and less power."
8,"in a few years a 2070 super will be worth around $200 or less. the key is how much you pay for power. i do not pay for my electricity, so for me cost vs hash power vs selling value is the sole consideration.

last year i sold 6 gtx 1070s for over $400 each and bought 12 used rx 580s for $200 or less each. a year later i have mined considerably more coin on those 12 than i would have, and have 12 cards worth about $120 each vs having 6 cards worth about $200 each.

if i were paying for power, the 1070s may have been the better move. for me, right now, a $90 used r9 fury is some of the best bang for buck out there, or used 580s because the $$ investment per hash is cheaper than newer, more powerful cards, and they depreciate much slower than newer cards.

i would personally buy used for sure. no sense paying a premium on something with a bloated ""new item"" price tag on it anyway."
9,Don't 1660Tis have a higher hash/watts ratio than 2070 Supers and every other card?
10,"> the 2070 Super will be more future proof with 8 gb of RAM, would sell better in a few years, and would not fill up my case as quickly. Do I go for resale value and future-proofing 

This one."
11,Definitely 2070 super. But I would look on the used market and maybe try to find one $450 or less. They are still new cards so it might be difficult to find one but this is definitely a better card than 1060tis
12,The 2060 super also has 8gb
13,Either 2070 super or just buy used gpus like another comment said. Def not 1660ti though
14,Thanks for the advice!  Unfortunately my power cost is around 0.09 cents per kwh.  I will also try to find something on the used market.  I think that I will take your word and go with the 2070 super.
15,Appreciated!  I will try and find something on the used market.
16,My problem though is that I can't buy two of those cards and I would still have an extra $100 that I couldn't use if I were to get one.  I also would not get quite the performance.  If you have a good solution though I would love to hear it!
17,Why not 1660Ti?
18,"at that power costs you won't make much of any profit after power, if you are choosing to GPU mine then you should look at mining as a way to subsidize the cost of your gaming rig, not a way to get rich. There is simply no real profit to be made, the cards depreciate faster then you earn back the purchase price."
19,"you should have been mining ETC with those, not XMR.  They were equally useless on CNR."
20,Eth
21,ETC or Eth. Maybe Zcash but haven't looked at Zcash for some time now!
22,"been useless for a long time, should have sold them before the randomX fork caused a flood of these garbage cards."
23,"I have read about having one GPU in the rig which has 4GB + of VRAM, makes other cards with less than 4GB of VRAM capable of mining ETH. Have not tested it though..."
24,"I hear ya. I sold off all my ""good stuff"" beginning of the year, and was down to just let my leftover 2GB 460s/550s run til they died as CN specific miners.

Was glad for the extra month they could run due to fork delay, but landscape of trying to find a semi-profitable CN shitcoin to put them on instead definitely suggests I should pull the plug on them for good. They'd only fetch like $30 on eBay, and after probably $25 is fees and shipping, that essentially means I may as well just chuck them.

Been mining for a few years, so certainly made my profit and it's not like I need to stay running, but RX definitely put a kink into my plans of running til the wheels fell off."

26,"""I made a bad investment decision! I hate you for accidentally indirectly causing my loss!""

&#x200B;

Er... don't get me wrong - you have the right to complain about anything, no matter how ridiculous... I still can't just **not** point out how unreasonable and honestly somewhat bemusing this post comes across."
27,2gb cards. CNR is what was left
28,2gb
29,"No offense but please read, 2gb cards cant be used on eth algo. Zcash is ass"
30,Theyre worthless regardless. Paid next to nothing for them in the first place
31,I dont see how as eth fundamentally works on loading the dag in every gpu.
32,Thats 100% where im at
33,"Instead of chucking. I would pay shipping at least. I would take a package deal if you have very many. I'm not rich. So too many would be no go. Let me know if you do decide to not want them. I can give them a warm home. Plus they heat my RV ""windows-style""."
34,So what now as far as GPU mining?
35,I dont have any ryzen. Dont plan on it
36,Nah bought a couple of years ago and payed less than $30 a card and ran up until randomx. Just saying that they have nearly no use now
37,F. Try sumokoin. Still on cn/r and for some reason its worth something
38,"Non taken. There's got to be some coins to mine with 2 gb still... Maybe not sheesh!!!

 I have been rocking 4gb and 8 gb so long now. 4 gb is next on the chopping block."
39,"Well, this is fair, don't get me wrong! Just... ohgod, as stated without context, it sounds hilarious."
40,Barely. Only alive again because xmr swapped. It was all but dead
41,"There is some, very few though."
42,"That was my intention. Mainly to spark responses and see what others are doing, the few of us using these cards lol"
43,Yeah. I held 10% of the total network hashrate for a couple months for shits and giggles
44,what about cn-gpu?
45,No good coins on it that I'm aware of
46,"i ran across it mining randomx on my ryzen but looked at the ryo currency hashrate conversion to btc to compare to eth mining on my GPUs and it looked like about 90%, so i thought it had potential. i could very well be wrong though. at a glance i saw tradeogre had ryo exchange, but again didn’t really look much further than that. had never heard of that exchange before."
47,"Some latest 590 have very bad stock memory timings, this variety because of different memory batches"
48,"I had nothing but issues with the gigabyte cards I started with, wouldn't go above 24 MH no matter what I did (580). My advice? Sell it, and never buy a windforce again."
49,Did you buy brand new? You could test some gaming benchmarks and see if you get better performance of the 580 there too. Not sure if there’s any relevance there since your strictly mining but you can always RMA or refund if it’s brand new I think.
50,this sucks... very bad news to hear this
51,damn.
52,"strange i have a couple rigs of 1660tis, asus and gigabyte and the gigabyte are much better than the asus ones, although a bit hotter"
53,"I will think about it. But last I had was Asrock 580, which is a heater, and an airplane turbine. Noisy. I will think if I will do with 27.5 MH/s, but this is really bad news."
54,When I bought a 2700x a while back they sent me a chip with a bunch of scratches and bent prongs and I had to RMA it. This was the anniversary Ed. 2700x. Sometimes it’s just the way things go and if you think you have a bad card make a claim or try to get a refund!
55,"Tbh I just think for now it's either non-optimal drivers for this particular card, or basically a low quality product itself, being that it was a bargain of a price at which I got it brand new. But I'm leaning towards it being more of a driver issue, since I rather trust Gigabyte, and this is ""Revision 2.0"" of this particular GPU, which is apparently worldwide-new. I don't think I'm going to be asking for a refund or change of card, because I think it might be possible to optimize it in the future, with suitable drivers, and possibly, modding the BIOS with PBE, which is apparently only beginning to be supported for the RX 590s. My only hope is AMD wouldn't completely throw out the course Polaris' cards in pose of their newcoming cards. By this I mean I'm keeping my fingers crossed they will eventually come up with a good driver, and PBE will support this particular kind of Samsung VRAMs (K4G80325FC) which are in these new Gigabyte cards. Thanks for the heads up, though."
56,Why would you have concerns? RTX isnt even used in mining. Of course it will work. Hell you can combine AMD and Nvidia cards in the same system and it will STILL work fine.
57,"Mix and match whatever you want, even AMD and Nvidia."
58,"I've got a mix of some 2070's and 1070's, no issues at all. As mentioned it uses the same drivers, so there are no conflicts possible."
59,"I had to tweak bios to get 1660tis to work with 1070s and running Amds and nvidias is a bit tricky, I tried for awhile a while back. Before I picked up a rtx just wanted to ask if I can expect any surprises, good to know I should not, thanks!"
60,"Yes it's perfectly fine. It uses the same drivers from Nvidia, so no extra difficulty to expect for maintenance, updates, etc., compared to a GTX-only rig."
61,That's a real good question to ask .  What OS and what GPUs ?
62,Whats wrong with mining using RTX cards?
63,"Yeah but is it ok if I use cards from different companies? (eg. EVGA and MSI)!?!?! I don't want to lose my warranty!

&#x200B;

/s"
64,Perfect thanks for the clarification
65,Cant you just setup a linux system with kvm to 2 vms with the gpus in passtrough? Amd to amd vm and nvidia to nvidia vm soe thing like that.
66,Nothing. He just meant that specifically the RTX cores in the GPU aren't used for mining.
67,Dude i use amd and nvidia in same rig. So everuthing is fine with mix of rtx and gtx
68,Companies can not tell what other components are in your system.
69,Thank you
70,Obviously.

72,"The 2070 might be worth it, depending on your electricity costs. The other stuff, not a chance."
73,"The 950 and 760 isnt going to be much value out of. The 2070 would be alot more value. If you want to mine you want to look at 2 things. 1. Profitability and just sell after you mine the coin. 2. Mine the coin even if it isnt profitable and hold it and wait. We are in the bear marked wich mean this is just the beginning of crypto currency. 
Go to what to mine.com and look what coins yoy can mine. You should not take anyones advice but I suggest you to mine Ethereum. Ethereum is a stable coin and many other miners mine it. 
DM me and I can help you even more with stuff :)"
74,"just dial the time back three years and it will both with electricity, effort and time"
75,Short answer...no.
76,"Ok, so I was able to figure out my kwh for my electric is .09, from what I've been able to kinda figure out on my own supposedly grin is a good coin to mine, I got a grin miner running at something like 5.08gps (last I checked) for my rtx 2070 and my server is on grinmint....I dunno if this is good or not, my gps according to grinmint keeps going up as it's only been running for half an hour so far, gonna leave it run overnight see what happens, I tried nicehash on my gtx 760 because I didnt realize it was in my main rig already just to see what would happen and it looks like it was getting .01 cents a day lol. Please any suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated."
77,"I kinda thought that might be the case, but I just figured the more the merrier lol. I tried to use nicehash a week ago on my 2070 and it was only showing like 40 cents a day at 100% utilization on cpu and gpu and that seemed kinda low, so I figured I'd ask reddit for advice"
78,"> even if it isnt profitable

then just BUY the damn coin so you get more of the coin so regardless of what happens to the coin value you make or lose less when you sell.

also you don't know what a Stable Coin is if you think Ethereum is a stable coin."
79,"I'm a fan of awesome miner, use it and Miningpoolhub, Nicehash, and a custom pool for Grin. Let it switch to whatever is most profitable after benchmarking all algos. Your main computer CPU and GPU could be profitable.

Could be fun to do the same with the other hardware, you can put the cost of electricity into awesome miner and if something isn't profitable, turn it off."
80,"Nah, that's about right. There's still money to be made but it's a lot harder now than it used to be. If you're really interested in it you're much better off taking the money you'd otherwise spend on mining equipment and investing it in btc."
81,"if you aren't using your old gear you might consider trying to sell it while you can. 

last month i sold some spare parts I had lying around. i5 4690k, AsRock z97 extreme6 mobo, 8gb of DDR3 stable OC to 2666mhz, for $250. I then went to the local microcenter to buy a $159 Ryzen 7 2700x, but they had that for $129. I ended up with a ryzen 7 2700x, gigabyte b450 aorus pro wifi itx mobo, and 16gb of 3200mhz DDR 4 for $270.   
Traded way up and bought myself upgrade ability for $20.... side bonus, the ryzen 7 2700x mines randomx at 5kh/s at stock, at a lower power draw than a gpu. I have flat rate electricity, so I do mine my rx 580 that is in that machine with it, they combine for nearly .90 a day. rx 580 is still a great bang for buck card if you mod it to overclock on significantly lower power draw, given the low price ($120 or less used on ebay) and lower depreciation than newer cards.

I have another spare machine that is i7 4790k, same asrock z97 extreme6 mobo, same 8gb ram. i'll be selling that combo, for more money, and doing the same thing most likely. might do a 3000 series ryzen since the 2700x is back to $159. Maybe Ryzen 5 3600x for $199. We'll see. I'm not upgrading stuff to mine, but I will mine with the stuff I upgrade."

90,"something with GDDR6 and the most powerful you can afford in your budget, honestly GPU mining is dying, the last hope for profitability is the ProgPOW fork for Ethereum in Q1 of next year (so inside the next 4 months) after that you will need stupid cheap power to even break even unless some legitimately useful new coin comes along,"
91,If its just for mining I think I saw a Radeon 7 for 500 bucks somewhere.
92,"Nvidia, maybe a 2070S if you want to game as well"
93,"If you dont have a big bugget I'd go with 2-3 highest end cards like 2080 or 2080ti rather then 5 2060s / 2070s.

If you decide you don't want to mine any more you'll have awesome card for gaming, and if you want to sell them again it's easier to sell 2 or 3 cards then 6."
94,"If your electric cost is high go 1660 Ti or 1660 Super. If not, 2070 Super is the best."
95,"You know. you could buy like 1.5 eth for a graphics card. I know the spirit of this sub is for fun and hobbyists, but i cant tell someone to buy cards when overall, its prob more profitable to HODL."
96,"Price to performance gets lower and lower as you get to the higher end cards. Price to performance (for Nvidia) is best at the 1660, but still decent at a 2060. But any higher and it drops off."
97,I completely understand. I have some ETH already... just have a lonely empty rig shell sitting here lol
98,"Just curious, I have a GTX 970 and free electricity (I did not buy it for mining, so I'm not in the hole at all for anything). What would make the most profit for my GPU?"
99,"I did Folding, but not just to do folding, there is/was a project called Banano that paid you in BAN for folding that was profitable for a time several months ago, for a few weeks it was more profitable then mining by a decent amount at that time but as people learned about it the profits dropped super fast and I went back to regular mining."

101,I run a Golem node (https://golem.network/)
102,Put that ryzen on xmr+x while it's hot
103,Xmr+x is very profitable right know. It will go down in time pm me for a link
104,Cool! Do you make a lot from it compared to other coins or is it not that profitable?
105,How much do you think I could make in a month running it 24/7? I thought CPU mining was completely dead
106,"Not a lot yet b/c Golem is still in beta.  As the Task API is released on the mainnet and more use cases come onboard, that's when earnings will go up.  But it doesn't really cost anything to run it in the background.  Only when the node receives a subtask does it do work and get paid."
107,CPU mining came back Saturday afternoon after XMR forked to RandomX
108,"I believe PoW algos (both CPU and GPU) will continue to exist for a while. A lot of projects have no intent to switch to PoS anytime soon, or are even totally opposed to it (Monero, Ycash...).

As long as there's miners, there will be PoW."
109,Maybe throw my GPU’s off the cliff side while downing a few cold ones would give me some enjoyment. Sure easier then trying to sell them. 😂
110,What are you gonna do with your crystal ball?! I'm assuming you've got one - as you seem to know the future with such certainty!
111,"the same thing I did the last month, sit on my crypto with my computers converting my DVD/Bluray collection."
112,Video cards are the easiest components to sell
113,You have to admit PoW is wasteful. PoS seems like an advancement and it's only a matter of time.
114,hell yeah. I assume to play on chrome cast?
115,Yea I agree they are easy to sell I was just joking about throwing them off a cliff. Realistically I’m the sort of person I will run mine until they die as long as they turn a profit.
116,"PoW is quite wasteful - yet it's sorta the ""gold standard"" for cryptocurrency security for good reasons. PoS has been plagued with exploits and issues ever since the idea was introduced - besides, even ignoring all of this... part of the functionality provided by PoW is to initially distribute the currency! Without PoW... it's an ICO launch: a pre-mine with a pre-dump."
117,"nah, i've got 2 10TB hard drives in my gaming rig and i've got an Nvidia Shield TV that has Kodi installed on it with a Network Map to the Video folder on 1 of the 2 10 TB drives, also can put Kodi on most of my other streaming devices for the other TV's in the house so my gaming desktop doubles as a media server/NAS."
118,Nice! What are you mining?
119,Nice work mate! What are you mining and what's the current per hour ROI on your rig?
120,Thank you!! It's only the second full size rig I have built. The other one were 3 card rigs. This one does about 3.25 a day. Mining ether classic on ethermine. Just got a new refurbished 1070ti to add to it
121,Mining ether classic on ethermine
122," I have input for the PSU question.  
I have used 5 or 6 gold/plat PSU's in the past couple years and one PSU stood out beyond the rest for mining applications.  
The Enermax Platimax 850w Platinum , which i paid 200Cad for a couple years ago, is the best.

It  comes with more ports for 2+6pins, and while stock it comes with cables  for 6x 8pin, you can buy another cable for 20$ online and get a 4th set  on it. I can't stress how amazing that is, because without it,  3x1070ti's pull 125w each and doesnt even get close to 80%ing the 850w  range, even with the mobo on it. It was the only 850 capable of 4x8pin.  
The  next better thing about the Enermax over comparable plats like my  thermaltake 850 plat or the seagate 850 plat, is the power is split into  4 rails, instead of the 1 or two used by the others. This means a more  stable power wave when used by multiple cards. Mucho greatness. The  others are good, but not as good as this one.  
Not sure how much it's  worth now, or even if there is a gold version for 100$ somewhere, but  this Enermax was superior than the others."
123,"Where can I find a small HDMI compatible screen to just plug in when something goes wrong on my rig, SO sick of setting up a big screen and switching HDMI cables all day long.

133,Oh ok! I am interested in selling as it so happens. Please PM me!
134,What version of nvidia inspector. not sure if they made new version to set fan speed on GTX 1660. I think my MSI wont work. you might need to have MSI afterburner or another set the fan speeds and then use nvidia to set your clocks
135,Are you also mining xmr with the cpu?
136,Yessir!! The CPU mines random X
137,Total daily profit?
138,What's your ROI so far?
139,It's not to hot my man.. total after electric is about 3 bucks. The Nvidia rig does a little better. But I'm only paying a little less than 8cents a kw/h
140,I assume this is not a dedicated mining rig? Your components seems to provide a glistening experience.
141,No.. it's dedicated 24/7. It's just parts from a bunch of other mining rigs and other PC's that I build.  I trade from home so I have lots of PC parts and etc laying around..
142,Ya man. It doesn't hash that much. But it adds to the overall $$
143,What do you mine? ETH?
144,"Yeah mostly ETH and classic. I have 2 other GPU rigs. I will post pics. The other one is Nvidia rig. That one mines Beam ,RVN and I mine on nicehash as well. You can actually post a nice profit mining on NH ."
145,Looks great! What do you mine and what hashrate do you get?
146,Is this rig profitable? Is that possible? Also how loud is it? Thanks!
147,Nice rig man!!
148,"8 x 8GB rx470 blowers. Using asrock h110 with 2 x 750W EVGA G2 PSUs.

Everything undervolted as low as possible at 800-825mv. 1050mhz core and 1950 mem yield 231MH at 550W (reported in HiveOS so take that as you will I think it’s closer to 700W).

I’ve run a few of these builds on just a singular 1300W EVGA with PCI-e splitters successfully as well."
149,Just mining ETH heavily undervolted. 231MH per rig I have 9 of these.
150,"Depends on your electric rate. I pay the equivalent of 8.5cents USD so it’s still marginally profitable.

My strategy is to not sell mined coins to pay for power, I just convert my fiat into crypto at the discounted rate with every hydro bill."
151,That's the main reason I am interested in building a rig. Even if I break even I would rather mine my own coins then give my information to an exchange. But electricity is about 11.5 cents usd here so rip.
152,"if i may ask, did you start with capital? looks like a huge and rapid operation (you had me at ""100's of GPUs per week"""
153,Actually quite an amazing journey.
154,"Wow.. that's some real dedication to mining..

When did this all happen?

160,Hell yeah man thanks for sharing
161,How many GPUs do you have going now? What's your power draw and electricity cost? What's your strategy for turning the crypto into capital?
162,"Great video, thanks for sharing your story and insights.
One recommendation though. If you could add approximate time periods to your development progress, pictures and videos, that would be great.
Also follow up for years 18/19 and your plans for future would be very interesting to hear about. 
Certainly subscribed, again thanks for sharing your story."
163,pure awesome.. thx for sharing
164,"Liked, Commented!"
165,How do you not pay for electricity?
166,"Not OP, but profitability depends mostly on how cheap you can buy the electricity.  
In some parts of US / Canada it is profitable, however good luck having it profitable in Germany or other developed European countries."
167,must be included in the lease
168,Yeah in my country its 14cents euro per kw....whats the lowest cost go bd proftabld?
169,".04 here...  .06 winter rates 3 months a year.  50 gpus running, not losing money but even at these rates it's still a waste to start now.  I only do it because it's already running on autopilot."
170,"Depends on your hardware and algo, but I would say it's around $0.1 / kwh.   
Your 14cents euro per kwh would be profitable if it offsets the heating costs, assuming you would do it using the standard electric heater."
171,"Having .18 here, had to turn off most of the rigs, sporadically turn them on if my heat pump doesn't catch up with minus temperatures, as it's still cheaper to heat with rigs than with direct electricity.Waiting for the rate change to .09, so it won't be much profitable, but at least I won't be losing money... as the free heat that comes with it will have my heating bill reduced significantly."
172,Nice fix
173,"Nice fix! 

Anyone can recommend a website to buy the replacement fans on AMD’s  RX480 570 580?"
174,Nice fix!!
175,Fan of zotac gtx 970 in my gaming PC died 2 times in warranty.
176,Thankfully none of the 3 fans on my Zotac 1070 have died yet..
177,"I was thinking on taking the cover off my 2070 mini , they dont seem to pull enough air and if you pay attention the cover blocks the sides from getting air or pushing air out"
178,"I don't know about Zotac, but what I do know is that ASUS GPU fans are the worst. At least their STRIX models. Sapphire and Gigabyte tend to have the highest quality fans. Out of my 30 Sapphire cards, 60 ASUS GPUs and 40 Gigabyte ones, 6/120 ASUS fans failed in 6 months. For Sapphire it was 1/60 and it was 0/40 for Gigabyte.

An industry insider also told me that ASUS's company culture is all about cutting costs and taking the cheap way out on the fans and PCB components. I have no idea why their reputation is so good among gamers."
179,"Put them in proper cases, no GPU fans necessary"
180,Just take off the fan that is bad and on the back there is a model #. Just search off of that.
181,Amazon or ebay
182,What did they do for you? Just send out fans?
183,you find them on aliexpress cheap
184,Good to know that there’s a model number in the back of fans! Tks bud!
185,No. They replaced the GPU.
186,How will you mine anything at $0.20/kWh? You want to be at $0.05 for ASICs and $0.09 for GPUs.
187,Dont think anyone or anything is profitable at 0.2 CHF. You are barely gaining something at 0.1
188,I would be interested but only if you get an industrial contract with EWZ or whoever for around 0.1 CHF per KWh. Otherwise it is better to leave my miner in my basement ;)
189,Negative electricity costs?

227,"Downloaded and registered, looks fairly intuitive. You've put a lot of work into it so kudos on that front.  Couple questions:   
1) do you/will you have a client for a non-dedicated rig (i.e. like a normal work desktop (WIN, Mac) used for office purposes?  
2) Profit switching (maybe I'm looking in the wrong place?)  
3) Hidden fees or ability to change dev fee rates?   


Looks a lot like HIVE, $2/instance is same as HIVE. We have a hybrid environment: 1) dedicated rigs, 2) office machines, and 3) dual CPU servers (for XMR). With your current subscription plan offering, this type of hybrid config would not be profitable for us. (maybe we're not your target market?) IOW, we're interested in your OS due to the issues you say you solve (heat, CPU efficiency, etc) so would like to hear more. Thanks in Advance."
228,"Looks great, but you are about 3 years late"
229,"It's our own Linux distribution. It's supper light and very efficient. It also fixes a lot of issues you run into trying to mine on other Linux OS or windows.

As for switching, we have a mass installation tool that let's you easily swap over multiple rigs to our OS all at once."

232,Yep
233,"Things Hashr8OS does different than other mining operating systems:

- price
- temperature
- wattage
- built in tools
- RTX/GTX mixed rig fan control
- mining software updates w/o a new image
- install size
- load average 
- mobile applications
- live customer support community"
234,"Answers below:
1.) Windows client coming soon. In testing right now.
2.) Profit switching will come in 3 ways. 1 pools that currently support it 2 nice hash support. Those are already supported. 3 is an in house built switcher we do not have open to the public yet.
3.) Mining software (Eg gminer, trex, etc) have their own dev fees and we prefer to allow them to collect those fees to continue their great dev work. Those fees are clearly laid out on those developers sites, we do not control them.

Hive is $3 per rig per month. Hashr8 OS is only $2. You also get 3 rigs free. 

We also have reduced dev fees for ASIC software (not the right community to talk ASICs though)"
235,"In 3 years you can make a ton of improvements.

It runs cooler and lighter (1GB total size) uses less electricity at the wall, has more features, an active community, and a dev team willing to work with miners to add just about anything they want."

Sorry about any confusion."
242,"There are still issues with RTX/GTX fan control on mixed rigs to my knowledge, we have users switching to our OS just to better manage those rigs. 

Most other Mining OSs are built on top of Ubuntu. This makes it about a 7GB install and uses way more CPU even when sitting idol. 

We custom built our Linux distribution to address this and other known memory leaks. This allows for an extremely low load average while mining with let's the CPU sit near idol reducing wattage used by the system at the wall. Anywhere from 10-50 watts per rig depending on your setup. Our total install is about 1GB. 

We are seeing rigs run 10%-20% cooler on our OS at the same hashrate do to kernel improvements and reduced waste heat from other componets. 

Our OS allows for new miners to be downloaded to the image without having to do a full OS upgrade. This is different, and it also allows for you to only have the miners you use installed on your device. 

We have a full working IOS and Android mobile application that includes push notifications for easier hands off management of rigs. 

It's 30% cheaper for miners with more than 3 rigs. 

If you want to see what it does differently or see what else the community has pointed out go check it out. This is just our first release. We have a ton more stuff coming in the next few weeks/months all of which will make it even more obvious what separates us from other mining OS.

There are 3rd party security reviews on a regular basis and results will be posted in the future.

266,"I'm not an expert, but have had many people tell me in various forums and such that they're totally useless for this type of operation."
267,Not at this time I believe. Maybe mining software will be able to make use of them in the future.
268,It would be up to the miner dev's.. if T-REX could find a way to get the RT cores to maybe run a smaller computer chain on the side to just supplement the hash rate or something that would be ***something***. But for all we know they aren't capable of that. iirc there is an algorithm or two that can use/utilize tensor but I'm not 100% sure if its the same thing either.
269,"NOPE, there was Raycoin that used the RT cores but someone posted just a day or so back about that one being dead, so being there are no algorithms designed to use those cores in operation today and you can't just use them for normal calculations, they ""think"" differently so you can't use them for what you use normal cores for, if you could someone would have done it by now."
270,"It's really up to the coder's capabilities, there's an art to thinking in terms of integer compute operations as oppose to FP.  Especially when converting existing algos to integer ops."
271,"Raytracing is a gimmick, all around"
272,Does SHA256 use FP32?
273,It's not likely that another coin will be made with ray tracing in mind since you can easily make ASICs to do it. I'm pretty sure that RTX cards have small ASICs for their ray tracing but that would pale in comparison to a complete card dedicated to ray tracing. If you want an example of this being done I'm pretty sure Disney uses ASICs for ray tracing in animations and CGI in their films.
274,well Raycoin was the only one I knew of.

309,"Gotta do some research on what kind of amperage and wattage wires support. It is very easy to melt wires or outlets. 

The turning point for me was a burning plastic smell and a scorched plug. Ordered a 5.8kw PDU and wired up a 240v outlet. Regular outlets are too limiting in terms of how much hardware you can run on them. It can be potentially catastrophic if you are using multiple outlets are they are on the same breaker."
310,Prehaps you used a left over monitor cord instead of the original PSU cord?  Not all of those style cords are rated for the full amperage a mining PSU can draw.
311,"I had a power cable melt in half before, saw it sparking on my floor. Glad you caught it before it was any worse off!"
312,Wow. Thanks for sharing. I better go check all my shit
313,Ouch
314,"Yes only run at 80% of Max capacity.  That goes for your psu, pdu and the circuit they are plugged into.  If you push past 80% on the circuit (120v or 240v) the insulation on the wiring can begin to melt just like in your picture, but then it'll be the wiring in the house / data center that is melting."
315,"Had the same thing happen a while back on my 1070/1050ti rig! Didn't realize until the PC (luckily) crashed on its own when I wasn't home. Even worse, the power supply broke from the force needed to pull the cable out. Still not exactly sure what caused it, but now I check the cable from time to time."
316,"This is a great example of why you should always check your rigs.  I mean this could have been caught when OP took the rig down to clean it, if they took them outside to use an air can and spray all that fine dust outside."
317,"wow, got melted working at 110v or 220v?"
318,Mmm toasty
319,Get yourself a 14AWG cable instead. Shouldn't be more than $10. Even if you are technically running within the limits of this cable (which I don't think you are with 6x 1070's) most consumer stuff is not rated to be run 24/7 at its maximum. Never exceed 80% of the rated load of anything.
320,"> on what kind of amperage and wattage wires support. It is very easy to melt wires or outlets.

Regular outlets are too limiting in terms of how much hardware you can run on them. It can be potentially catastrophic if you are using multiple outlets are they are on the sam

I think most older household outlets in the US are wired for 15A, so 110V \* 15A = 1650 watts. Although I think you'll push your luck anywhere above 1450 watts. In the EU 230V @ 15A = 3450 watts"
321,The cable was the same cable that came with the power supply from 3 years ago.
322,i agree. i live in a 1960s wired house. that was check and updated in the 80s in fl....
323,"The text 18AWGX3C is visible in the photo, which would suggest 18AWG wires inside the cable.

18AWG would according to https://www.stayonline.com/product-resources/reference-circuit-ampacity.asp suggest that it would be able to carry 10A.

Also the IEC 60320 C13 connector (the one which is burnt in the photo) is supposed to handle a maximum current of 10A.

Since the other end of the cable looks like an NEMA connector I'm going to assume US and 120V nominal mains voltage bit with 10% tolerance that would end up being in the range of 108-132V.

So based on the standard tolerances you would not expect the cable and connector to withstand more than a maximum of 108V*10A = 1080W.

And since power supplies are not 100% efficient, there has to be a bit more derating, for example the EVGA G3 specifies that it's minimum 90% efficient for 115VAC input, using these numbers we get 1080W*90% = 972W maximum power for the DC side of the power supply.

A GTX1070 seems to have a default power limit of around 150W, so if all 6 GPUs in the rig were maxing out then 900W would be needed for only the GPUs, + a bit of extra for mobo+cpu+ssd, an estimate would be in the interval of 50-100W for that.

These numbers sum up to an expected power usage of 950-1000W on the DC side of your powersupply, which with 90% efficiency becomes 1056-1111W on the AC side. Which is right around the maximum the cable and connector are rated for."
324,110v
325,What power supply?
326,"> Also the IEC 60320 C13 connector (the one which is burnt in the photo) is supposed to handle a maximum current of 10A.

You can use this connector for up to 16A (https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/1452), and that's the issue.  I've seen PSUs using C13 connectors with rated loads that are over 10A (@120V) and those come with cables also rated for 16A.

Based on your math he's marginal on whether or not it's an acceptable cable for the load.  It's definitely not oversized, that's for sure."
327,"Well, that explain the failure of the cable. If you can go for 220v for your rig it will be safer."

334,Try to increase your voltage slightly . If not most likley you ASIC cannot handle higher OC
335,Fact is that the default is 1750 how cant i get higher than 1325
336,Because you lowered the core voltage by 250 mV. My 5700 runs at 52 MH at 1300 core 798 mV with 910 on mem. Can’t go any higher than that on my card.

344,"where your money is going depends on how you configured Awesome Miner, when you installed Awesome Miner the first thing you should have done is configure it to mine to certain pools and if you aren't using profit switching pools then you configure it to mine a specific coin, from there you would go to the pool and check to see how close to a payout you are, depending on the pool you are using 24 hours likely isn't enough to see a payout on Grin given the minimum amounts you need at most pools, plus Grin is a strange one, unlike other coins where they can just send the coin to your wallet address and it shows up the next time you sync your wallet there is a whole bunch of hoops you have to jump through using these transaction file things.

Not sure what this ""Counselor"" thing you speak of is or what is going on that makes you think you made 15 MILLION DOLLARS in 1 day, there is only 37 Million Dollars worth of Grin in Existence today and that coin has been around for like a year, even if you had every GPU in the world you couldn't mine that much in 1 day from 1 coin."

354,I know it can be done but I gave it a shot about 6 months ago trying to put 2 RX 570s in with a 1070 rig and windows wouldn't properly pick up the 570s.
355,"works without any issues .. beside having the useless ""Radeon Settings"" at top position on the right-click-context menu in explorer .. a very annoying thing."
356,If you want to mix amd and nvidia gpus it might be best to setup Linux to mine. It handles mixed card rigs much better.
357,"Hey man, I'm running 5  590 8gb on Windows and I'm not having any issues. Nice cards the 590's
Big though"
358,They run pretty cool. Mine are doing 49 C.
359,"Not really a good idea to mix Nvidia and AMD cards in the same setup. 

You should go for two RTX. Less burden with drivers and mining software, easier to manage and optimize, less maintenance, more stability. 

Also Nvidia cards performs well on a wide range of algos while AMD cards don't."
360,Sorry.. the rx590's. They all run a few degrees of each other. No bios mods yet. Just overclocked
361,That's what I'm using . I bought 2 new ones of of Amazon and 3 more MSI ones off of eBay used for like 150 or so... Not to bad. Mining ether on ethermine
362,I'm not sure my man... I hope not. But only one rig I am running haveAMD. The rest are team green
363,"I'm looking at Sapphire Radeon RX 590 8GB Nitro+ Special Edition, if it matters. :)"
364,Which one?
365,"I thought AMD cards were better for mining, but worse for gaming."
366,"Is it true that AMD's VBIOS can be hacked, while nVidia's is encrypted?"
367,"Depends what you want to mine. AMD performs well for Ethash and RandomX but Nvidia does better in terms of efficiency (hash per watt) for almost any other algo, I believe."
368,Should be ok
369,I have a 1080ti in my everyday use desktop. I can mine on it and watch or steam videos perfectly fine.
370,"My 2070 can even handle light gaming while mining at around 25% to 50% of the nominal hashrate. Even runs CSGO at 4k with acceptable framerates. 
Can even run 4k video on YouTube perfectly. For 8k it stutters every couple of seconds"
371,I think GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER is best.
372,Any modern Nvidia card can do this fine.
373,Depends on MadVR settings. If you calibrate madvr with mining off starting a demanding video while mining will overload your card.
374,"I play video games while mining on my 1070TI, no problem."
375,"I'm talking about NVDEC, not shaders/hybrid decoding."
376,Oh indeed my bad. I'm guessing it won't affect it. At least for me there was no issue. I mostly used 1080p movies or bd50s
377,"from the first sight, it looks like a 10 fold building"
378,Looks good. What you mining?
379,Send me your old gpus 🤣
380,What cards are these?
381,9 gpus? what mobo and how stable is it?
382,"Nice, just did an RX 5700 build w/ 7 running @ \~110W each, haven't tested from the wall.  (can't get the 8th to pass DAG) \~350MH/s.  \*\*ONLY REASON I DID IT\*\* the blower style 5700s were cheap and it's getting cold out."
383,👍
384,or a jet engine of a primgrid
385,Just mining ETH at the moment!
386,470/570’s
387,Bio star tb250 works great with SMOS.
388,Any idea what your hashing at?
389,"I got similar overclocks with 580's hashing 29.5-30
Core 1120 memory 2050 volts 975"
390,252MH @860w
391,You should be at 33mhs each with claymore.
392,Nice mate. Appreciate you showing us your rig.
393,90 or less watts per card? What are your afterburner settings?
394,Using Phoenixminer...so I should switch to claymore?
395,"Running SMOS 800mv core, 1050mhz core, 1950 memory"
396,"Yes it has vram overclock profiles based on your memory type but requires you to flash back to stock. Also a feature called RX boost, I can only assume more memory optimizations, make sure rxboost 1 is added to the command line."
397,"Thank you sir, best of luck to you."
398,What’s your power limit?
399,"Stock. The voltage being 800mv keeps the wattage low.

It’s all about finding the best hash/watt."
400,Have to upgrade to claymore v15.0
401,use Phoenix Miner 4.7c or Claymore 15v that will resolve your issue.
402,"Thanks, I’ll try!"
403,"just remember it's just a stop gap at this point, only a matter of time before they become useless, especially if the Dev team keeps to their Q1 2020 ProgPOW fork promise."
404,"I thought ProgPOW will make GPU mining more profitable, as it will make GPUs have more advantage than ASICs. Can you ellaborate?"
405,"He probably try to said in case if you have AMD , since they aren't good at progpow , if you have seen or mine  BCI then you will notice this."
406,"ProgPOW heavily favors GDDR6 cards, a 2060 does DOUBLE the hashrate of a 570 4GB and then some and does so with a higher Mh/w see the charts here https://1stminingrig.com/whats-up-with-progpow-benchmarks-addressing-the-criticisms/#Nvidia_GPUs_ProgPow_Hashrate_Benchmarks

so newer GPU's are going to be significantly faster (an RX 570 and a 2060 pull very near the same performance on ETHash today) and more energy efficient while doing so, how profitable it will be for older cards depends entirely on how much of the current hashrate is coming from ASIC's.

You also have to factor in with the upcoming Monero fork (in less then 2 weeks) a SIGNIFICANT Number of GPU's (on the order of 100's of thousands of GPU's which are mostly AMD) will be forced elsewhere as Monero becomes no longer profitable to mine and those GPU's will have to go somewhere.

Yes ProgPOW should make mining more profitable but in the mean time it's gonna get a lot worse and when ProgPOW does come along there is gonna be a lot of hashrate looking for a home and so any profits there are to make with it will likely be short lived as with every other GPU supporting coin fork we've seen over the last 2 years, it only stays profitable until people hear about it and move their rigs over, at best (unless like 50%+ of Eth hashrate is coming from ASIC's) we will see 2 weeks of profitability before things drop back to where they are now."
407,"I wouldn't use FirstMining review, he missed key points in the AMD GPUs that resulted in lower hashrates. I was able to get higher hashrates due to just the weird way AMD drivers. See my review here  


[https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/comprehensive-progpow-benchmark-715126798476](https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/comprehensive-progpow-benchmark-715126798476)"
408,Claymore 15 fixed things and improved hashrates. Thanks for replies everyone.
409,"even then my point still stands, the 20 series Nvidia GPU's do nearly double the hash per watt and overall have a higher hash per dollar price of the GPU so my original point still stands even if the numbers where slightly off, we are still talking massive performance differences."
410,How can come determine if a GPU is C31 compatible?
411,How much different?  Say on a 1070 or 1080?
412,"you have enough VRAM, so 11GB or higher VRAM GPU's on Windows and 8GB VRAM GPU's on Linux"
413,we've noticed 50% in earnings increase from C29 and C31
414,Windows consumes more VRAM than Linux or what?
415,"YES, since like the 1709 or 1803 Windows 10 update Windows uses like half a gig or so of GPU VRAM, this is why 4GB cards are already losing the ability to mine Ethereum even though they should still have another year or so before the DAG file size pushes them out and this extra VRAM usage results in the 8GB cards not having enough available VRAM to do Grin31 even though Miner updates have been able to reduce the Grin31 VRAM requirements to under 8GB of available VRAM."
416,I used a shoe rack
417,Milk crate
418,That's brutally honest
419,So you have no intention of even holding the coins and are just planning to cash out to fiat?  How about I save you the hassle.  I'll give you $.50/day and in return you send me $1/day.  Outcome will be the same either way for you and at least one of us can make a little money on the side.
420,"There is almost no single GPU out there that will yield more than $1USD/day running the full 24 hours. The only two that get reasonably close are the Radeon VII and 2080 TI. The 2080 TI can do over $1/day on some coins at the moment. These boards are crazy expensive. In the realm of mining straight 24/7 for 2+ years before the card pays itself off not counting electricity. And this assumes no other hardware failures.

Sorry. I think you'd be best served with a used RX 570/580 that is flashed and configured for etherum mining. You'll make very little but it's efficient and a used board runs like $120 now. It'll at least get your foot in the door and be a great learning experience. From there you can decide if you want something a little more beefy."
421,"First, I would recommend you visit whattomine.com. This will give you a good understanding of profitability for a variety of cards. Of money isn't an option, there are high end cards like the Radeon 7 or the RTX 2080ti or 2070 super cards. Look into which algorithm the card is best at and go from there. You want to mine a coin and then exchange it to Bitcoin which will then be exchanged to Fiat by coinbase or something like that. A popular wallet is Exodus but based on the coin, you might need to get a different wallet. Visit miningpoolhub to get a list of pools for each coin and they can help you get started on how to program your  miner. aio miner is a good starting miner. It will help you learn the basics of mining programs but after a while, it might be better to download individual miners. But do your research and make your best guess. overall, do your research and choose a card that will give you the best return on investment time and good resale value after your done with it. Happy mining."
422,"First, check NiceHash profitability calculator: https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator

I recommend you using NiceHash(I work for NiceHash). I am confident to say that NiceHash Miner is the most profitable way to mine. Also, pretty simple. 

NiceHash works as a broker of hashing power. We connect buyers of hashing power and sellers(you). Buyers buy hashing power on the open marketplace, where they ""fight"" over hashrate. A lot of times, buyers are willing to pay more for an MH/s than that MH/s would earn if mining directly to pool. That is why, you earn more with NiceHash.

423,"Get 2070 Supers,

Get 2 risers and a pcie extension cable, run 4 cards for mining.

I'd recommend Hashr8 OS, Linux based, super light, full features to mine just about anything you want."
424,"Might as well pick up a FPGA(This isn't even worth it anymore even though its way more efficent and yield faster ROI).

GPU mining isn't worth it anymore. It hasn't been for a great while even in the spec-mining space."
425,"so you want to mine to fiat? fat chance. crypto is a buy/mine and hold asset. everyone saying ""its not profitable"" wants to live from the land without sprouting a seed. crypto holdings from mining are for retirement not for day to day living. this specially aplies to miners from 3rd world countries."
426,"OP, unfortunately this pretty much is the situation atm.  


Only times I recommend people GPU mine is if they have free electricity (and even then its usually a bit dubious) \*or\* more realistically, if they just \*want\* to - like they want to have the hardware around and stuff.  


You won't be making money doing this atm OP.  If you wanted to mine crypto for fun and hodl it well I'd say just go for it, cuz it is pretty cool - even though you'd probably be losing money - but in your situation honestly I'd say play your game and sell the GPU"
427,I believe manufacturers supply the best drivers.  They are specifically designed to run on their equipment.  Radeon is the drivers I use and they work just fine with nicehash.
428,19.5.2 is the version I am running.  Nicehash is probably the least stable miner I am aware of at this time.  Normally I use nanominer.
429,In theory you should be able to install older drivers.  Perhaps you would need to disable autoupdater somehow.  Generally speaking it is best to run current versions.  My suggestion is to just delete and reload drivers.
430,It has been noted that 8MB is the smallest acceptable ram for running mining programs.
431,Correction...  8GM.
432,"Delete drivers with DDU(Display Driver Uninstaller) then reinstall latest drivers.

For me, Code 43 usually showed up when I had a bad riser, bad power supply or driver issues"
433,"Are your cards BIOS-modded? If so, try running the ATI Pixel Clock patcher 1.4.7 to get windows to recognize your cards again. It'll tell you beforehand if it doesn't need to run and then you can at least rule this out https://sourceforge.net/projects/amd-ati-pixel-clock-patcher/"
434,"So I had it working when I was running and HOS and everything was discoverable and then last night when I installed my SST with windows on it and put nice hash onto it if found five of the eight cards. Then I updated the drivers went to bed while it was doing it was taking forever and I wake up to zero drivers I did get the re live mining drivers but I’m thinking of Rolling that back. Which ones are you running if you don’t mind me asking 19.11? 


Code 43 on 400 series only

435,Can I like backdate drivers just by doing a search or will that AMD driver updater let me find that specific one. They’re not being discovered either on Kudo and I haven’t had a chance to try Hive
436,I was thinking of doing that tonight and to be honest 4 GB ddr4 is way too slow on a celeron. I constantly feel like I am fighting with my minor to click anything
437," [https://hashr8.com/](https://hashr8.com/)    
Word on the street is that this is new hotness."
438,Any advice for how to update amd drivers? Still have not been able to successfully do it
439,To install latest AMD drivers run this command  hive-replace -y [http://download.hiveos.farm/hiveos-0.6-84@191022.zip](http://download.hiveos.farm/hiveos-0.6-84@191022.zip)
440,"Yes ETHASH is being weird for a few months now, every once and a while I see my Titan Xp's reach the 60+ Mh/s they should be doing then after a few minutes they drop back down to like 53-54 where my 1080ti's used to run at. Never bothered to trouble shoot it because either way I wouldn't make money over power costs at this point."
441,Yes. My cards lost 1-1.5 Mh each.
442,What are you mining? I know the RVN switch to x16rv2 resulted in about a 5% drop in hashrate because of the new algo.
443,Do you notice your GPU miner(s) using more CPU time by any chance? How is GPU utilization % versus the previous drivers you were using? Which driver version are you on now? Did you change anything else?
444,What are your MSI OC settings?
445,Nope
446,"I think Nvidia's newest drivers have caused some issues with miners. I noticed if I reboot a machine the rate goes back up to normal.

This generally has only effected windows machines. As an FYI."
447,Speaking of never bothering to troubleshoot.... you using ETHlargement or what? My Xps are pulling 42MH/s on ETHash
448,"Sorry, ethash. Oversight on my part"
449,I'm not sure I'd have to check on utilization. Using fairly old drivers though. Maybe worth a refresh. I just don't like to touch them if I don't have to.
450,"TDP ~80
Core 100
Memory 600
Fan 80

Core and Mem are as low as 0 and 450 on other rigs, respectively; had to feel them out individually. When things were humming, I had each of them running over 300 Mh/s (6x 1080 TI)."
451,i'm running several month old drivers at this point on the miner. so can't blame it on the latest drivers.
452,YES using Ethlargment
453,Use the -strap feature in claymore
454,"OK, I had issues with a recent nV driver, so I was curious. But all is well with the latest ""game ready"" driver, and the most recent ""studio"" one as well (for me at least). Thanks!"
455,"Are you on windows? Maybe it's the windows update. I noticed the same thing on a windows 10 rig. Was finicky figured it must be drivers, but gave up troubleshooting it and flipped it over to a Linux mining OS. Haven't had any issues sense."
456,Sorry I'm not familiar with that- can you elaborate a bit? I'll research online as well when I can
457,Okay thanks I'll give that a try
458,Windows 8.1 on this rig because I need 8.1 for my work software that I run on the rig. But I see it on both 10 and 8.1 the only thing in common is the software build of the miners I think it came in around the time many miners began integrating the Ethlargement pill into the miner itself.
459,It’s a command line in claymore miner
460,"You could dual boot a Linux mining OS on it. You can run one off a USB device, and run window 8 when you need it for work."
461,"Okay, in the command line section (in awesome miner), I have a few windows, the first is ""Parameters to Mining Software"", then below there are some options for ""Batch commands""; just not sure what to put where and which numbers I should use (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)"
462,not worth the effort since even then I still wouldn't be profitable.
463,Put “-strap 1” and then allow miner to start with admin settings
464,If you have a spare USB you can be up and running on an OS in less than 10 min.
465,"Sorry to be a pain, [here](https://imgur.com/a/yv5vePj) is the image of the command screen on awesome miner.  Can you tell me where exactly to put that?  Also, quick research online shows there might be a -boost command as well (might only be AMD)?  Thanks"
466,"bro i've already said it doesn't matter, I can't turn a profit right now at my power costs even with this fixed it still wouldn't be profitable."
467,"""parameters etc etc"" is the location.

right clicking the miner, on the bottom click ""properties,"" navigate to ""environment"" and check ""run as adminstrator."" Then run in AM."
468,"Okay I see - it looks like the ""-strap 1"" worked, but then the miner crashed; figure I need to go back to stock settings and re-work my OC?  Also, worth tinkering with strap 2, 3, 4, or just go with 1?  Thanks so much for your help"
469,I reset the OC to stock (other than starting at 70% power) and it still crashed from the get-go.  Anything I could be missing?
470,"Not exactly sure of what you mean, but in my experience you need to log into the web GUI and set up your flight sheet. I’ve done that on a different computer."
471,Miner wont run until you setup a flight sheet.  There are basic guides on youtube on how to set everything up.
472,I will say getting going with nice hash was much faster
473,"Windows is a lot more noob friendly for sure, but i've found hive OS to be much more stable and easier to maintain.  You just have to get over that little hump of a learning curve."
474,Opinions on simple miner?
475," I tried Smos a little over a year ago.  It was a lot easier than hiveOS to use but it wasn't being updated fast enough with the latest mining software so I had to jump ship back to hiveOS.  

The price was another thing that was a turn off because the lack of updates and features wasn't worth, while hive is free for your first 3 rigs.  Im sure that Smos has changed all that by now though, I suggest you try it out if you havent yet."
476,Nice hash was plug and play for gpu miner I built. I had already used it for ASICS and it was only one that was working g correctly I will be trying hive again tonight thanks man.
477,"Hi, i can test your sys"
478,"Great, thanks shoot me a DM"
479,80% use of a 1200 watt supply is 960w. I’d assume you’ll want a higher PSU to handle the 80% electricity rule.
480,"Why not just run the rig with a 65% or 70% power limit? You lose a small amount of hashrate, and use much less power."
481,PSU's are only rated for use at 80% of max. It more than likely just can't handle it. It would be better to have a bigger one so you don't end up blowing it along with all your components.. you don't wants to release the magic smoke.
482,Change power supply. You pulling way too much.
483,Don't over stress it anymore! You could permanently damage the PSU. I suggest that you buy another 350W PSU which is pretty cheap. Or just get a used one.
484,"Like others have said, your more than likely overloading your PSU. Does yours have the single/multi-rail switch? If so you are running in multi, its possible you may just be overloading a single rail.  I have a 1000w corsair in my old gaming/mining rig and it wouldn't even handle two Vega64 without crashing the system. Turned out one of the rails was weak. I doubt ill ever buy a Corsair PSU again."
485,What? Why are you running your GPUs at 100-105%? Are you mad? :)
486,"Supers are rated at 175W but they go up to 190 in stock, Memory OC will also push power consumption up, it's not part of the powerlimit calculation.

You will never run them all at 110 TDP on this PSU"
487,"How are you measuring power, at what point physically on the rig is your power monitoring hardware?

 

Does this occur when you start up the gpus one at a time to make sure the initial power spike at the start of mining isn't happening on all cards at once?

 

Does this still occur if you slowly raise the power level while mining?"
488,Just go for 70-90% power limit on your cards and you'll be fine.
489,"Replace it.  This is usually the first sign of the PS dying.  RMA the PS, and HOPE that those assholes at Corsair honour the warranty.  They aren't named after thieving pirates for nothing."
490,Agreed anythint over that is a fire hazard.  Not worth bro
491,electricity rule? can u explain me what does it mean?
492,"1. i have free electricity
2. on cuckaroo29 im summary lost amount 5-6 g/s with PL 70%. thats more then 10% off all hashrate"
493,"in any mode (single or multi) i have that problem. seems, that switch doesnt work"
494,Really? I've been running 8 GPUs on a 1000W Corsair for a few weeks now without any issues.
495,I RMAd a Corsair PSU and got sent three brand new ones back. I don't think they're thieving pirates at all.
496,I bought that PS 6 months ago. I will only change it as a last resort.
497,"> 80% rule applies to continious loads such as motors, lighting or any load expected to be on 3 hours or more. 

If your system is pulling more than 80% of the total output for 3 hours it’s possible to overheat the PSU. Which could cause premature failure."
498,"but your cards also run COOLER with lower fan speeds, lower power limit isn't just about saving on power costs, its about preserving the life of the GPU's"
499,"Take off one card and see if the problem persists? If so, reducing to 90% or 80% power is probably good."
500,Buy a small one and run two psus. Will take the load off the main one
501,"Then load test it one card at a time. Bit from everything you've said, the power supply is at fault."
502,"This is BS for cheap PSUs that are being overmarked beyond their capabilities. And OCP and OPP on proper PSUs is set in such a way so it never triggers at their rated load because they're actually capable of what was advertised.

on 1200HX this is 1440 Watts total."
503,"without one gpu i can push limits (114 PL on all gpu) and all work fine. kk, im go try it."
504,"You don’t cheap out on power supplies or anything dealing with power. 

If they’re pulling 1kw then getting a PSU that can handle that at 80% is the best decision.  A 1300w is what OP needs."
505,"Depends on electricity.

Mining Eth for Vega 56/64, you can get 44.3 Mh/s pulling 150W (GPU only)

Using Soft Powerplay Tables."
506,"depends completely on your power costs, virtually any card from the last 8 years is ""viable"" provided your power is cheap enough, you NEED to look at power draw vs power cost then do the math and see if the profit is worth the effort to you."
507,"You can save about 200 watts of power usage by putting the cards all on one rig.

Most gaming motherboards should support 4 cards if you use risers and you can connect both PSU to the same mobo as well. Definitely will help profitability to lose the wasted electricity from running the 2nd cpu/mobo."
508,"Yes, I think one of my friends is mining RYO with these cards and hash rate is pretty amazing."
509,"You should try NiceHash. Getting paid in BTC, while you can use the exchange on the NiceHash platform to exchange BTC to ETH, LTC, BCH, XRP, Stellar, Dash,...

disclaimer: I work at NiceHash. :)"
510,"I do Awesome Miner, using mining pool hub, Nicehash, and a grin pool. I convert my Grins to ETH or BTC. I keep most of the alt coins I mine on mining pool hub, auto deposited to my Exodus wallets. Coins I don't have wallets for, I auto convert, usually into ETH (in MPH automatically). NH of course pays out in BTC.

&#x200B;

All into Exodus, which I periodically transfer into alt coins that are down. I've bought a few penny coins that went up a few thousand percent. I try to keep most of my holdings in BTC and a few other big alt coins."
511,"Some pools can do this for you. Most popular options (excl NiceHash) are MiningPoolHub, ZergPool and ZPool"
512,"if you are doing profit switching and NOT converting to BTC then you are failing, the whole concept of profit switching is to convert out of the coin to something more stable. If you are worried about Fees then don't use Betterhash although I don't see any mention of a fee for that on their platform.

as for ""damage"" well that depends if you have it confirgured right, a proper mining setup reduces the Power Limit on Nvidia cards or Voltage on AMD cards resulting in the card running much cooler then if it was being overclocked and used for gaming, now if you are using your gaming OC settings to mine you are likely frying your hardware from the temps they are running at.

Another thing you should be worried about, since you are worried about fees and such is the COST the POWER to mine is costing you, you want to make sure the cost to mine is less then what you are earning otherwise you are losing money."
513,What program are you using?
514,"The difference is convenience versus versatility.  By converting to BCH you save yourself the hassle of trying to find an exchange to sell yourself but at the cost of fees.  But also know if you try and sell yourself you have to often register, go through KYC, and you won’t get what you think as there’s inevitably a fee to sell as well.

To be honest the difference unless you’re running a huge mining farm will most likely be minimal.  Say you’re mining $2-6 a day, the difference is not that much.  Unless you’re hopeful that the altcoin that you mine will 10x, I’m all for converting to whichever you want.  Some altcoins are so small that it’s not on a big enough exchange or you won’t see enough trading volume.  I have coins that I don’t think I’ll ever be able to offload.  For instance there’s coins that I’ve mined and though I could easily sell.  But after finding an exchange I was surprised that I received around 10% than I was expecting.  Right now my coin of choice is BCH over BTC.  

Also run your own calculations.  I’ve calculated that for auto converting with my modest rigs I’m around $6-6.50 a day using Zergpool and auto converting to BCH.  For the next week or so going to try putting my GPU on ethash and my a9 on equihash on NiceHash and my other rigs on Odocrypt mining Digibyte direct to see if there’s a noticeable difference."
515,Bring MTP back
516,"I appreciate your response. I don’t have my pc OC at all and am running everything on standard settings. Your explanation of the BTC conversion was definitely a “come to Jesus moment” for me if you will. I needed it explained like that to realize that I am indeed failing so I turned that setting back on. 

In regards to power I am blessed to be living in Washington State in an apartment complex. I’m not sure how it is elsewhere but electricity is paid communally meaning the electricity company looks at the electricity consumption for the whole building and then charges everyone the same amount. 

I am wondering if I should switch over to NiceHash but figure I should use BetterHash for at least a month before making a switch. That’s a whole different discussion in itself."
517,I’m currently using BetterHash.
518,"To anyone reading this, never ever heed his advice about auto converting to BCH. The pairing availability of BCH is abysmally little and BCH has low liquidity, resulting you actually got way less than what you mined.

Also, holding BCH means getting poorer overtime. BCH went from 1:0.2BTC to 1:0.027BTC rendering you poorer than what you can mine."
519,"> am running everything on standard settings

even that can be a bad thing, HEAT is your biggest concern to longevity of hardware even running at stock settings, stock settings also are NOT optimal, time and time again it's proven you can get higher earnings by reducing the power then tweaking the Mem and Core speeds to what is optimal for the hardware you have, take this post here for example https://old.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/dpiw02/gtx_1660_super_mining_hashrates_stock_settings/ at stock settings the GPU mined Eth at 26.3 MH/s but with tweaking he got up to 30.3 (greater then a 10% increase) while reducing the power draw which means more profits with less heat. You should do research into whats the optimal settings for the kind of GPU you have, CPU mining isn't worth the effort even in your case because there just isn't any earnings worth a damn, but that will change at the end of the month.

>I am wondering if I should switch over to NiceHash

the benefit there is you get paid based on submitted shares (pieces of work that eventually lead to a block being solved) which IMHO is better for someone that isn't committed to 24/7 mining, you are also directly selling your shares for BTC instead of going through a delayed conversion process, profit switching needs that instant conversion and you don't typically see that with the auto-convert pools, generally what will happen with those pools is you will earn X amount of a coin based on the work you did then you have to wait for X number of confirmations before you can actually do something with that coin (this can take several hours) then you send it off to trade for BTC at the market price then you wait for the BTC to confirm in, in all this delay can cause what was most profitable to no longer be better by the time the exchange occurs, Nicehash cuts all that out by paying you directly for your shares so the only question with them comes down to are buyers paying market value for the hashrate or can you make more mining elsewhere."
520,Never did I say that BCH is the highest profitable coin to exchange.  You’re free to choose whichever coin you want to mine or trade into.  If it was all about the most profitable then no one would ever mine/trade into the smaller coins and we’d all mine the same coin.
521,"You may want to ditch it for OverdriveNTool. Much easier to set core and memory clocks, and undervolts like a champ. I had my 580 rig set at 800mV and was completely stable (on Ethereum at least). I seem to recall another program like OverdriveNTool but can also change timing on the fly. Can't remember the name at the moment.

Be sure to download the correct version though, depending on which driver version you have installed."
522,I'll try out that program. Thank you for the response!

526,Looks like flux.
527,Connecting it to a Mac with a USB riser and trying to install drivers in .dmg format?
528,It's more than likely just oil from the pads that are used to keep thermals down.  EVGA cards leak like a 50's biker.
529,It's grease from the melted thermal pads. No worries.
530,Heat. Left over flux from assembly bleeding out.
531,It's excess flux that flowed from heat.
532,"Yeah this is normal, should work fine. My evga 1080 looks like a greasy hobo"
533,i see no damage in this... the oily spots are normal.
534,I think it may be the solder flux separating out from the joints due to heat. All of mine have it and they all work fine.
535,"The substance is from the thermal pads located between the heat sync and the cards boards.

If they run all the time it will bleed. It's non-conductive so it shouldn't cause issues. 

It can cause extra dust to stick to the board though. 

If you want to clean it up and delay it from coming back you can replace the thermal tape on the boards and clean the substance off. 

It's not a bad idea to reapply thermal paste once in a while anyway so you can replace the thermal tape at the same time."
536,Gigabyte thermal pads are notorious for this.  Which gpu vendor are you running?
537,Never seen l'srh like that on my MSI cards! 😱
538,"Hard to tell but I do notice that the damage is all around through hole solder components.  Maybe a reaction between that solder and the board, maybe due to heat, maybe not.  The solder on those components is different than the paste for the surface mount components.  What’s the make and model of the gpu?"
539,It's just left over manufacturing oil/grease/shit being forced out from the heat. It's harmless in most cases. Nearly every GPU gets it
540,Yea that's just some grease resulting from heat. Perfectly normal.
541,">that looks like the same greasy stuff thats on all my evga cards, never caused harm just looks weird

OP said this caused DAMAGE, or maybe dmg.  dmg could be a new codeword by killenials.

542,"It’s from a hp omen prebuilt, but it is a nvidia GeForce gtx 1070"
543,But evga seems to be the worst.
544,"HP makes (probably?) makes no computer parts and just assembles computers made by parts from the lowest bidders.  

Nvidia I believe only makes the founders editions which this is not. 

Should be a brand on their somewhere......  

But I’ve only seen evga cards this bad. 

Of course 4/4 of my evga cards look this way. 

I had one pny have a little bit."
545,Wow.  I can’t believe they would put a 1070 into a laptop.  They generate a LOT of heat.  Does it still work or did the solder goo from the through holes short out the surrounding components?
546,"Isnt evga supposed to be the best gpu manufacturer, blabla?"
547,Hp omen is also a desktop. This gfx card has the steel faceplate for desktops
548,EVGA typically has the best warranty imo. Asus and EVGA both have great cooling.
549,"I really don’t know how they stack up. I’ve not had a problem with any of mine but the asus tends to have the best cooling.  

I just know evga is the worst for this leakage thing."
550,"Yeah asus have great cooling. Theyre more expensive tought, right? I have a asus GTX 1080. its great and good in cooling."
551,Evga is usually up there in pricing but I feel its worth it
552,no idea but generally the hashrates aren't spectacularly different from the consumer level cards
553,what are you mining?
554,"The real question is, what's the ROI... And will you live to see it."
555,based on Cuda Core Count and Architecture design probably somewhere around that of a 2070 (NOT the Super) maybe a bit slower since the base clock and boost clocks are much lower.
556,Ethereum and ckb (Nervos)

Temps have been fine on all the cards but there is a pair of ROG STRIX 570s that seem to be running hot (fan speeds are about 30% higher than the rest). Likely due to OCs/memory brand. Just realized I forgot to mention that brand as well but those are my first purchased cards by a few months."
614,"The trackpad popping up on a laptop is a key sign that the battery expanded. Normally from heat and always charging.

616,"So if it ***will*** boot and mine on HiveOS it obviously works, are you saying booting into windows wont work or something changed and now you can't get it to post at all with 2-3+ GPU's?"
617,"Check how many pcie lanes a 3600 has, and how many lanes your Mobo takes. If you have 2 cards on the motherboard and the rest on risers, that's what I have. My Ryzen 7 1700 would only handle 5 cards max, because of pcie lanes. Have you tried it with less cards? Tried testing the video output of multiple cards? I believe you can actually use a card on a riser for your monitor"
618,"Everything boots and mining functionality works fine with between 1-6x GPUs. I just can't get any type of HDMI video output from the rig itself after I add more than 2-3x GPUs. This keeps me from being able to jump into the BIOS from the POST screen using DEL, and the HiveOS console isn't accessible without using the remote console function.


It hasn't been an issue to this point because I can config via HiveOS web portal without needing a monitor, but I'm planning to switch back to Windows soon and am worried I'll need to get new motherboards to get any usability."
619,Interesting observation! 24 lanes max for AM4
620,You may need to enable 4g encoding or manually select pcie gen 1 or something. Also updating the bios is a good idea too usually
621,"Yep some gaming mobo have a hard time recognizing more than 3 cards.

Install your Risers with power to them, but no gpus, then go update your bios, even if it's on the newest version already.

It should trick it into recognizing the new pcie slots. Then  power off and reinstall the gpus.

Worked on an older ASROCK 270 board I had."
622,"I will go back and double check but I've already gone through the entire BIOS and enabled these settings when I set it up (Gen 1, Above 4G, etc). The problem isn't with recognizing the multiple cards (I'm mining on them all now), it just doesn't output video from any of them or the HDMI on the mobo.

Might try the reflash and see what happens."
623,Did you set it to pci gen 1? That fixed my issue
624,"Yes, I disconnected all but one of the GPUs and booted into the BIOS. Everything in the PCI settings is set to Gen 1, and Above 4G is enabled. Rebooted with all 6 and still no signal.


Next step will be reflashing the BIOS with all the risers attached."
625,Its entirely possible your chipset doesnt have enough pcie lanes I guess.. you can try to disable all the extra stuff like onboard sound to free some up
626,Idk what your question is here
627,Restore everything once.

Don't use power splitters or you're going to have a bad time. 

There's no reason to believe the 8-pin PCIE cable rated for 150W coming from the power supply can support 150W+75W combined."
661,"If there's any doubt, you can usually buy a power supply with 4 or 6 pcie cables for like $50 on eBay and hook up 2 power supplies"

663,"I believe the 8-pin VGA cable can take handle at least 225W, based on that link in this subreddit wiki.. 

https://www.gpuminingresources.com/p/psu-cables.html

Another reason to believe is is they come with 2x6+2 cables, so why would the manufacturer give that extra 8-pin connector if the cable can't handle it?

What doesn't make sense is why they come with 2x6+2 cables if, as that page says, they are only rated for 288W (and not 2x150W).

Any more insights appreciated.."
664,"Re: the 80% rule, ok that would rule out 20AWG, fair enough.  Still, not sure why you're saying to completely avoid splitters, or not trust in the PSU cables."
665,"According to the PCI-E specification, an 8-pin PCI-E power connector is rated at 150W. So a PSU manufacturer doesn't necessarily design for the connectors or cables to handle more than the specification. 

That link specifically states:

>First let's be clear that PCI-SIG lists the maximum rating of its 6-pin PCI-e connector at 75 watts, and its 8-pin PCI-e connector at 150 watts. That is the safe rating, and you go any higher than that at your own risk."
666,">not sure why you're saying to completely avoid splitters, or not trust in the PSU cables.

Experience. I have melted power connectors trying to push them beyond their specification. If any connection or wire feels even barely warm to the touch, it's carrying too much power. Even with a pricey trusted premium brand power supply like Seasonic, that doesn't mean the wire size or connectors are rated for exceeding the PCI-E specification. Honestly that website saying you can push 288W through an 8-pin PCI-E power connector is irresponsible and dangerous.

EDIT: [https://graphicscardhub.com/graphics-card-pcie-power-connectors/](https://graphicscardhub.com/graphics-card-pcie-power-connectors/)

>A graphics card with one 8-pin power connector can get maximum of 225W of power, 75W from PCI Express x16 slot and 150W from the 8-pin connector from the power supply."
667,So why would the PSU manufacturers supply 2x6+2 cables in the first place?  It doesn't make sense..

684,"your dorm room is going to be unbearably hot.

if you want to part it out, go for it, but those cards might not be as easy to sell as you think"
685,I mined in my dorm on free electric on 8x 1080tis and i domt recommend it unless you want your room mates to hate you. also no amount of AC will combat the power hungry gpus
686,"Part it out if you can make a profit, we are a little over 28 days from the RandomX fork and 4GB cards are all but worthless for Eth or will be shortly.

 Screw waiting 6 months to turn a profit, profit now."
687,"I would part 2-4 cards of the rig. You will have less heat, less money on the rig and a smaller chance to get caught by your uni. With 4-6 cards you will still make money as you have free electric. Oh, the most important mine the coin you want directly, not through Nicehash."
688,"The only parts that you can expect to sell are the graphics cards, other smaller parts while you can still sell them, aren’t often in demand enough or the cost to sell isn’t worth it.  Selling a $20-30 cpu, listing it, entertaining offers, then finally selling it only to pay $6-8 to ship it isn’t worth it."
689,"GPU Mining makes no sense, even with free electricity you don't make enough to pay for cost after half a year on second-hand equipment.  

Don't waste your money and time."
690,I think it's a fair deal. I have some 470 I bought pretty cheap then and mining RYO with these cards and i think these cards are the beast.
691,even if I get a plug in AC unit do you still think the heat will be too much?
692,"I second this. $2.50 per day profit shouldn't be worth it to OP for the heat and noise of the rig in your sleeping space. Roommates will hate you for it, 0% chance of getting action in there, risk of theft and spilling and getting caught. No thanks. 

Reselling is equally worthless. How long will it take OP to part out the rig - 15 hours estimate for $60-$100 profit. Less than minimum wage."
693,I'm looking into a similar rig with all 4gb 480's and not sure its worth getting a rig with 4gb cards. Dont know how useless they will be and if i'll make my ROI in time.
694,i had 6 rx580's and they heated the air conditioned room they were in enough to the point that i didn't want to be in there
695,"One watt is equal to approximately 3.41214 Btu/h

If your rig uses about 1kWh, you'll need an A/C rated for >3400 btu to keep room temp the same.

(at least in theory)"
696,It's more about getting the heat out of the room
697,even if te A/C was enough you have now added the cost of the A/C to the dollar numbers you would need to earn back thereby nearly doubling your break even time line.
698,Venting cool air in is not as effective as venting the hot air out
699,take appart the rig would barely take an hour or two max
700,4GB cards are already worthless IMHO.
701,"yeah, but the whole point is free electricity in a dorm room"
702,"part out =/= take apart

What I mean is disassemble, take photos, post to classified (ebay/craigslist for instance), communication with potential buyers (questions/negotiating), then shipping or meeting buyers.

With an 8 card rig I think 15 hours is a decent estimate of the above steps. The majority of time going to communication and meeting buyers (transportation)."

p.s I live in a dorm. So basiclly I have no electricity bills.  
Also. What is the best option for this type configuration?"
716,"how do you set fan speed in nvidia inspector via batch file?  i've been using ""-setFanSpeed:0,50"" but it doesn't do anything.  the fans stay automatic and unchanged.  when i expand the overclocking menu in the nvidia inspector app the fan portion is greyed out and checked to auto but this can't be altered."
717,"I have input for the PSU question.  
I have used 5 or 6 gold/plat PSU's in the past couple years and one PSU stood out beyond the rest for mining applications.  
The Enermax Platimax 850w Platinum , which i paid 200Cad for a couple years ago, is the best.

It comes with more ports for 2+6pins, and while stock it comes with cables for 6x 8pin, you can buy another cable for 20$ online and get a 4th set on it. I can't stress how amazing that is, because without it, 3x1070ti's pull 125w each and doesnt even get close to 80%ing the 850w range, even with the mobo on it. It was the only 850 capable of 4x8pin.   
The next better thing about the Enermax over comparable plats like my thermaltake 850 plat or the seagate 850 plat, is the power is split into 4 rails, instead of the 1 or two used by the others. This means a more stable power wave when used by multiple cards. Mucho greatness. The others are good, but not as good as this one.   
Not sure how much it's worth now, or even if there is a gold version for 100$ somewhere, but this Enermax was superior than the others."
718,"determine what gives the best returns and do that, you want to maximize your income so that you can hopefully turn a profit over power costs, if you are earning below power costs then you are better off just buying unless you need the extra heat."
719,I would stick with exactly what you're doing.
720,average daily return?
721,"pretty much any 80+ Bronze or better PSU will work for a single GPU, you will however need basically FREE POWER if you expect to make any money at all with that, you are looking at like 30 cents a day before power costs are factored in."
722,"YES, the hashrates of X16r, X16rV2 and X16s all vary wildly.

The best way to measure changes from OCing these algos is to add to the bat file ""-N 1000"" minus the quotation marks, this will give you the average hashrate of the last 1,000 shares, you can adjust this number up or down but it's generally considered a good idea to go higher to get a more accurate average, but longer intervals will make it take longer to see the effects of OCing changes."
723,I just mine as a hobbyist but nicehash OS is pretty simple and straight forward. I do believe there is a minimum withdrawal from the nicehash wallet of possibly 10$? I haven't had any issues with them since I started
724,100% not at this time
725,"Unfortunately nothing will pay for itself in that timeframe. What you could do is get a GPU you like, and mine with it for those 3 months to basically act as a discounted price. For example if you bought a 1660TI card and mine for 3 months you'll make about $30. Or a 2080 could bring you about $60."
726,"Cards will take many years to pay for themselves now, your best bet is to buy them and mine on them until the last day of the return policy and return it for a full refund. Rinse and repeat between a few stores and always get 2080 TIs."
727,"Thanks for the tip. Tbh it is earning less than energy costs, however the bonus is I work from home and with winter approaching it actually keeps my office a few degrees warmer which means I don’t put the heating on during the day. Also it is an exercise in MIY (mine it yourself), so guess I am paying for the privilege a bit there."
728,"cheers, will do then."
729,Not profitable but both about the same when I did a comparison over 20 odd days non-stop. 25-30cents a day maybe if the markets are good
730,ah thats very cool.  ill give that a shot
731,"Was there any problems with NH after the major hacking event back in the days? I kinda fell off, to be honest, but there were some other algo switching miners popping up. They were a lot more complicated tho."
732,Why not?
733,Okay thanks!
734,Not since the hack but as of today they have about 80% of the funds returned to people they are waiting for most of the last 20% to come forward and make the claims to there coins there we're stolen

740,Not those.. ubit.  These VER labels are pretty meaningless as far as I can tell.  There's no standard.. just whatever label is trending at the time.
741,how do these compare to 1660 and 1660ti? Curious to see how close the Super is to the Ti.
742,Really a pointless card to buy new... those hashrates are ancient as hell.
743,/u/uareatowel
744,Did you test progpow? On mobile and can't see the pic well so I don't know if it's included there.
745,"to each their own of course but nicehash is probably the single worst product for GPU mineable coins.  the way a 51% attack can be rented off of nicehash poses major security risks for so many PoW coins.  Personally, I mine VTC and use [https://p2proxy.vertcoin.org](https://p2proxy.vertcoin.org) \- it is ideal for smaller GPU miners."
746,It's very close to the Ti hashrates.
747,my 1660tis get about 30.9 on eth
748,30mhs lol
749,"well bro it's not a freaking Titan it's a $230 card brand new so it's not a matter of how good they are it's how good they are for the money.

That said they don't sound good because you can get RX580's brand new for cheaper that hit those same Eth speeds (not that that should be a deciding factor since there is at most 5 months left before the Eth ProgPOW fork).

Now the Grin number sounds like it's around a 1070 or so, which isn't bad."
750,"my ti is getting \~30,8 MH/s at 70W with OC trick"
751,"Show me another card that gets 30mh on 70 watts ;) I can get 30mh on my 1660 ti's @ 70 watts.

My 1070s can get down to about 100 watts before they tank under 30mh."
752,For $299.99 one can get an rx5700 at Microcenter brand new. If you are mining also can just get a p104 and unlock it to 8Gb but are stuck with reselling unusable hardware on the life cycle end.
753,the RX570 eth hash (OC) was close to this. go look what those go for...
754,But did you actually measure that at the wall?
755,"but how does the 5700 compare in hashrates on coins like Grin and Beam, you can't just look at the Eth hashrate and call it a day is my point, especially since that hashrate will be meaningless inside of 5 months if they actually stick to their promise of a Q1 fork to ProgPOW."
756,Probably not lol sorry buddy rx5700s are beating that Ethash performance. 52mhs at 108 watts. A 1 card system total is 146 full load - 38 idle watts as measured by me at the wall. Hence why in just rx5700s im at 1GH at just under 2400 watts. Other algos are questionable but currently on Ethash the rx5700 holds it down.
757,"Thats a valid point, though how much performance gain is a card like the 1660 super producing? Doesnt seem enough to justify it being used for mining more than any other card at this time though."
758,"No that was off GPUz eyeballing it. Kill-a-watt report is as follows:

1070         31mh 105w          3.39w/mh

1660 Ti     29.7mh  70w         2.36w/mh        

1080 Ti     52mh 210w           4.12w/mh 

Your rx5700  52mh   108w    2.07w/mh

5700 is a little more efficient, much cheaper and less diverse.

&#x200B;

Mix of 5x 10 series cards and a 1660Ti I get about 225mh for 900w.

&#x200B;

Not bad, I didn't know the 5700's were that efficient. AMD scares me with for future mining tho."
759,"Oh no don't get me wrong, I wouldn't advise anyone to buy any of these things, I'm just saying from a purely analytical viewpoint comparing the performance per dollar for each of the new cards how do they stack up, I would never try to suggest anyone should build a GPU mining rig, especially with NEW hardware today, hell even half priced used hardware from the current gen would be questionable and then only if you have stupid cheap power."
760,Right. Commercial and industrial rates in certain states are worth it. But im afraid you are correct for the most part. What hardware are you using?
761,"I started with a Pair of 1080ti's, then during the mining boom of January 2018 (when I was relatively new to mining and not aware of how quickly the market can shift) I bought a pair of the Star Wars Galactic Empire Titan Xp's because they where at the time cheaper then new 1080ti's (because the 1080ti's where being priced at like $1,400 dollars), come the end of 2018 I sold off the 1080ti's because I was turning a bigger profit that way because I had way less money into them so i'm down to my pair of Titan Xp's spread between my 2 machines. At the moment due to power costs i'm shutdown but Winter power rates start in December (as well as the RandomX fork) so I'll be able to fire back up then provided RandomX pays enough and doesn't hurt the GPU's to bad, if it does hurt GPU profits too much i'll just stick with the CPU mining."
762,Nice cards! Though you worry about electric cost with 4 cards? I am curious to see how Randomx turns out.
763,"I worry about electric costs because it's something you need to think about, if you are a HODLER like me your goal is to acquire as much crypto for the dollar spent, it's not that I can't afford the electric cost it's that I can BUY MORE crypto then I can mine for that electric cost, if electric costs exceed earnings then you get more by shutting down and just buying, there is zero reason to mine if your power costs exceed earnings anyway you look at it, if you are a short term miner and immediately sell then you are just straight losing money, if you are a long term miner and you are going for future value even if you end up selling at a loss because coin prices never recover you still lose less in that scenario because you have more coin to sell, to give an example, say I mine 80 cents worth of a coin but it costs me a Dollar to do it then that coin value NEVER increases and actually drops in half that coin i'm holding is now worth 40 cents, if I bought a dollars worth I would be getting 50 cents, now say it goes the other way and doubles in price and I sell, well the 80 cents becomes a $1.60 so I'm 60 cents profit over my power costs where if I bought it i'm a DOLLAR over my power costs.

The ONLY possible justification for mining at a loss is using mining to subsidize your ELECTRIC HEATING, because if you are running electric heat you are burning electricity and might as well burn it via mining."
764,"There were lots of days mining eth where I was getting well over $10 with just 150mh. And there were much higher days.

I don't really know about the future. But I like the idea of consumer hardware that is readily available and affordable being able to either help run the network or verify transactions or do both. A key to crytocurrency in my opinion is that running a node, mining, and acquiring it is available to all. Until we know for sure something better than GPU mining is effective, prevalent, and tested, I like the idea of GPU mining.

Unfortunately, I also like to play videogames and the RX 480 and 580 are basically the same price as they were 4 years ago. At worse they were 2-3x MSRP. And this affects almost all GPUs."
765,"During the peak in 2017/18 I was able to mine/flip shitcoins into btc at $200-$300 a day.  At that rate power costs didn't matter.  Now I'm happy if I get $5-6 a day after power costs.  The nice thing was that I dumped almost everything at 10k BTC and paid off all of my rigs before this shitstorm, so I can hoard for the next run without being out much."
766,"the good days where in excess of $10 a day per 1080ti back in January 2018, it's actually what tricked the then relative mining newb ME into expanding to more cards, in the week it took for my next 2 cards to show up dollar earnings had cut in HALF.

Do I think those days will ever return, NO I most definitely do not, the market is very different then it was 2 years ago, many major algorithms have fallen to ASIC Miners, Some Coins are switching to algo's where modern CPU's give much higher returns for the wattage used and there has been significant development in non-POW based consensus algorithms that could very likely make mining a thing of the past entirely. I think there is the possibility of 1 last surge in GPU Mining coming from the Q1 Ethereum fork to ProgPOW but how good that will be depends on what percentage of the current hashrate is ASIC's, if it's a small percentage there will be a small increase for a while until more miners switch GPU's back over and drive it back down, if it's a significant percentage it could possibly spur a small boom for GPU Mining, but the real shocker is gonna be the day Ethereum makes the move to POS, once that happens GPU Mining is dead, if even HALF the Ethereum hashrate is GPU's and those GPU's need to move somewhere else we are talking about the equivalent hashing power of like 800,000 Radeon VII's having to find a new home, thats a LOT of hashing power to have to move around and after that you are gonna need power costs below like 3-4 cents per KwH to turn a profit until a significant portion of GPU's are shut off and sold off. I just cannot foresee a situation where GPU Mining makes a resurgence."
767,Well I only started mining last November to offset the 2070 I bought but a good Week was about 0.025 to 0.03 Ether. Been declining a bit lately
768,"On average or best ever?  The best ever for me was probably Signatum mining in July/August 2017 on 1070s and 1080 TIs. Then the 1070s were doing $7 per card per day, and the 1080 TIs nearly $12 per card per day. This was after electricity. Second best timing was Vertcoin mining in November/December 2017 when Nicehash was hacked. I was doing nearly $200 per day up for about 2 weeks from $80 or so per day. The vast majority of the time I was making $55 per day profit on about 30 GPUs, mixed 1050 TI, 1070, 1080, and 1080 TIs on Zcash @flypool. Liquidated my operation in September 2018 (having started in May 2017) and resold all the GPUs for 60-70% retail and lived off of mining/holdings for nearly 2.5 years."
769,When eth was above 1k I used to be able to pay a 2k mortgage and power off of 32 x 580 mining.
770,$10/day for my 12x RX 570/470....
771,When I started a 6 x 1070 rig was making £500 a month
772,Have 96 1080s running and I used to make $300 a day on average down to $100 a day at the lowest and $800 a day at the highest. Currently at $40 a day. A good day of mining to me used to be anything $100 or more per day
773,I make about 10usd per day in ETH currently. 30 mixed 570/580s on 4 rigs. I kept scaling for a bit when cards were cheap but now I just run what I have left around.
774,3-5$ a day per card. Sometimes as high as 10.
775,"Back in late 2017/early 2018, I was mining garlicoin when no one knew about it and it was at $3.

There were a few weeks where I was making $300-400 a day. It was the only reason I even came close to not regretting all the hardware I bought. (I had a 30 card farm)

I sold everything a while later when things started to cool off."
776,Mining Bitcoin with two HD 5830s and a GTX 260.  Made over 1 BTC per week.  So long ago.
777,"Eth hitting 350$ is fair for gpu mining again, above that price we are in a cloud nine again 😊"
778,"I am still making more than the electricty costs .. without me doing anything. I think even getting some bucks per month for doing literally ""nothing"" is worth it (as long as your hardware already paid off)

also winter is coming and the free heating is a nice bonus :-)"
779,"I'm mining RYO with my Nvidia cards, the way it's moving up I think this bear season is the best place to take advantage of low difficulty."
780,"The real good mining days were 2015. 3-4 ETH per 290 every day. Now, ETH was only $1 then but the rest is history."
781,hi! what gpus are you using an what are you mining? just curious noobie here too. regards!
782,yea the $10 days were sweet. Miss those days. But they aren't far away again.
783,$200-$300 a day is insane. What was/is your setup?
784,I would echo this but add that mining will never *really* die. It will (and already has been) centralized to large corporate farms. Even with a great power rate that competes with the big guys it is hard for an average sized farm to keep up with the insane amounts of debt that these publicly traded mining operations are taking on to expand.
785,96 1080s is wild. $40 a day after power bill or no?
786,Didn't ETH come out in 2016?
787,"Man, I remember when the RX 480's launched and were tearing it up on Eth. They were like 7 bucks a day each. I still had my 290x's churning and burning, but in hindsight I wish I would have invested in some rx 480's back then. I could have mined on them for a year and a half and then sold them for 2x what I paid!"
788,"I have a variety, which I do not recommend, that I acquired through gamer friends when they upgraded. Two 1080TIs, two 1070s, one 1080, and one 1660TI. I mine ZCoin (MTP) at the moment but also mined Ethereum for a little bit."
789,Price pretty much needs to 3-4x.
790,"I can confirm that, I was also getting pretty similar numbers with the same GPUs. Was Jan 2018 if I remember right."
791,"30 cards 1060s, 1070s and 1080s of various makes.  I picked most of them up discounted as Amazon warehouse deals.  That was the absolute peak of the altcoin cycle though.  That lasted maybe a week.

Edit:. This was also diving deep into shitcoin territory.  I bet most of what I mined at that time has gone down 99% or totally failed since then."
792,"> I would echo this but add that mining will never really die.

Mining as a whole, maybe not but GPU mining is on it's way out and as a whole there is still the threat of different consensus algorithms that eliminate the need to ""mine"" making crypto far more environmentally friendly, which IMHO is the last step to mass adoption, so many hippies in the world today that having things that are as big an environmental catastrophe that is mining and used mining equipment cluttering up landfills is just driving those folks away."
793,"Must be after power because i have 35 cards and gross $20 a day at most right now, most of them being rtx 2070."
794,July 2015
795,It does. Alot of the luls in crypto prices has to do with flushing out inefficient miners. I doubt Eth will inherently see a value increase alone. I think it will ride Bitcoins back for a time. Another issue is I dont see Eth getting more scarce unless a change/update draws floods of developers in buying lots of Ethereum in order to build their projects(2017). It is an ever changing circulating amount so scarcity isnt neccassarily a direct influence on value. But it could become more valuable as countries start accepting blockchain research/development. I know alot of Bitcoin/crypto noobs turn to Ethereum because it’s easier to get into. As the industry grows I believe many will continue to believe and purchas Ethereum just because it does reach to more users with less investment capital.
796,That month was AWESOME!  I had 15 1080tis...God i wish that would have continued.  Getting free heat for my house and blowing breakers if I overclocked too much...the good old days
797,"With the amount of ETH being locked in DeFi recently I'd argue that inflation is already lower than BTC. The whole scarcity argument is kinda dumb though. If we want to encourage transacting on the network, the ""HODL"" culture needs to die. Beside, network security needs to be paid for somehow and block emissions are more friendly to users than high TX fees."
798,"> blowing breakers 

Nothing like being halfway into your shift at work and checking your pool stats online only to see that your hashrate flatlined 30 minutes after you left the house. *Boss, I need to run home real quick for lunch*."
799,I definitely think we need to encourage transactions on the network. Eth to Eth payments.
800,They have been around for a while now. They were not listed for a while though and I suspect that is because Innosilicon did not want to accelerate ProgPOW development. They probably have thousands of them in their own facilities mining and want to dump some in anticipation of the algo change. Bitmain does the same thing.
801,"So much riskier than GPUs though. Lots of proposals to nerf ASICs, no resale value when out of date, can they even be overclocked? Modded?"
802,"[https://innosilicon.com/html/a10-miner/index.html](https://innosilicon.com/html/a10-miner/index.html)

It says shipping in 7 days -\_-"
803,"bro this is GPU mining, not shill ASIC Mining."
804,they are dumping them now because the next batch has already replaced them at 4 times the hashrate https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-asic-dominates-gpu-performance/
805,Sounds exactly how I imagined it.
806,"No idea, wondering what the GPU community has to say."
807,Understood. So thats why I mentioned it... Wondering who is concerned about it... Aka Duh
808,Definitely that also haha
809,I think it's safe to assume that most of the hashrate growth since the Q4 2018 crash is ASICS. So roughly 50 TH/s or 25% of the network.
810,"OK then maybe some better commenting in your post instead of just a link, it makes it look like you are trying to sell these things the way you have it now."
811,Scary to think about. Glad The dev team is up to forking to progpow.
812,Lol I brought up the efficiency and compared it to the latest and best rates from the Rx5700? Shared the link for proof they were shipping within 7 days of cleared payment.
813,Hopefully. Though there is a good chance they just keep delaying it till ETH 2.0 is fully deployed and it is no longer required.
814,"little tip, don't make your subjects super long, people stop reading them, post a clear statement like:

""So is anyone concerned about these ASIC's, the way I see it they do 500 Mh/s at 750 watts for an efficiency of 0.66 Mh/W where RX5700's do 52 Mh/s at 108 watts for an efficiency of 0.48 Mh/W and these things cost $2,500 which is the cheapest hash per dollar making these overall a better choice if you are planning to mine Eth or other ETHash based coins. What impact do you think these will have on Mining?"""
815,Good point. Very possible. I believe there will be some conflict when fork time comes around. I do hope it goes smoothly and we render the asics obsolete. Much like Monero did to Bitmains X3.
816,"Thanks for basically telling me how to talk lol I will post how I please, thank you for your concern though."
817,all i'm saying is post so people can understand what the fuck you are saying going blah blah blah incoherently in the SUBJECT LINE does not mean other people can understand what the fuck you are trying to say.
818,Word I understand man. Sorry your buttons got poked. 😘
819,"You can check out this video for starters: 
https://youtu.be/DaZjnKDDjJ8

If you want the experience of building a rig, that's good. If you want to build your own becuse you think it's cheaper, id recommend you just buy a Veddha frame kit off amazon. A 6 gpu frame costs about $34.  I have 2, they are great."
820,"Check it on Youtube, this is the not the right place for this question."
821,"Join the group, look in the RigPorn section, tons of DYI rigs in there.

https://discord.gg/BbNuW3"
822,"> just buy a Veddha frame kit off amazon

agreed.  I built my own frame out of aluminum and it cost as much if not more than a premade one.  not even taking personal labor and sweat into consideration."
823,Yeah just get a Veddha
824,"Depends where you live, for me a Veddah would be USD 66 including shipping..... I went to the industry area where i could get cheap aluminium from local vendors, payed 4 USD  per 6m angle bar, so two of those, a packet of self drilling screws for 12 USD (which would last for 2 rigs) a piece of 2.4m long 2.1 x 1.2cm planed wood for 5 dollar and i was set to go."
825,Exactly i can get aluminum for cents of a dollar. the veddha i have to pay in pounds with taxes and import fees (50%) from UK so thats a nono.
826,Just be careful of possible condensation
827,"As someone who was mining in Miami, I am insanely jealous. You have an infinite and *free* supply of clean, dry, cold air. I swear I spent more time and money on cooling than on the rig itself.

Anyway. I wouldn't risk putting your rig outside, but to be honest I can't say I really understand your problem. At those temps you're probably paying to heat your house either way, no? And it's only 4 gpus, so it's not like we're talking megawatts here. Put it in whichever room tends to be the coldest and call it a day. Think of it as a bulky space heater that makes you money."
828,"Thermal paste was designed for room temperature and above, at freezing I would expect it to lose surface contact making the possibility of a raw gpu doing a melt down even at 0c.  It's not about the running conditions, it's about the startup and shutdowns."
829,"Put it in a box so that airflow is constant. That should cover condensation too but you’ll have to research that. 

Some people use a hydroponic tent and push/pull outside air while keeping the rigs inside."
830,"The temperature sensors throw a fit if it’s too cold on startup. It isn’t a huge deal if they’re already warmed up, but a below zero cold boot will just throw errors."
831,I would be happy for the heat inside at those temps
832,Bring that puppy inside and use it for heat
833,Nothing dangerous but keep on check temp on daily basis.
834,"Be careful, condensation will kill your gear."
835,Rust will form very fast on the gpu boards. The VRMs that dont have a heatsink on top will form a coating of rust on top.
836,"From what I understand from condensation (Caveman lvl physics) isn't it only possible on surfaces with lower temperature than the air outside? Like when you are mining for example it is not possible to be happening on the GPU's because they are warm all the time. But like when it comes to mobo, I think it will dip lower temperatures than the air outside on some parts."
837,"You probably already seen it, but twotonhasher on YouTube boxed his in Florida. I actually boxed mine inside the house during the summer (highs only reach 90f or so where I am). House was cool but the AC never turned off and EVERYTHING got moisture if not opened.....it was bizarre and probably cause some unwanted mold."
838,"How cold does this generally happen? I have run mine into the teens or lower but don't think I have booted them that cold.

F, not C"
839,Yeah but like how can I be certain about the temps on all components?
840,"Yes but your entire rig isnt likely to be hot, there may be cool spots where water can build up

Edit: didnt read second part of your comment"
841,"Temperature fluctuations and uneven temperature distribution would be the biggest things for me. Air temp can change pretty quickly and uneven head distribution and frost melting near the internals of your case is what would be my primary concern. (Eg. Top of case gets cold enough to form frost on the outside also means it can form frost on the inside). 

Personally I would build a wood enclosure and pipe in the cold air, a custom enclosed case also gives you the opportunity to build in some sound deadening and airflow paths, just make sure to insulate the incoming air pipe and the like (you also got me thinking about how to build one for my servers just to keep the noise down). If you insist on running them outside however I wouldn't run them open air and custom build a case to force airflow through the GPU's first then through everything and make sure the air inside remains above freezing at all times. Probably double insulated because I'm a little paranoid if the air temp jumps up past freezing before any passively heated parts do. Some additional research might also be helpful on how electronics are built to withstand temperature variations as there might also be thermal expansion issues between the PCB's and solder joints if the gap is too wide. Looking at how phase change and ln2 overclockers mitigate condensation might also be useful, pretty sure I've seen some other people consider it or put their rigs in an uninsulated garage for similar effect over the years so there might be a video or two as well.

Additionally I don't live in a climate that gets below freezing so I'm going with best guesses and half remembered discussions. 

This is pretty much just a completely crazy idea but it is possible to build a completely sealed system for use outdoors and use a heat exchanger setup to cool off the internal air. My initial thought was using two radiators filled with antifreeze (car or PC) to pass the cooling through without much worry about condensation buildup given a good seal. A good airflow path and properly sized radiator and internal air would sit close if not at the same as outside. It might even be possible to skip the liquid heat transfer entirely and use an old car intercooler to just cool the air directly. Probably would require a larger set of fans for proper airflow but about the same sort of effort given the work sealing in the rig."
842,Not even close to worth it

844,8th gen CPU is too new for the Asrock H110. You need 6th or 7th gen.
845,"Drop the 1050Ti, these cards are **total garbage** for mining.

**1070Ti** are definitely the best cards in terms of price per hash per watt. They've been the miner's choice for a long time as they're very efficient and versatile (except ETH). You can't go wrong with it.

**1660Ti** are decent cards, but they will be less efficient than 1070Ti on most algos. 1070Ti has 2432 CUDA cores whereas 1660 Ti only has 1536, and even if the 1660 has GDDR6 memory instead of the 1070Ti's GDDR5, it will still lag behind the 1070Ti, both in terms of hashrate and power efficiency.

To sum it up, if I were you I'd go for a full 1070Ti rig.

Broadly speaking, keep in mind that it's much easier to use only one model of GPUs for your rig.

And don't build rigs with low-end cards like 1050Ti just because they're cheap and you can buy a lot of them. It's a beginner mistake. It's better (and more profitable) to buy higher-end cards like the 1070Ti or 1080Ti, even if you start with only 2 or 3 cards. You will mine more crypto with less power, the cards will stay profitable longer, and their resale value will hold better in time, too."
846,I think this is reasonable
847,"2 year old now outdated GPU's based on a 3 year old architecture, a crappy CPU, I mean if you where building this in November 2017 when the 1070ti released hell yeah, but not in November 2019 it's not.

for simplicity it's best to use the same GPU across the whole rig, it makes tuning easier, you want the current gen stuff, you don't want some BTC mining board, you want something that supports Ryzen so you can make money on the Monero RandomX fork."
848,Ok but the GPU's are OK or I need to change?
849,"In this moment in Amazon the GeForce ASUS ROG-STRIX-RTX2060-O6G-GAMING, 6GB GDDR6 is down the price for $20 dolars more than the 1070Ti, do you think that is viable buy two and two of each model? or start with one and one?"
850,"Hey my 1050 Tis were pretty legit... in 2017. When I liquidated my rigs those were actually the first to sell. They were also one of the few cards that could run on SATA risers because of how little power they drew. But yes, overall low end cards are just wasting money on the other components. I had a 4x 1050 Ti rig but it was a Frankenstein built from old pc parts I found in my parents basement - otherwise I wouldn’t recommend it."
851,Ok and if I change the GPU's for a two rtx 2060 is viable to do that?? Or is better a antminer s9?
852,You need to google ProgPOW and RandomX.  You want something with GDDR6 to fair better in the future.  Stick with 1660ti or 1660 super (based on your current choices).
853,"It's really simplier to use only one card model accross your rig.

If the 2060 is the same price than a 1070 Ti, it's a tough choice. The 2060 has GDDR6 and the resell value will probably be higher in a year or two, compared to a 1070 Ti, BUT it has only 6 GB of RAM compared to the 1070 Ti (which has 8 GB) and 1920 cores vs 2432 for the 1070 Ti.

The very best would be if you can go for a RTX 2060 **Super**. It has 2176 cores and 8 GB of RAM, so it's equivalent to a 1070 Ti (still has less cores though), and to a RTX 2070.

[https://whattomine.com/](https://whattomine.com/) will give you a good idea of the cards hashrate depending on the algo. What algo/coin are you planning to mine ?

Anyway, yes, maybe you can go for one model of each card first so you can test it. It might be a good idea, especially with Amazon given that you'll have one month to send them back and get a full refund if needed."
854,"Hahaha, no offense here, I did mine with a couple 1050 Ti in 2017 too ;)

It's just that in terms of efficiency (hash per watt, and price per hash per watt) the 1050 Ti can't keep up with a 1070 Ti or even a 1060. A 1070 Ti will be 50% or even 100% more efficient than a 1050 Ti on almost any algo."
855,"an S9 would bring in about $2 a day after your power costs at current bitcoin price and difficulty, if you can get one for cheap maybe but it depends on the price point."
856,"If the 1070Ti are way cheaper than the RTX 2060, you should go for the 1070Ti. These two cards have about the same performance at mining on most algos.

The only advantage of the RTX 2060 compared to the 1070Ti would be their resell value in one or two years, if you're planning to eventually sell them for newer cards at some point."
857,Just get a super strong cpu and mine monero
858,"Disagree here. GDDR6 doesn't make up to the difference of CUDA cores between 1070Ti and 1660 Super. 1070Ti has 2432 cores, 1660 Super only has 1408. That's 70% more. It makes a huge difference in terms of hashrate.

1070Ti is a far better choice for mining, despite being an older card."
859,"Oh no doubt. I mostly had 1080 Tis and 1070s, the 1070 Ti wasn’t even out when I was building rigs still so the game has definitely changed since then."
860,"In this moment in Amazon the GeForce ASUS ROG-STRIX-RTX2060-O6G-GAMING, 6GB GDDR6 is down the price for $20 dolars more than the 1070Ti, do you think that is viable buy two and two of each model? or start with one and one?"
861,What cpu and mother You recommend me?
862,"With RandomX and ProgPOW, the 1070ti is GDDR5, which gets owned by hbm and GDDR6. You can see a Vega 56 with HBM owning a 1080ti with GDDR5. [https://randomx.monerobenchmarks.info/index.php](https://randomx.monerobenchmarks.info/index.php)

&#x200B;

On ProgPOW you will see the same thing, including those with GDDR6. [https://progpow.pro/](https://progpow.pro/)

&#x200B;

The CUDA cores is a good argument. I want to see a direct comparison, which neither website offers."
863,"Better to start with one model only. It will be simplier to tune, overclcock and troubleshoot your rig.

As for the RTX 2060 vs the 1070 Ti, see my comment above."
864,TR4 1950x and cheapest mobo might be a decent bet
865,"He's talking about CPU mining here, you need to understand that it's less versatile than doing GPU mining.

If you go for a Ryzen CPU you will basically have no choice other than to mine Monero, whereas with a Nvidia GPU you can mine virtually any PoW coin you want.

GPU mining is still king."
866,"Yeah you might be right about ProgPoW and RandomX. But these are only two algos, specific to ETH and Monero.

On almost any other algo like x16r, Equihash, Neoscrypt, Beam, Cuckoo, etc., the 1070Ti is doing as good as the 2060/2070 with GDDR6.

You can have a look at whattomine for hashrate comparison: [https://whattomine.com/](https://whattomine.com/).

If you look at the algo Equihash 192\_7 for instance, you see that a RTX 2070 is still less efficient than a 1070Ti! [https://miniz.ch/1927-2/](https://miniz.ch/1927-2/)

This is why, given you can get them cheap, 1070 Ti still are good choice for mining."
867,"only if you get it super cheap, like cheaper then a 3700X, otherwise you would be better off with the 3700X because you can get basically the same hashrates (looking at benchmarks) at lower power draws thanks to the doubling of the L3 cache on ryzen 3000 and the higher energy efficiency of the 7nm node. Looking at Ebay 1950x's seam to be selling at about the $300 + Shipping and a brand new 3700X is $330, then factor in the costs of Mobo's and you are basically coming out even except you are getting brand new parts instead of used parts and the parts are newer and faster."
868,">GPU mining is still king.

No, its not. 

Its dead right now and the nail in the coffin is coming with RandomX algo change for Monero. There are going to a LOT of AMD cards on the market soon. 

Unless you want to mine endless shitcoins, dont buy GPUs right now. 

The ONLY feasible thing for any miner to do right now is build Ryzen Rigs to get in on the RandomX as early as possible and pray to make a good profit."
869,"Crypto mining as a whole right now is barely profitable for small time miners, I can agree on that.

But going for a Ryzen to CPU mine, you'll get stuck mining Monero and have barely any other choice. With a GPU, you have plenty of coins to chose from, including Top 100 coins like ETC, Doge, BTG, RVN, KMD, etc.

Besides, the gaming market keeps GPU prices at decent levels on the second-hand market, which makes it easier to resell and repay for the cards if needed."
870,It came out 60mins ago... You'll probably have to wait a few days for hashrates.
871,I'd assume RVN hashrate will be exactly the same consider the core is the same. Interestingly enough the Ethereum hashrate will be much better and exactly like the more expensive 1660ti. Basically anything that uses Memory Bandwidth will be close to 1660ti levels.
872,"Hashrate depends on Algorithm, these cards are ideal for CN-GPU(Ryocurrency), did you try that algo?"
873,SoonTM
874,"Hashrate for what algo?

Worth noting that the 1660 Super only has 1408 CUDA cores, vs 1536 for the 1660 Ti. Not sure that the hashrate will be so good compared to the Ti, even with GDDR6.

At current prices the 1070Ti with its 2432 cores and GDDR5 is still a way better mining card than the 1660 series in terms of price per hash per watt."
875,Just curious if someone saw if one of the reviewers include hashrates.. thanks
876,"hmm... TI uses 12 ghz mem while Super is upped to 14, so what we're all hoping for is a 10% increase in hashrate over the TI."
877,Which coins need memory b/w vs CUDA cores?
878,Does this use Turing's specialized cores (INT32/Tensor/RT)?
879,"the tech reviewers don't do mining hashrate tests, mining hashrate tests are the domain of the mining youtubers and those guys aren't seeded review samples like the tech tubers."
880,Yes but less cores in the Super (1408) than in the Ti (1536).
881,Check if bios is up to date.And enable 4G decoding in bios.
882,"Firstly, check if all GPUs and risers work properly. Connect only 1 GPU and 1 riser at the time. Repeat this until you notice a GPU or a riser that fails. My guess is that one of the risers is bad. Sometimes the yellow cable(far left) on the SATA gets burned. Visually check these cables.
Also, make sure that you do not connect more than 2 risers per 1 SATA cable. 

If you did not find an issue here, then most likely there is a software issue. 

If you have enabled 4g decoding, then try experimenting with gen speed. Set it to gen1, gen2 or gen3.

In Windows, delete drivers with DDU(Display Driver Uninstaller), restart the rig and then install the latest drivers. If this did not help, uninstall drivers, shut down rig and connect only 1 GPU, install drivers again, shut down rig add another GPU, install drivers again and repeat until all GPUs are recognized."
883,"I have 4g enabled, I know that for sure. I'll have to check bios version tonight"

905,yeap.. just remember never ever use SATA ever to power your GPU....
906,"At least you used the better crimped connector and not the cheapo overmolded type. But yeah, they're only rated for around 30w I think. Then again I've had 6 pin pcie connectors do the same thing, sometimes you just get a bad crimp from the factory and she lets the smoke out."

911,Yikes. I've been running my risers with SATA for the last year. I was under the assumption a direct SATA connection was better than the adapter cables. My PSU's didnt come with enough 6 pin cables to do both GPU's and risers. My only other option would be molex on the risers

920,Enable T-Rex miner set Power Limit to 70% core +50 mem 0. Should be seeing 16-18mh
921,"undervolt your card, you are mining at a loss without it, see your Nicehash window, it is literally showing you are -0.23 everyday..

after undervolt you slowly up your core, +15 at a time and bench it with your hashrate.

also, check if you are mining x16r2 or x16r? x16r is ridden with asic, you will never see profit mining that algo."
922,I am having trouble zooming in. What is the hashrate? Is that a 1660? 1660ti?
923,My 1660 non Ti with 75% power +100 on the core and -502 memory does 17-18mhs avg on T-Rex miner
924,Why aren't you using your CPU?
925,My 1050ti seems to be pulling over double them numbers something isn't right
926,Average
927,"That's weird. I get between 18-21MH/s on my 1660Ti, but I'm not using NH, I'm using the newest T-Rex on Suprnova"
928,"well first NEVER EVER EVER run at 100% power limit, even if your temps are fine the power draw creative to hashrate isn't worth it, beyond that it looks like you are on X16r which you shouldn't be on, Ravencoin (the most valuable coin) forked off of X16r to X16rV2, if you do not have X16rV2 in your algo list then you need to update the build of Nicehash you are using, there are now ASIC's all over the old X16r coins and as such there is no money to be made, you could also do with some tuning of your GPU in general, 0 and 0 is not where you want your core and mem clocks at. Also the X16 algo's have a wildly varying hashrate that changes every minute or so so a small snapshot like this doesn't paint the entire picture."
929,"To mine successfully, you have to:

1. Overclock your GPU's memory (for ETH algo)
2. Undervolt the GPU core (to save on electricity)

Here is a complete mining guide which I used to boost mine: [https://cryptoit.blogspot.com/2018/08/how-to-undervolt-nvidia-1060-1070-1080ti.html](https://cryptoit.blogspot.com/2018/08/how-to-undervolt-nvidia-1060-1070-1080ti.html) (it works the same on 1660Ti too)"
930,"Update NHM.

You are probably using some old NHM version, which still supports X16R(old one). Raven forked from X16R to X16Rv2. We have removed X16R from the newer versions.

Make sure that you download NHM from here: 
https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMiner/releases"
931,"You can joint RedPandaMining Discord https://discord.gg/jAyc5V ,  people will help you there  , more helpful then some of the comments I read here"
932,basic bitch
933,Hey. What vendor 1660ti are you using please leave detailed description thanks.
934,1660ti 7.5 mhs
935,"Ahahaha I that you , familiar name , Panda Family"
936,"Nice hash said it was not profitable, although it doesn't seem like the gpu is either lol"
937,because unless he is paying less the 5 cents per KWH he would be losing money for the next month until RandomX comes along.
938,What clock settings?
939,"That is usually true, except for Grin.  I've noted that hash rates on Grin31 scale relatively proportionally to the power utilization.  Thus mining at 100% power limit makes sense, if you have the right kind of PSU to supply that power consistently and safely.  I tried running at 105% for a while, but cut back because I hadn't spec'ed the PSUs to be able to handle that much power (because I, like you, expected to undervolt).  Nevertheless, it continued to scale up even beyond 100%."
940,"Msi ventus i think it is, Thanks."
941,"Too low, did you try any other algorithm? These are the best suit with Ryocurrency. Give it a try."
942,Yes
943,"Eh, keep stacking sats. I'd run the CPU too!"
944,"For a single CPU cant be  losing , hes already using around 60-80 watts  for having the computer ON , another 20-30 watts increase by mining with the CPU"
945,"stock mem/core on x16rv2 
power is at like 90%"
946,"Yes Grin does scale the best but it's still not 100% linearly and even then if you are mining on Nicehash like the OP is you don't want to have your GPU's at 100% power limit for all the other algo's as it bounces between algo's, you gotta find that ""sweet spot"" settings that can be used for virtually any algo in the top 5 earning algo's."
947,Does it have silver around the fans?
948,"I wouldn't, it definitely is NOT profitable, not for another month, I was big into CPU Mining last year when a CPU like this would bring in well over a dollar a day by itself, I was earning enough from my CPU's (across my rigs) to cover my power costs leaving the GPU's as pure profit. But then difficulty kept rising as more and more GPU's came into Monero and the other Cryptonight coins, with how things are now CPU's like this are constantly getting disconnected from teh server because they haven't submitted a share within the time window Nicehash gives and in reality your CPU earnings are about 40% LESS then what the Nicehash Miner shows as your estimated daily earnings (I was able to track this very closely on the old Nicehash Platform because my CPU's where the only thing that mined the Cryptonight algo since I'm all Nvidia GPU's and so I was able to compare my actual earnings to what the miner showed, the Difficulty is simply too high to make money with anything short of a Ryzen 9 3900X and even then you are spending $500 on a CPU that can be out performed by a $200 GPU until the RandomX fork next month."
949,"properly configured thats closer to another 70 watts and the earnings on it are crap, trust me i have a Ryzen 7 1700, i've done the math."
950,Yes
951,"What all y'all are failing to recognize is that profitability SHOULD NOT MATTER when you're talking about freaking  20 cents a day. Run the son of a bitch and eat the few dollars in the short term. Mining won't be practical forever. God forbid the OP loses 10 cents a day until RandomX comes out. Oh, the humanity??? How will he afford to feed his kitties!!! Lol."
952,"For 200 bones, you can run the 2700x. I think it benchmarks at half of what the 3900x does, but hell, mining is a boring hobby, just run any Ryzen and you got a dog in the hunt. I can't justify buying a 3900x, as I just don't care that much. A pre-owned 1700 will do just fine."
953,"There is no math to do , looks you haven't researched at all. You can't mine when value of the coin is higher,  you don't even have an idea how much difficult goes up once a coin get a good price. 
I mine a loss but is low difficulty too"
954,"PROFITABILITY IS KEY!!!!!!!!! Profitability doesn't mean that you are selling, it means that you are acquiring the MAXIMUM amount of the coin for the dollar investment.

WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU MINE AT A LOSS, THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING YOU COULD DO.

Let me explain this for the 5 MILLIONTH TIME, say it costs you $1 dollar to mine 50 cents worth a coin, why would you not just BUY a $1 of the coin and have TWICE AS MUCH COIN????????????"
955,OH MY GOD are you RETARDED? Why in the world would you mine if you are LOSING MONEY? If you are trying to gather coins to sell later when a coin value goes up then you want to get as much coin for as cheap as possible and if the choice is mine 0.5 coin or buy 1 at the same costs why in the world would you mine?
956,Depends on the conductors in the cables...  I would assume they are NOT rated for 13A if they have a 5A fuse by default.   I would recommend not using them w 13A fuses.  Sorry.  Not the answer you wanted to hear but not worth starting a fire to save a few bucks.
957,"unlikely, only reason they would have a lower fuse in them is because they are thinner wire not capable of handling the higher current."
958,"UK - the majority of those leads I've seen/dealt with are made for low current, the copper in there is basically the bare minimum they can get away with. 

Rewirable IEC female and a 13a plug is about £2, 3 core 2.5mm is less than £2 a meter. That's what I do so I can have the lead as long/short as I need it, at those prices why risk it."
959,The amp rating of the cable is written on the three pin end....
960,"A wires amp rating is based on the wire gauge and in special circumstances that don't apply here, the insulating material. Fuses are determined based on the intended load at the end of the wire but it is safe to assume a manufacture wouldn't waste too much money oversizing the wire. If you can guess the gauge you can look up the amp rating all over the internet by searching ""wire AWG table"". If you have a hand held ohm meter you can measure the resistance and the length of a wire in your cable and figure out the gauge with the information in the same AWG tables. As a last resort you could just try it, put your computer under full power load and feel how hot the wire gets. If it gets hot, don't use it. It won't instantly burst into flames or anything."
961,Don't do it.  Even if they work they will get hot and eventually give issues.
962,"Do not cheap out and do this. 

If the draw is high, a cable rated to 5A could melt or start a fire before the 13A fuse would pop and prevent it.

We had this sort of thing highlighted as dangerous and requiring an immediate fix in a UK landlords electrical safety report (30A cable, 40A fuse)"
963,"How about just using nice cheap fuseless cables?

I don't think I've ever actually *seen* a PC power supply cable with a fuse in it... Is that UK thing?"
964,"2.5 mm is 0.0004971 rods

^^^[WHY](/r/UselessConversionBot/comments/1knas0/hi_im_useless/)"
965,So it is!  Bingo.. says can handle 10A.  Cable also says 0.75mm^2.  is that enough for 10A?
966,"Yes, it is the best advice I've seen here in the comments box."
967,It's a UK thing
968,"All devices in the UK have a fuse in the plug, the only things that don't are things like toothbrushes and electric shavers that plug into a fused outlet."
969,It is yes. Maybe fit with 9a fuse.
970,"you need to research ProgPOW for Ethereum and RandomX for XMR.  You may want to look at CPU mining instead of GPU mining.  If you want to go the GPU route, look into cards with GDDR6, they hash better on the upcoming algos.  Based on what you have up there, you want the 1660 TIs, as they are the only ones with GDDR6.  Also look at whattomine.com"
971,"Don't get it if you are sleeping in the same room as the mining rig, it will disrupt your sleep and make your room very hot in summer. If you want to mine I would get a gaming PC with a 2080ti that you can leave on at night, it won't get too much space and it won't make much noise or heat. Plus you can game on it and have fun. 
There are no profits at the moment even with free electricity it's not worth it, especially if you plan to sell every month..to get less than 100$. Not worth it"
972,Many colleges will have no mining clauses in the contracts for living on campus.
973,"I disagree with all the other comments here about 'profitability' and 'coin prices'. Let me be clear: by building this rig, the value you will get from the coins mined is insignificant.  Forget about potential profit, market conditions and electric costs. The **real** value in owning a mining rig is that you gain technical knowledge, experience and opportunities. It's clear that the blockchain industry isn't going to get any smaller than it is right now. The only way is up.

I was around your age when I built my first rig with 3 R9 270's, for mining LTC and Dogecoin. That rig only earned me $1000. But by getting into the crypto industry, and starting bigger and bigger farms after that, I invested in my skills. In the end, the value I gained from mining is set to be thousands of dollars a year. I put myself on the fast track to a high-paying job straight out of college. The funny thing is that I lost $20,000 from my third farm, but those losses will be recouped in a few years because of the higher salary I can get.

So go ahead and assemble the rig, and don't worry about the profit or losses. In college, you can gain a few friends by showing off your rig and hardware skills. If you're going to major in computer science, your rig is a platform for running cryptography, AI, and deep learning programs on. Forget about a few hundred bucks of gains/losses and focus on the long term bottom line.

I think GTX 1660 Ti's are a good choice to keep power usage down, but you could try used GTX 1060's or 1070's. But I recommend nVidia no matter what, since a lot of big data applications are built around CUDA, and the newer coin algorithms favor nVidia.

However, be careful mining at college:

* Some dormitory rooms share branch circuits. This is especially for older dorm hall buildings from the 1960s-1980s. If another kid nearby runs a vacuum cleaner or space heater, you could trip the breaker. If you trip the breaker too many times, you could get discovered.
* Your college might have a policy against mining. If you're caught, you could even be kicked out of on-campus housing
* You need to attach a kill-a-watt meter to your rig, and balance the load of all your appliances. You need to pause your mining rig whenever you use a microwave or hairdryer
* You won't be able to mine 24/7 if it gets too hot inside your dorm room. If you have a roommate, don't expect anything.
* In your case, you won't really profit much from the free power. Electricity is pennies compared to knowledge/experience. Consider keeping your rig at your parent's house and remoting into it"
974,Skip the rigs for now. If you think crypto is going to go up buy some now while it's down. Use the profits to get yourself a nice laptop for school.
975,"Maybe you will understand it in monetary terms.
1 card if u lucky will make about $0.30 a day...now what you paying for a 6 card rig and how long will it take to pay itself off at those rates?"
976,"Lol I was literally in your shoes a few years ago, if you want to start mining college is the time to do it with that sweet sweet free electricity. Here’s the break down. 1660s are a great choice at current market standings. With 2 you’ll make about 60 cents a day. With 5 rx580, remember to get the 8gb cards if you choose this path, you’ll be making around $1.70 a day. Seems like an easy choice right? Eeehhhh the draw backs of rx580s is that you will need a big power supply to power them, over 1000w psu, which is pricy(look up power consumptions charts for accurate number) Also your room will become an oven because the cards get hot which then leads to the fans roaring while you try to sleep and your life will be miserable, trust me because that’s literally what I did for over a year. Honestly, I would go with the 1660s because they will make you less miserable and may prove to be the better investment in the long run. But at the end of the day, youre a grown boy now you gotta make the choices. Also here is a list of parts you will need and the guesstimated prices.

Motherboard: 80$
Intel cpu: 35$  
1 stick of ram:22$
5 risers: 30-50$
1000w psu: 160$ or 750w psu: $80
Nice metal case:35$ or diy plywood case 15$
120gb ssd: 20$
Power switch(optional could always jump the board with a screw driver): 5$
Dummy plug(again optional):10$"
977,"u are dreaming, its like with the invention of cars, you want to buy some horses to use as transportation. GPU era has passed already, its ASIC only now"
978,"It’s better to buy btc and hodl, even if you have free power at school."
979,1660ti's are good choice if you are going to mine CN-GPU (Ryocurrency )
980,"I like the idea of building a badass going computer with an extra GPU. It will be more practical. And easier to say to the college that you aren't mining. (Kinda hard to hide 5 GPUs) 

I'd say a high end Ryzen and a 2080 ti or 5700xt and you will do fine. ( Don't skimp on the psu. More wattage is better)"
981,"Kid, listen. You're going to lose money with this thing. If that's fine with you and you just want cool computer equipment around that heats your room then get your rig.

If you're thinking this is going to pay you while you're there then even with free electricity man... its still a wash.

What's your actual goal?"
982,"Thank you for a serious reply. Since i'm a ""kid"" my question gets downvoted lol.  I will defiantly check that out, again I appreciate a valid response taking me seriously."
983,"Yeah, I slept with an 8-card 1080TI mining rig last summer and it disrupted the shit out of my sleep. Kept the room hot, and the noise was really annoying."
984,"your parts list doesn't flow with the current market and the way things are shifting in the mining scene, 1 stick of RAM and a dirt cheap celeron isn't gonna jive anymore for these newer algorithms that exist now, you need a nice Ryzen CPU for the RandomX fork (which by my math will see even a Ryzen 1700 earning more then a 5 card RX580 rig by itself, at least for the next little while), you also need a decent amount of system ram for some of these algo's, the old single 4GB stick method doesn't work. Truth is you are better off building a Gaming PC to resell when you realize you won't make your money back then building a dedicated mining rig like what made money 2 years ago."
985,"actually they aren't, the 1660 Super is coming in a matter of DAYS and will come in like $70 cheaper with faster GDDR6"
986,Goal would be to make some $ (not get rich) with the free electricity. If some  of the cards were working when I have made a profit I would sell them off for anything I could get.
987,"nothing to do with you being a ""kid"", more to do with the number of times this has been discussed in this subreddit, even with free power starting now you are gonna lose money on your time frame.

Also re-reading your original post you are another year and a half away from going to college and you want to buy hardware today to use then? That just makes me shake my head, do you not see the constant advancements in hardware nearly every year? don't buy stuff today that will be worthless for mining before you even get to college and you wanna know how BAD mining is right now, you could litterally take the money you would put into building a mining rig today, lock it away in a CD at a bank for a year and you will have more money then if you mined for the next year, thats how bad things are, hell a regular savings account would have a better return then buying mining hardware today.

don't buy hardware you can't even mine with for another year and a half before you get the free power."
988,I slept with 200 video cards and they didn't keep the room warm enough.
989,"Oh stop, you’re gonna make me pee from laughing so hard...you think the majority of rx580s are mining monero. The only real people getting hit with the fork is Vega owners. Using rx 580s to mine monero has never been the most profitable thing. The only reason to mine monero is for the speculative market and hope that it goes somewhere which it hasnt. Also any rx580s mining on monero are just going to switch over to something else that’s basically going to have similar returns. The problem with cpu mining is it’s not practical to run a farm or multiple units at a time. Unless you have money oozing out the butt there is no longer going to be individual scalability for monero, just gonna be everyone gets one soup bowl like a communist Gulag."
990,"You aren't gonna make a profit though, thats what you aren't seeing GPU Mining in on the cusp of going the way of the Dodo Bird, even with FREE POWER you need 3+ years of steady earnings at current rates to BREAK EVEN on your hardware costs and earnings are only getting worse (they've dropped 6-7% in the last 2 weeks alone), the TL;DR of it all is hardware bought today WILL NEVER TURN A PROFIT, the hardware is going to LOSE VALUE faster then it earns crypto, especially after the RandomX fork next month, their will be a tsunami of worthless used AMD GPU's flooding the market which is gonna just be the start of the new phase of mining rig liquidations, the next few years are gonna be brutal on the used GPU market as you'll be seeing them selling for pennies on the dollar because there will be just so many of them.

You are better off completely changing your mindset and see mining as a method of subsidizing your gaming rig / personal computer, build a badass Ryzen 3000 based gaming rig with 1 or 2 higher end GPU's that you can then use for years, don't expect to ever break even."
991,"Listen kid, he is right. There's other ways to explore mining than build a full rig

are you bringing a desktop to college? If so grab a pcie1x to 4x usb risers and toss and extra gpu or two in/outside the case

or just get a last year gen gaming laptop with a 1060 or so and have it gpu/cpu mine while you sleep

this rigs DO get HOT especially in those small dorm rooms! expect 10+ degrees.

they are also LOUD - expect a roommate to complain about being too noisy at night"
992,found the Antarctica explorer
993,Hmm...
994,"> you think the majority of rx580s are mining monero

you think the GPU's Mining Monero aren't gonna switch to the shit the RX580's are currently mining, further decreasing the profits for RX580's?

And dude it's simple math, a Ryzen 7 1700 hashes about 3.5-4 times faster then a Vega64 on RandomX so it should earn at least that 3.5x the earnings of a Vega64 today which is roughly in line with a 5 card 580 rig earnings. It doesn't matter what the 580's are mining (which is why I never said they where mining Monero, FYI), the earnings on CPU's are gonna be stupid high for Ryzen Owners and since farms aren't gonna upgrade CPU's it's the perfect time for a small scale single rig miner to make a little money."
995,"No, the room was 125x50x20 ft. and it was the middle of winter. It was 67° inside the room."
996,"If Monero RandomX is going to be so profitable, why won't everybody and their uncle with a CPU flock to it, and then drive the profit down to a reasonable level?"

998,">uncertainty of how long the profits will hold out for

The extra risk will negate the extra profit, then.

>you think farms are gonna be able to find 100's of them or hell even dozens of them?

This is the only good reason I can find that supports your argument. This is exactly what happened in Q3 2017. Existing benchmarks show that AMD is 50-70% faster than Intel's 14nm+++ 9th gen CPUs with the same cores/threads. I think it's because Zen 2 has large cache. But Intel plans to cut prices in half, so I don't know if that will change anything.

Even then, I think individual gamers with Ryzen 3000 CPUs will have the biggest advantage. They already bought their rig for gaming anyway, which means they didn't take any risk. A commercial farm won't be at an advantage because they can only have one CPU per rig, and they're shouldering all the risk of having just 1-2 coins available. If there are quantity limits on the R9 3900x/3950x, then large operations won't be able to order so many of them. In February 2018, I had to deal with maximum quantities even from wholesale distributors.

>Farms aren't gonna take a risk and spend a thousand dollars per machine to upgrade to R9 3900X's

Agreed. The gamers who bought R9 3900x's and attached RGB lights and liquid coolers to them will make a killing.

For me, a mining rig has to not only make profit after electricity, but pay for itself and the risks it involves. I need a 30% return on the hardware per year and 25% to compensate for the risk of mining. So a $1000 rig needs to make $550/year, or $1.50/day. A R9 3900x uses $0.20 of power/day at 8¢/kWh. It makes $0.46/day of revenue on CNr. That number would need to quadruple for me to consider building the rig. And once you factor in the risk of RandomX, I would need a little more profit. We're not considering the extra depreciation risk of CPUs these days. AMD is making big advancements every generation.

Conclusion: RandomX revenue needs to be 5-6x as high as CNr currently is for commercial farms to consider investing in it.

Yes, you can add GPUs to the rig to make it more worthwhile. Or you can drop that 3900x into an existing rig for $600-650 of total cost. So now the 3900x needs to make $1.18/day of revenue, which is still 2-3x as high as CNr today."
999,"> Conclusion: RandomX revenue needs to be 5-6x as high as CNr currently is for commercial farms to consider investing in it.

comparing current 3900X benchmarks to Vega 64's (puts 3900X's about 65% the hashrate of a Vega64) and knowing post the post fork hashrates put 3900X's 10-11 times the speed of a Vega 64 the math says that at least initially a 3900X should be 6.5-7.5 times more profitable (before power) then it is right now, not accounting for new machines that will come online due to the increased profitability.

Except that most farms are running budget Celerons in 1151 boards so in order to swap over to a 3900X there will have to be MOBO upgrades and possibly PSU upgrades depending on how the rig is configured as you will now have the added wattage of a CPU mining that you didn't have"

1001,">Except that most farms are running budget Celerons in 1151

Yes, that's right. I was giving the best case example, where a farm owner used cheap B450 AM4 motherboards and low cost $40-50 AM4 processors. 80% of farm owners would have to replace the whole platform if they wanted to install a R9 3900x.

I'd argue that it's time to stop building Intel Celeron platform rigs, and switch over to AMD. Their low end CPUs are now cheaper than Intel's. Back in 2017-2018, you couldn't find an AM4 CPU for < $100, but now you can."

One of the other hurdles back then was also the lack of integrated graphics, now that there are $40 AMD CPU's that have integrated graphics there is no reason to do an intel system if building new, but this is more about what the current state of the mining scene is and the overwhelming majority are those celeron guys."

For undervolting I used this guide: [https://cryptoit.blogspot.com/2018/08/how-to-undervolt-nvidia-1060-1070-1080ti.html](https://cryptoit.blogspot.com/2018/08/how-to-undervolt-nvidia-1060-1070-1080ti.html)"

1009,"Yeah you're good to go. These cards draw 120W at 100% power, so 8x120=960W, your PSU can handle it.

Assuming you're smart and you go with at least 75% power limit on your cards, you will draw only (8x120)\*0.75=720W, so again, you're ok by a good margin.

1118,"Yeah my rtx 2070s never hit 60, granted I have a lot of fans, but if you can't keep a nvidia card below 70, I wouldn't. Tbf I wouldn't mine with 1060 at all."

1123,"I ignored all the advise and spent \~$2300 on a (3) 2070 Super mining rig, using Hive OS. I also mine on my gaming computer when I'm at work, it has a single RTX 2080. My power cost is 5.7 cents so I make $1.50 to 2.50 a day after power mining RVN (1 month sample size). I actually plan on getting another card or 2 (hoping for some black friday deals). It's a hobby and if prices continue I'll probably never recoup my costs, but its fun. So I would treat it as a hobby and if you're in it for money I would look into other avenues.

Edit: Forgot to add I built it in a milk crate with a pvc pipe running across it to support the risers and GPUs, thing is ghetto fabulous. I also bought a watt meter from the hardware store and it pulls about 600w.

1125,"Mining is \*almost\* always a bad idea (unless you're setting up wearhouses of GPUs with near free electricity perhaps) - compared to just buying cryptocurrency.  


That said, its fun to mine and the hardware is cool.  


You have to ask yourself ""Am I trying to make a lot of money doing this?"" - if so then you should opt out of mining and just buy some crypto.  If you are ""This mining stuff is cool, I love the hardware and I probably can make non-optimal profits"" then go for it."
1126,"quickly going by what to mine, if you had a rig of 8 1660ti's you'd mine about $2.50/day of Raven coin. Assuming stable crypto prices and stable difficulty (all best case scenarios) it would take you 800 days to make your money back on the $2000 spent on GPUs alone. 

Short answer: don't, now is not the time to be mining"
1127,"the 1700 was a great CPU miner when it was profitable to CPU mine, but it simply isn't for another month and a half until the Monero RandomX fork on November 30th, at that power cost you can totally turn a profit with a 1080ti, the break even point for a TitanXp (basically a 1080ti+5%) at 80% power limit is 11.5 cents per KwH so a 1080ti would be very similar.

Seems like pennies or not worth it , but i thought same thing when I started with Ethereum when it was $7 and electricity was .21 cents for me!
Sadly I only did a couple of months  mining for science with (2) sli 970's ($200 each used in 2016) and 4 280x's I got for cheap ($100 each).
Mined 7 ethereum in 3 months and bought 7 for $70 and hodl and daytraded away to lear and saved up a little btc.  I did ok not great(SHOULD HAVE PULLED OUT AT LEAST %50 WHEN ETH HIT $1,500 USD EACH) , and that money is still; buying me hardware today!"
1130,"If you are careful and snipe good deals on Amazon or Ebay, you can get a full 8x GPU rig for about$3k. I was able to snag 8x RTX 2070 for about $350 each, then all the other peripherals for another $300-$400. Earns about $4.50/day on GrinCuckaroo29 on Nicehash via HiveOS."
1131,"Just because your daily revenue clears the power cost doesn't mean mining is a good idea. You have to make sure your daily profit is enough to give you a decent return on the hardware.

For me, I would only build a GPU rig if it could return 30% + 25% on the hardware. The 30% is the average depreciation of GPU rigs per year, and I add a 25% discount rate to reflect the high risk and changing conditions of this industry. 55% x $1000 = $550 per year. So if the rig costs $1000, I would need $1.50/day of profit to justify the fact that the rig's value is going down by 0.1% a day, and the risks of building it.

For $1000, I could build a rig with 7 RX 570's, and each one would mine $0.30/day of ETH or XMR. The rig would earn $2.10/day of revenue. In order to earn the required profit, the power cost would have to be < $0.60/day. 120w/card x 7 cards x 24 hours = 20.16 kWh/day. That means the highest electric rate I can have is 2.97¢/kWh. Even the cheapest regions of the world cost 3.5-5¢, and my power is 16-18¢. So I would not build the rig. I would only build it if the revenue was $4.93+/day for the rig, or 2.5x as high as right now.

It's up to you to decide what return you need on your rig."
1132,"You can also think about building a rig and rent it out. e.g. using  [https://vast.ai/](https://vast.ai/)

Then you have an alternative if coin prices going down."
1133,"Mining while today's daily profit is an excellent idea if you can afford to gain nothing in the end.  I recall mining ETH for the entire 2016 at a loss.  ETH was $5-10 at that time.  It wasn't until mid 2017 did crypto take a big rise, and mining speculatively paid out, if you held the coins."
1134,This is exactly what my first two rigs looked like!
1135,If you're really planning on getting into it I would focus on being efficient.  The 20xx series is still pretty bad bang for your buck so far as mining goes.
1136,Definitely worth looking into as most power bills have a section for creation of the power and a separate section for delivery.  One other thing to look out for is that the power company may charge you a much lower rate for say the first 50 kw hours and then the rate jumps up significantly after that so if you are not paying attention your rate looks much lower than it is in reality.
1137,Why not mine grin or eth instead then. Since both are currently more profitable
1138,"Amazon just  put up basic 5700 for $290

1139,imagine how much more Eth you could have bought for what you spent in power instead of mining at a loss.
1140,I went according to what was most profitable on whattomine at the time I wrote the post. Could have changed a bunch since then but pretty sure ETH is never most profitable
1141,"Playing the what if game when it comes to crypto is the same as the what if game when it comes to stocks.  We could all say “what if I had bought apple stock when it was $8 a share or Amazon at $6, I’d be rich!”  

If there was no chance or you weren’t even thinking about it, then it’s a moot point to even think about it."
1142,"You completely missed my point, my point was mining at a LOSS is STUPID!!!!!!! 

Here's why, either you are selling instantly in which case you are losing money or you are Hodling hoping the value will recover in which case your goal should be to acquire as much as you can for your dollar and if you can BUY MORE of the crypto then you can mine for the same dollar amount then you should be BUYING.

This has nothing to do with hindsight and predicting the future, this has to do with DON'T POINTLESSLY WASTE MONEY that regardless of what happens equates to you having LESS money then you could have had. Even if you bought crypto and it went down you still would lose less then if you mined at a loss and crypto went down."
1143,"you DON'T the ""secondary speed"" is because you are dual mining EtHash and something else. that said something else is a different hashrate scale and just a waste of power to be honest."
1144,"The electricity not paying, so I won’t have to worry about that if doing cpu"
1145,"Oh ok thanks, yea the multipoolminer is showing multiple miners active but it doesn’t seem that way when it comes to profits. I guess I’ll have to see in the next few days if mpm is BS or not.

Any way to change config to just mine Monero, eth and maybe RVN coins only?"
1146,"I'm sure there is, the biggest thing would be to adjust your bat file for Claymore so it's not dual mining because there is nothing worth dual mining anymore, RVN would require using a different miner completely from Claymore, but the Multipoolminer probably has those other miners, I don't have any experience with that particular miner to be able to advise you to that extent of how to configure it, I can just tell you 100% for sure that secondary speed is from dual mining within Claymore."
1147,"Thanks greatly appreciated , you think it’s worth using multipoolminer or using anything else?

I’m looking into mining Monero and Ofcourse eth, possibly rvn not sure to be honest.

1148,"honestly you just gotta research what algo's are best for the hardware, not much point in CPU mining unless you just have stupid cheap electricity (like sub 5-6 cents per KwH) for now, but things should change at the end of November. I have no idea what algo's run best on the V100's, thats out of my wheel house.

what you wanna do is find whatever pays the best in dollar equivalent then trade for whatever coin you wanna hodl or sell depending on if your goals are short term profits or long term investments."
1149,Why the hell would you tell them.??
1150,I'm confused did you tell them you where mining on it?
1151,An update: They ended up offering me an RMA anyway. I've learned my lesson. Avoid telling them at any cost.
1152,"Mining is no different than gaming, in fact it is less stressful to the card if done right (i.e. no coin switching, lowered voltages).

It is just a way for them to get out of their commitment to honor the warranty me thinks. Never tell them that you are mining with it, it is indistinguishable from gaming and they have no right to know anyway as long as you make use of the cards within its functional limit (I.e, no overvolting or high temperatures)"
1153,"Their warranty is good...used it many times...

You just did it wrong OP.

I always setup my warranties one at a time via a different email, I simply hosted my own domain with unlimited emails and I simply create a new email account for each card when buying buying and adding new cards. When I need to do an RMA I log into that particular email account from cpanel and boom all the warranty info is there. When I'm asked about the card....I leave out the part of that card being in a mining rig and lie my ass off and tell them my little smart ass brother beat the hell out of the card playing fortnite or some bullshit game like that. 

Is it 100% right? hell no but lets be honest...nothing is 100% right in the world."
1154,"biggest mistake you did was telling you were mining. never, NEVER tell that or your warranty is instantly gone with every manufactor"
1155,This has been their policy for about 3 years now. You never tell them you mined with it mate
1156,"Now you will be forever linked to mining if asked for warranty, gameover for the rest of your life with evga gpu unless you create another account."
1157,"I don't understand why did you tell them that you are mining on these cards. They have done the right thing, I think."
1158,Don't tell them.

1160,"Unfortunately, yes."
1161,"> Mining is no different than gaming, in fact it is less stressful to the card if done right

Source on this?"
1162,"If done right, EVGA doesn't know what each person does. LOTS of people are not ""that"" into it. 

I don't know if it is better or not but EVGA can't cherry pick obviously.

NOTE: I'm absolutely not saying you're wrong."
1163,">Mining is no different than gaming, in fact it is less stressful to the card if done right 

Stop with the bullshit. I ran a mining operation and I can promise you that mining IS ALWAYS more stressful than gaming. 

You dont game 24/7/365 , but you do mine non stop. 

I had PLENTY of cards leaking oil from memory thermal pads and fans that would stop working. You could often tell because the bearings would squeal for some time. Fans DO fail and mining causes it. 

The GPU itself might not be damaged, but the cards have miles on them, make no mistake. Thermal grease can dry up too leading to increased temps."
1164,"That's what I thought. What's Nvidia's main market? AI. AI arguably pushes card harder than mining ever could. Gaming stresses a card the same amount if not harder than mining, thus why risers use 1 PCIe lane instead of all 16.

I didn't even overclock it"
1165,"WHY? That's like answering the cop when he asks ""do you know why I pulled you over?"" (FYI, ALWAYS say NO if you are in that situation, thats a cop phishing you to admit of wrong doing and potentially something other then what he actually pulled you over for)."
1166,Just wait a couple months and try again.  this time dont say you use it to mine.
1167,"I am not sure if there is an official source on this, but pretty much most old miners will confirm. I had a HD 5850 running for years, nothing ever happened to it, another that was used for gaming instead had issues by  the 3rd year. It is anecdotal, I know, but those with bigger farms can give much better anecdotes than mine.

Fans do fail from time to time, but in general having stable voltage at good temperatures is no much different than having a card staying idle. It is also how server farms can stay online for decades even, with relatively minimal damages: good ventilation, stable voltage."
1168,Mining on my ROG laptop with a 1070 for like 3 years now. Have a 7 card array I've had going for \~3 years also. No failures.
1169,"You are honestly the first that runs a mining operation that tells me this.

All the people I know run them in well ventilated areas where the temperatures (of the cards) do not extend a certain threshold which can cause the issues you are talking about.

My understanding is that they keep the temps to 60 C or less which is similar to the idle temperatures in many cards (low 50s in some places).

So yes, according to a c certain use that you can possibly do to cards mining is less stressful than regular gaming (which extends temperatures to highs 70s or 80s, or indeed non-stable voltage).

In my very limited experience, my gaming card died before my ""mining card"" due to the above issues.

But yeah I did leave a window for improper use during mining, which can -indeed- trash the cards. Obviously mining can be card for your card(s), I wrote that if done in a certain way it won't. Last guy I talked to had 300 cards running for 3 years only 3 developed issues. That ' s a turnaround of 1 card per 100. Yeah, that's better than gaming in them."
1170,"if you dont underclock and undervolt and make a decent fan curve (not 100% fan), then you are effectively running your GPU too hard and it will diminish its lifespan by a lot.  If you run a GPU 100% load at 50c with 40% fans and very low voltage, and lower clocks then it will not diminish its lifespan vs gaming.  whether its using pcix1 or x3 doesnt make a difference, thats just bandwidth."
1171,"AI is supposedly done by professionals, so no improper care of the cards. Mining is a semi industrial activity often done by amateurs. But so is gaming, especially serial gaming, so really the only way to lose your warranty is by telling them. 

BTW what can trash a card has nothing to do with bandwidth, it has more to do with sudden changes in voltage and/or high temperatures, both can possibly allow electron tunneling which -if done enough- affect the proper functions of the card.

But like I said gaming does way more of the above than (proper) mining where voltages are generally stable (coin switching can be bad for a card though, NiceHash and the likes, in the long term) and temperatures as well can be withing certain limits without sudden spikes in either direction.

IMO most mining ""accidents"" have/had to do with improper handling / static prevention than the actual mining process. Most people have few ideas how to properly ground their custom rigs which as well can create issues long term. But again, it is not ""mining's fault"""
1172,"I know. I have no idea why I said that, and I hate that I did"
1173,"The fans will always been an issue, they will always be on. 

As for the temps, it all depends on what algo you mine and what brand cards you have. I ran Nvidia, where you could not run some ultra low voltage BIOS for Eth only. I dual mined too so the cards were maxing out. 

All depends but fans are pretty much a guaranteed issue."
1174,"That's probably what happened then. Admittedly, I'm relatively inexperienced with this. I'll definitely do that next time though."
1175,"AI is mostly done by professionals, but there are some amateurs in that space as well.

Thanks for the informative post, I didn't know that before. I was using bandwidth to illustrate my point, I know that's not the only factor.

Honestly, I get that they don't want to cover uninterrupted use, but there are other workloads that imply uninterrupted use than just mining."
1176,"If you're in UK or EU, you'll probably still have consumer rights."
1177,"Yeah, but fans are easy/cheap to replace. From the guy I talked he swaps them every 18-24 months. But yeah, indeed, he only mines in ultra low voltages so that he can sustain low temps without much hassle. Hulking cards are harder to maintain long-term, however I was responding to a guy who was equally mining on a low voltage/wattage card which very much paralleled what I am talking about."
1178,"nah, wasnt your fault, dont worry about it.  maybe tell evga you were mining at night or infrequently"
1179,"I'm in Canada, and bought the card on Amazon.com"
1180,"Ethereum. Probably 25 cents per 24 hours ball park.. that’s for the gpu.

1191,"Ooh this is interesting. What kind of CPUs do you think will be best for this, and what kinda revenue do you think they'll make?"
1192,"I'm in a third world country and they don't even know what mining is, or what a gpu, cpu etc. ... I run my pc 24/7 and sometimes on load and I mined before but I don't even remember what I mined, it was just like a tutorial for me for a week or so."
1193,Yup you can mine lots of things with a cpu.  But pennies a day.
1194,"Genuine question here, why did you make a second version for free when you also have a paid one for $4.99 instead of updating the paid version? I’m going to give it a shot regardless because I also use your Ethermine app (I think that’s you too? If it is, there’s a typo in it) and it has saved my ass so many times when my rig turned off or had an issue and the only reason I found out was because of the app.  

Edit: downloaded and using the app now, the estimated income button highlighter is very jarring with night mode on. The text is almost the same color as the highlight to let you know which button you’ve selected."
1195,"Great question and happy to answer. Before that, yes, Ethermine Mining Monitor is also made by me, typo should be fixed in the new update.

I made Blockwatch X because a lot of miners have asked for a free version of the app.   
The reasons for creating a separate app are the following:

\- the free version implements ads to help fund future development  
\- if I made the original app free and with ads, it wouldn't have been fair to the original customers  
\- since the original Blockwatch is encapsulated only on the device, there's no mechanism to verify who bought the app, not a simple one anyway  
\- having a separate app allows for testing ideas on a larger scale that can be implemented in the main app  


Thanks for the bug report, will get it fixed in the next update."
1196,What happens when the local PUD assumes you into an evolving industries rate and increases your power rate by 200%?
1197,"I think you'll get a lot of questions from this sub but I'll start with a few... I'm not sure I understand the 5% profit charge.  If the client is solo mining do you expect them to report their profits?  How is cooling managed?  Is it open air cooling or refrigerant-based?  Is there a guaranteed intake temperature?  How is power delivered?  120/240, single phase, 3 phase?  How are remote resets handled?  Customer provided power relays?"
1198,Nice clean facility. Price is too steep in current market and 5% is a total turn off
1199,What percentage of the rigs there are ASICS vs GPU'S?
1200,"We have a relationship with the PUD, as do many miners in our county. They just raised rates 3% for 2020 and we work with them and the public to solve power concerns. Any political concerns that arose during the last bubble have been addressed and the county is blockchain friendly. There is no “evolving industry rate.”"
1201,"Thanks for your questions!

* I switch the miners to mine for the company 72 minutes/day. It’s automatic. I never hold your funds; it’s always mining direct.

* Open air cooling, we pull in outside air. Pretty standard for farms out here.

* Power is 208 volt 3 phase. 

* I handle remote resets. We have 50 amp pro switched PDU’s that are internet enabled.

1213,"Best mining software is whatever is the best miner for your hardware that is supported by your OS, Best pool depends on the coin you are mining. These are not simple questions with simple answers, these answers change on a daily to weekly basis.

For Mining on Nicehash I prefer the latest build of the AngelBBS ""Nicehash Miner Legacy Fork Fix"" as it has all the algo's supported by Nicehash but with the best miners for every algo. For MPH and others you will need other multicoin miners, not a Fan of Awesome Miner, had trouble properly configuring that with MPH back when I tried to do that."

1227,"I’m using ibm so not by the hour. Plus not against tos. They flat out helped me customized specs for hashing purpose. I didn’t finalize since I wanted to make sure if this is the right fit. I was told to hyperthread to optimize hash rate

So I can use 2 mining softwares then? One for gpu and one for cpu (Monero)?

You think I should use multipoolminer or it might under utilize the gpu?"
1228,"I use gminer which has an ok fee. It's been working pretty well for cuda reliant Algos. I haven't tried other miner software.  

I'm also making an assumption that you should be able to dual mine a CPU algo and a GPU algo

I'm interested in what specs they customized for mining purposes. Also, unless they specifically had the upcoming Monero algo switch in mind idk why they would have been suggesting hyperthreading since that's CPU side and currently 99% of profitable coins are GPU based"
