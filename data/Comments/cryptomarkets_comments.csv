2,Why would anyone pay for anything with litecoin? Literally 0 benefit for the consumer.
3,"I don't get the joke, anyone can explain to me please ? I guess I missed something"
4,XRP is like a crappy penny stock in terms of an investment. It's rationale for existing is questionable.
5,"can anyone explain? why is there so much xrp hate right now? 

is it mainly because its centralized and controlled by its developers?"
6,Shitcoin dat one!
7,"I’ve warned people about XRP since before they pre sold it to their corporate investors. I love to day trade it but until all the people who are allowed to dump a billion a month into the market run out, its too risky to hold longterm."
8,Well.. ppl are also buying IOTACONNECT lmao
9,"This person is under 17 or has no idea what they're doing. 

I can tell you as an economist and someone with 15 years experience in investing, you either have not done proper research on XRP or you lack the qualifications to gauge sound investments if you are discounting XRP. 

Feel free to disagree. Time will prove me right."
10,"Yeah, they’re not solving any real world problems or making any real partnerships. Unlike the other 4,000 rainbow farting unicorn coins."
11,"Its deeply against the spirit of crypto in its implementation.


Decentralized is a spectrum, I think we all have to acknowledge that, but its on the far end of that spectrum towards ""centralized"" for things calling themselves cryptocurrency. 


It also kind of misses some of the game theory of crypto. If its free to transact, its free to attack via DDOS. People tout transaction speeds/fees, but wait until people give half a shit about this space.


Once its clear something is going to be around for ""forever"" its immediately obvious that it can't have cheap transaction fees or can't really be a cryptocurrency. Otherwise I can just write an app that uses its ""blockchain"" (quotes because its XRP) as a database and that game plays out until everyone finds out who has been fronting free storage space, because eventually they will be forced to stop doing that.


Once you understand the attack surface and all the game theory, you realize that Bitcoin is just legitimately the best this can really get without some huge breakthrough. The altcoins are a laundry list of parts of the game theory that various developers didn't understand."
12,Smh people who don’t do their research triggers me. We all know that BITCONNEEEEEECT is gonna outlast everything.

15,"Sure.

Based on the supply & demand curve, what is the value of an intermediate asset that's designed to be entered & exited rapidly with ease?

ie. If I buy 1 million XRP in EUD, and simultaneously sell 1 million XRP in USD, what does that do to the overall price of XRP?

Answer: If there is insufficient (liquidity) XRP to support the transaction then it affects the price. However, it also affects the usability of XRP for its intended purpose. If there is sufficient liquidity, it has exactly zero affect on the supply/demand price curve.

Compare this with Bitcoin or Monero which is used as a *store of value*. where the more people who store their value in the coin causes the demand to increase in relation to supply, the less people store their value in the coin, the lower the coin price.

The asset value of any token that is not designed to be a store of value, is near zero. Any price above that is being supported by speculation, and will eventually return to its intrinsic value.

Ripple the Company - well, that's a valuable thing. XRP the token... HODL on tight.

Time will tell if you're right, and XRP bounces back; or I'm right and XRP recovers in exactly the same way as NANO and IOTA have."
16,"It's centrally controlled, not transparent, isn’t mined, and is controlled by a single company. Additionally, it's *only* use case from a utility perspective is *banks*."
17,Downvoted by a bunch of people who read some marketing about some altcoin and think they're going to get rich by not understanding the game theory. Come at me bros. What sweet thing do you think you have figured out based on some ~~marketingpaper~~ whitepaper that nobody else has thought of? Happy to explain to you why you're wrong.
18,Hahaha hard agree
19,Good luck.

37,"**John Connally**

John Bowden Connally Jr. (February 27, 1917 – June 15, 1993) was an American politician. He served as the 39th Governor of Texas and as the 61st United States Secretary of the Treasury. He began his career as a Democrat and later became a Republican in 1973.

**Nixon shock**

The Nixon shock was a series of economic measures undertaken by United States President Richard Nixon in 1971, in response to increasing inflation, the most significant of which were wage and price freezes, surcharges on imports, and the unilateral cancellation of the direct international convertibility of the United States dollar to gold.While Nixon's actions did not formally abolish the existing Bretton Woods system of international financial exchange, the suspension of one of its key components effectively rendered the Bretton Woods system inoperative. While Nixon publicly stated his intention to resume direct convertibility of the dollar after reforms to the Bretton Woods system had been implemented, all attempts at reform proved unsuccessful. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system was replaced de facto by the current regime based on freely floating fiat currencies.

38,asking the real questions I see.
39,Underrated comment.
40,"Nope, becuase the people that get to touch the money first are already rich, and get to take advantage of the capital before the “market” feels the inflation.  By the time it trickles down to the peasants the money is worth less.  It’s called the cantillion effect."
41,"Yup. At this point, I just take all news with a grain of salt. 90% of the time it’s just over exaggerated drama. For example, a headline I saw the other day was ‘iPhone 11 still tracking users despite switching off location services’. The actual problem was that some apps simply didn’t have a location slider to turn off and used location services by default. Granted this is a different problem, but not the one the title would have you believe."
42,"Yes and no, in the context of what you've provided.

If you're just holding a shit load of cash, yes inflation leaves you at a loss because the value of what you have has been diluted.

Your context requires participation and leveraging the equalization of the extra money across an economy.

I'm not arguing the rich don't do that, but they have to if they want to remain rich, and there's a limit to it. The same method can also be used to mutiny an entire ruling class if done in excess."
43,I see what you mean. Apple have publicaly said privacy is not a thing with them but we already know this. Theres a great TED talk on some German guy who asked for his data from his telco company to see what they know about him. interesting video if you got a spare 20min.
44,"The problem with your hypothetical is rich people don’t hold mass amounts of cash, they borrow cheap and buy assets.  It’s the poor people that hold a high % in cash.

Why do you think all this money printing hasn’t caused inflation??  If they would have done the same QE but bailed out debtors instead of creditors we would have seen massive inflation.

Fun fact, it now takes 3$ of debt to create 1$ of GDP because the velocity of money is getting so low."
45,"Def not XRPL


nope. Look away."

Stupid for the holder to do such a big transfer w/o a test first but this just seems like a whale moving $ imo."

A very large whale is done accumulating and is taking his Bitcoin off the exchange, transferring it to hold for long term.

Or maybe Bittrex is hacked and 1/3 of total reserves are taken off exchange."
55,"No.  

If a whale wanted to take money off the exchange they don’t “wait to accumulate” $300m before taking it off the exchange.  They would take chunks off the table as they accumulate...

If Bittrex was hacked it wouldn’t be a secret.

More than likely it’s actually Bittrex moving money around, selling to pay bills, etc."

61,Why are people so into Ponzi schemes?
62,"It is indeed nice to see people embrace technological trends. However, some are yet to embrace these technologies because they may not be as informed as they ought to be on the subject matter (which is no fault of theirs). With conferences, summits, and workshops more of the Millennials are likely to embrace this technology because being informed is key. Which is why Chromia is passionate about educating the public on blockchain technology.  On the 9th of December, there will be a workshop for game developers which will further educate the public on the subject. More projects should embrace this approach, it is what brings adoption."
63,"Haha! Needed a laugh today, thanks bullshit article."
64,This article is posted literally weekly
65,This is not related to crypto
66,"Chromia relational and public blockchain technology is the key driving to more crypto adoption toward the exemplary of educating the public, that's why Chromia platform keeps moving from different crypto blockchain to another creating crypto expansion globally; Chromia platform will be at Berlin Tech of the year along side with TechCrunch one of the biggest Crypto technological platform in the world in Dec 11 and 12 and also Blockland solution conference held in Cleveland Ohio Dec 9 to 11, So Chromia will continuously spreading the information for quick cryptocurrency adoption"

92,def can't be true. some random shitcoin out there is probably doing a lot worse.
93,"Yeah the price sucks, but in terms of adoption it's the best in the crypto space by far. If any other coin had a fraction of the news Ripple and XRP had they'd pump hard.

But not a surprise that Ripple dumping on XRP holders would negatively influence the price. That excuse about adjusting to account for wrongly assessed volume wasn't very believable. They just wanted more money to fund their projects. And yes, fund the XRP ecosystem. Fair enough. But we all knew what they were doing. They just pushed it too far, and that has an effect on sentiment that's hard to recover in a market such as this currently.

Not selling my XRP though, after the endless amazing news over the last year along and everything being built I'm more bullish than ever on it's future. But short term? Probably gonna get rekt.

But meh what else is new? The entire market sucks right now."
94,"Reddit xrp community bashed me several months ago when I said xrp was going to .20 or lower when it was bouncing from .36 to .33

I can truly say I don’t feel sorry for those who said they put their life savings into it , got a second mortgage on their home and had all their bags packed. 

I was downvoted and bashed so hard I eventually left that Reddit community cause I got tired of the sheer madness and stupidity of the xrp army. 

Couldn’t believe so many people with less brains than a box of rocks were putting their money into xrp at that time screaming it was the bottom.

Xrp going back to .14 support then .10 support and if it breaks down below .10 definitely will see it hit .04 and slide down to .009 basically it will be worth zero before any price pumping."

EDIT:  Why am I labeled a Crypto God in this sub?  lol"
104,I am not part of the xrp army. I agree the youtubers and twitter personalities are absolutely ridiculous claiming it will be a new world reserve currency and such... but I don’t seem to understand how genuine good news from ripple is just overlooked by the majority of this sub..... the anti xrp army you could say
105,I am not convinced there's an XRP army. I've never met any of them. If its just some Guerrilla marketing firm this would make total sense from how they post online.
106,Makes sense when there a company selling 1b a month to moonbois hoping to get rich someday.
107,And then try to pretend it has no effect on price. Not even XRP holders buy that.
108,NEM looks like it's doing worse.
109,"Everyone talks shit about ripple dumping , then this month when they took the feedback on board and decided NOT to dump (they moved 100% of it back to escrow), people talk shit anyways.

The truth is people are going to hate ripple no matter what they do. Dump they hate, don’t dump they hate, big news the price drops, no news the price drops.

I’ll be happy to see when the big investors from Wall Street step into crypto, and do their research on which projects they want to invest in, and see which ones they like the most. Ripple is doing everything right in order to be successful on the global stage."
110,That's just it. Success of ripple the company has no effect on its price. They hold so much themselves that these partnerships buy from them directly. This has been said for years now. Burn rates are so low that this won't change soon.
111,That’s not correct. Look at IOTA. They are pretty much in the same situation. Big cooperations with big players. And every good news just dumps the price even more.
112,"After I helped my friends learn about and get into btc in 2017, I had a buddy who bought (not listening to me) 1k of xrp at .80 cents. It went up to 3.50 and (still not listening to me) didn’t take any profit. Last time we talked he said that he’s still adding to that position..... blows my mind"
113,Along with Linux.
114,"Hmm.. nope

2020 is the year of DeFi and ETH."
115,Irrational market.  People are just stupid in general.
116,Because XRP isn't decentralized.
117,Hahaha it is pretty ridiculous. It has become essentially a full time job (cult) for some
118,Maybe you should try interacting with them then? Just a thought.
119,Is NEM in the top 10? The article says “in the top 10”
120,"Ripple is trying to appeal to big banks and wall street first. I've even chatted with David Schwartz over twitter and he admits that that's where the marketing is directed at even though he thought it could probably be better targeted at people trying to do cross border payments.  That's why me and most people in the space hate it.  It's people that saw the power of blockchain and went directly to wall street with it.  Nothing changes.  

And the XRP army is real.  Just go on twitter and say anything even slightly negative about it, or disagree with Tiffany Hayden, and her white knight brigade shows up. A lot of smart people in XRP, but it just fundamentally goes against what most people think crypto is for. Then there's the fact that they own the majority of it. I know, I know ""hur durr but it's in escrow!!!"" Just cause it's in escrow doesn't mean they don't own it.  What kind of bullshit is that that they tricked all the dumbass newbies a couple years ago into thinking there's less supply than there is because it's in escrow? Gullible people that got into crypto went directly to XRP and became a cult that's now known as the ripple army.  Sounds like you're part of it too.  Sell now and get out.  now that the irrational exuberance is gone there's no reason for it to go up for a very long time.  Why would any big bank buy off an exchange when they can go directly to ripple and buy from them?  I know you're going to ignore this though cause cultists refuse to listen to anything bad about the cult they joined so good luck."
121,That’s insane! Lol
122,DeFi?! What kind of SHITCOIN is that?
123,"Yeah in crypto there is undeniably a lot of irrationality. But I also think that following price as a function of progress is irrational. When I look for true developments across the space it always seems to be that ripple is making the majority of them. Of course they are always blown out of proportion by the xrp army, but they are also always completely dismissed by others in the space. I do not understand the logic"
124,"Who cares? It has actual real world application, right now."
125,"I mean in person - there are plenty anons on the internet. I've met BTC people, ETH people, even EOS/BAT types. Never someone in person who thought XRP was something with legs (aside from briefly during the last bubble)."
126,"No, top 20 or 25, but the comment I was replying to said ""better than some random shitcoin out there"". Not some random shitcoin in the top 10. And the headline doesn't say top 10. This is reddit, how many of us actaully read the articles attached to these posts?"
127,"It sitting in escrow is just showing how much is going to be the total circulating supply eventually, so who cares? We know what the total supply of BTC and ETH will be, it just hasn’t been mined yet, there’s no difference there. Ripple releases one billion per month, and that has been known for years. Them releasing them each month is almost identical to BTC or ETH being mined every month. It’s increasing the supply of it. In fact, XRP over the past quarter has had a smaller supply increase % than ETH has.

Also ripple owning the majority of it means they are genuinely invested and interested in the success of XRP more so than anyone else. When XRP goes down, they lose more money than anyone else.. you could also say the same about the 2-3 BTC whales in China that control most of the mining and own most of the supply. So what is the difference there, except that the Chinese whales are more likely to dump randomly?

You asked Why would a big bank buy off of an exchange when they can buy directly from Ripple? Simple, if ripple directs them to the exchange. Look at what they just did this month, they released 1B from escrow then immediately locked it all back up in escrow. That could mean they are refusing to sell at this price, or they are directing buyers to the exchanges, or they are listening to the community and cutting back on sales.

So I answered your questions, hopefully you can respond to answers and tell me where I’m wrong."
128,DeFi - Decentralized finance.... you absolute spastic.
129,"But in the future this argument weakens as other coins begin to get more real world use, it’s abesoutely the weakest argument, and is reflected by the price"
130,"Honestly I havn't met anyone in real life who's into crypto's at all. Or at least it hasn't come up. The only conversations I've had about it with people I know have been on facebook, and even of those interested, very few even know what Bitcoin is, let alone XRP or ETH."
131,I do 🤷🏿‍♂️
132,Ripple could dump all their coins with one click. Can't mine all Eth/BTC in a month
133,"There absolutely is a huge difference.  Anyone can mine the BTC or ETH, yes most is mined in china currently, but that isn't necessarily true for the future, and at least even in that way it's still being spread out somewhat.

Whoopidy doo! They relocked up some of their supply.  Do you think it's cause they wanted to pretend there's less supply out there, or do you think it's cause their projections show they had no potential buyers? I'll make it easy and just answer.  They're a business.  They're there to make money.  They 100% did it because they currently have no buyers, not as some good faith show to their beloved community.  Also why would ripple direct them to an exchange?  Again they're a business first not some good will group of altruists.  The mental gymnastics you're doing is astonishing."
134,Don’t you think that being the first crypto to be used at scale by financial institutions is important in gaining traction? Do you see any other coins with the same institutional force that xrp does?
135,No other coin is doing what XRP is doing. They are replacing the SWIFT system. I could care less about decentralization...
136,"1) the whales can do that too. I just said that there are like 2 whales that control most of BTC, they can dump with one click too. So what’s the difference? A Chinese whale is also MORE likely to dump randomly. 

2) why would ripple do that? As I said they are obviously very interested in the success of Xrp.

3) they CANNOT dump all the xrp in escrow in one click. That’s absolute bullshit. It’s cryptographically locked up, they can only access it as per the contract, 1B per month. They can only dump what the individuals hold, so whatever Brad owns personally he can dump if he chooses, etc. the escrow will never be an issue. It’s just disbursing the supply out at nearly the same rate that BTCs supply is disbursed by mining"
137,"I’m the one doing the mental gymnastics? I just said in my original post that people will hate on ripple if they dump, or hate if they don’t dump, which is exactly what you are doing. You really think that ripple who’s usage has only been getting higher and higher, has had their first month with no buyers? They have shown that they listen to the community. They said in their last quarter report that they are cutting back on the sales, of which is what they have been doing. 

You keep forgetting one important thing: ripple cares about the success of XRP, and the XRP holders are a BIG factor in the success of XRP. If we all fuck off, then the price tanks, and that’s harder for ripple to explain to current clients who bought at a higher price, and harder to explain to future clients who see the investments fall. 

Everything I said is valid, you don’t seem to have any valid rebuttals to it. The whales potential to dump BTC is just as brutal as ripples potential to dump XRP, except one is more likely than the other, because one is interested in the success of their product and one is held accountable for it. The anonymous whales can fuck off and never need to say a word or answer to anything. You seemed to focus in on the “it will spread out from China”, that’s not the point. The point is that like 2-3 PEOPLE HAVE THE MAJORITY OF THE SUPPLY. What will you say when ripples ownership of XRP is under 50%, then they don’t own the majority of the supply anymore, then you will just find something else to talk shit about. You talking shit about them deciding not to sell is proof of just that. You will hate on them no matter what they do.

Also, there seems to be a misconception about the xrp in escrow. they CANNOT dump all the xrp in escrow. That’s absolute bullshit. It’s cryptographically locked up, they can only access it as per the contract, 1B per month,, and every month we see what they do with it, if it is sold or if it is moved back to escrow. They can only dump what the individuals hold, so whatever Brad owns personally he can dump if he chooses, etc. the escrow will never be an issue. Escrow is just disbursing the supply out at nearly the same rate that BTCs supply is disbursed by mining."
138,"Traction for the concept ? Sure. To address the latter part of your response, that is my exact point.. not right now, but what’s that worth, we are in pre model T era"
139,"Yes I understand ripple cares about ripple's success.  XRP individual holders are not a big factor to the success you're a stopgap.  If you were a factor they would build all their marketing towards you.  They're marketing and selling to banks, and it's naive to think otherwise.  I get it though, you're emotional about this (as is most of the ripple cult), and that's why you're passionate that everything you said is valid and mine isn't.  Ripple is your pick so you want it to succeed and the value to go to $10 each or something insane to believe will ever happen.

 >They said in their last quarter report that they are cutting back on the sales, of which is what they have been doing.

Seriously!?!? Think about what you said.  If they're concerned about Ripple's success then they should be selling all the time to anyone that will buy it.  Why would you invest in a company not doing that? Would you invest in McDonalds if they went to their shareholders and said ""Hey guys we're selling too many burgers so we're going to pull them off the menu for a month.""?  Does that sound more likely, or is it they currently don't have any prospects and aren't getting the meetings they once were during the boom?  There's other things at play than them just not selling any for a month to help you individual holders.  Again, don't be that naive.

No shit they can't dump all their xrp in escrow all at once.  No one has that misconception.  That's such a weird trick they pulled on ripple fans.  They pretend to have less supply cause they can only access 1BN a month?!  What's the point?  Other than I guess it works on some people.  There's currently more supply than there is demand or they wouldn't be locking the 1BN back up hoping for brighter days later.  Anyway it's pointless to argue with someone that's emotional about it so good luck to you in the future.  Ripple going after banks may be the right play and they might win out.  I hope not though cause that just sucks and is more of the same that we have today."
140,I completely agree that we are in the very earliest stages. But Ford has been one of the biggest automotive companies in the world for about 100 years... so if xrp is analogous to that product then there is no reason to be dismissive of its progress (and it should also be clear that in no way is price reflective of prospective use)
141,"To be fair, Ripple is also investing in things like Coil, which are predominately aimed at online communities and such. Also marketplaces, video streaming services, and gaming. Just because you don't actively follow developments doesn't mean it's not taking place. Wall street isnt their only goal."
142,"I said we are in ore model t era, It’s like your alliance to your position takes precedent over your close reading of my argument. If anything btc is the model t"
143,"Good for them.  I assume cause bank adoption isn't going as planned, but whatever way we get there."
144,"Bitcoin is analogous to model t if you go back to 2014. But there are many cryptos that have surpassed bitcoin technologically, including XRP. So if we are still in the pre-model t era like you stated, bitcoin will surely not be the model t."
145,"You must have missed the constant onboarding of partners, including those using ODL, and the massive increasing in XRP volume leading it to now account for the majority of ALL crypto transactions?"
146,"Decentralized finance will boost it’s adoption once we can cut expenses, such as gas fees."
147,"there is always risk with smart contracts and code immutability, take this into consideration"
148,"So much bullshit in one article could power a small city for years.

If people weren’t so blind  the story would be about how binance was being investigated for fraud just like most prominent figures of the crypto world should be."
149,So many haters.   I understand some people don’t like binance but it’s like people hating on anyone being successful.  You can’t deny they are building like crazy.  I’m neutral.
150,"So true.

There is enough bullshit in this article to make Bitcoin go to the moon."
151,"Haters? Lol no. It’s not just binance.

Almost all the so called founders and influencers and creators of coins and exchanges have traded infos,  defrauded or otherwise outright lied and stole in the background and took advantage of their followers one way or the other.

Very few exceptions exist and if people think these people give two fucks about any ideals people might have or entertain then they are about to have a very unpleasant surprise."
152,"Kraken.

Look up the epicenter podcast interview with their founder and CEO Jesse Powell.

They appear to be a pretty honestly run firm with a focus on security and privacy of their users, and specifically only make money off of their users through transaction fees. That’s it, no collecting or selling user data.

Furthermore I think their approach to the crypto space is fairly enlightened. They understand the raw implications behind blockchain, cryptocurrency technology and the potential change it can bring to the world- in other words they were founded on solid principles of advancing the industry for the benefit of consumers. 


Additionally they do a fair bit of research before listing any additional coins. Everything offered on the exchange has an interesting exciting or advancement capability behind it, or they wouldn’t list it.


Just my two cents! Listen to that interview for more insight"
153,"Integrate CoinZoom, with 40+ assets and VISA crypto cards it's going to be the next big thing, at least in the US"
154,"ecxx is a good exchange to consider, they have decent volume and are located in Singapore"
155,"Thank you for the insight, to be honest we were considering Kraken even before this ""poll"".

I also got a couple of inbox messages regarding Kraken, and I just listened to the podcast with Jesse Powell!

Again, a really helpful comment, thank you Asghoig!"
156,"Let me take a look at it, thanks Dredd!"
157,40+ assets? really? that's huge
158,Thanks! But it looks like it's a new exchange (not on coinmarketcap) - is there an API for it?
159,"PoS will be big in 2020, too bad they overlook IOST who are far ahead with their PoB consensus mechanism and their staking programm..

160,We need a trustless privacy solution
161,Most people who work in restaurants eat somewhere else for lunch.
162,who are we going to trust then?
163,If only there was something!!
164,"This looks like a good start:

This might prove to be a good solution too, but it's too soon to tell: https://hackernoon.com/stegos-more-trustless-than-zcash-more-scalable-than-monero-more-user-friendly-than-mimblewimble-c25ec11307e2"
165,">e a good

privacy coins???"
166,"Zcash is doing great things with snarks.

Stegos looks interesting as well but it seems mostly geared for transactional privacy, I'll have to look more into it

My favorite project right now is Enigma. They are doing general computations on encrypted data. So the data can be computed and used but it remains encrypted the entire time. Even the nodes doing the computations do not have access to the data.

167,Thank you!
