49,"Your entire post is on hype and not necessarily separate individual points. Though I largely agree with what you say, wouldn't you agree that exchanges are an easier marketplace? Laissez faire to ensure the right projects are picked up, but I do share your concerns with the ones promoted right now."
50,"Yes, regulations are voluntary and self-imposed, but after all, transparency should be a concern for investors in IEOS."
51,If the exchanges were transparent and provided all the information necessary for market participants to make Informed investment decisions we would have absolutely nothing to complain about.
52,Probably another scam tbh
53,Scam coin

57,"Did some research on Lightstream, there has been numerous platforms that targets file sharing but haven't seen one that's as precise as this. I bet this would be a great investment knowing that there would be real target market- musicians and artists who wants to veer away from other file sharing sites where contents are vulnerable to copyright infringement. Good luck to the team!"
58,Currently hesitating about this project. Please have a more detailed roadmap in your website plus put it in your white paper so you can plot detailed information about it! I don't know if this project is a scam..
59,Yeah fuck article 13 and its copyright infringement law.
