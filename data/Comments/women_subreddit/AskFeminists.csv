It also explains why Time’s Up didn’t get involved, which is simply that what she wanted was not the kind of service they provide (meaning she didn’t want to sue Biden)."
1,"The left, and democrats in general, while they can be the lesser evil, aren’t great either. It’s not reported on because they can’t use it to push their agenda. 

Almost every single feminist I’m close friends with, or around in general, are outraged by it as well. But mind you, although some might vote Democrat in order to help things get better, most still don’t consider themselves democrats.

Even if Biden won at this point, it would just be replacing one rapist for another."
2,"There are a lot of reasons why this story hasn't gained traction in the mainstream. One is that covid has completely overwhelmed the entirety of the news' attention. Another is that the podcast host who shared Reade's story did not do the appropriate journalism to verify all verifiable claims she made.  [This article](https://jezebel.com/tara-reades-allegations-deserve-more-care-1842515308) from Jezebel does a good job explaining how Halper did Reade a disservice and failed to follow modern journalistic standards for sexual assault claims. Reade's claim deserves to be taken seriously, and it has not been by the mainstream or by those who published her claim blindly."

4,"Why?

> various right-wing websites that immediately jumped on this story while ignoring and excusing the countless accusations against Trump. 

This is why. Because American politics is pick-a-side and to many people poor behaviour on their own side i;s acceptable to ignore if not ignoring it means their side has less chance of winning"

6,"Times up specifically silenced the victim in this case because ""they didn't want to lose their non-profit status"" (which is bullshit.)


As for the rest... Idk I'm with you. Fuck the media."
7,"This seems like an excellent piece. A bit of tl;dr:

>  
>\[...\] It's not just about fairness to the accused, but also to the accusers. Women who tell these stories inevitably get blasted by skeptics who pick their stories apart, so it's critical to their safety that the reporting holds up under close scrutiny. That's only going to be more true when the story has major political implications or confusing twists that could be interpreted as red flags — or both, like this one does.

>In light of these details, Salon concludes that mainstream outlets who are being criticized for not writing about Reade's allegations probably aren't making that choice because they're covering up for Joe Biden. What's more likely driving the silence — so far — is a genuine reluctance to dive into a story that contains such a high number of complicating factors and proves difficult to pin down, especially with the coronavirus emergency dominating the news cycle.

Clearly written, well organized. Thanks for the link"
8,"I think MeToo is only silent about this because the alternative is Trump. Their strategy is basically ""let's go with the guy who assaulted two women instead of the guy who assaulted like 20 or 30."""

10,ShoeOnHead?  Really?
11,"Thanks for pulling the TL;DR!

I was wondering about the same thing as OP yesterday and was happy to see this published on the same day."
12,"MeToo is a hashtag, not an organization.

Let me specify that better...

MeToo is the talking point of people who have come together to raise awareness about the sexual assault that women face, not an organization which makes general statements about current affairs."
13,"Bernie still technically has a chance, but their is no way the free delegates are going to choose him."
14,"I know that, I'm just saying that people are choosing a lesser evil in this case. When I say ""MeToo"" I mean people who are vocal on social media about sexual assault."
15,The superdelegates only vote if there’s no majority on the first round at the convention. That’s a change from 2016.
16,"In theory, if enough people created a movement, raised hell and disgraced Biden enough to step down, would that help Bernie's chances? I mean as it stands I don't see the willpower of the people to make it happen, unfortunately."
17,"Okay, that makes sense. Some people think it’s like, an organization that puts out statements, so I just wanted to make that clear just in case.

I honestly am not on Twitter, but I did look up the hashtag, [it is being talked about](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MeToo&src=typed_query), it’s just not being reported that it’s being talked about."
18,"Biden doesn't have a majority though, he has a plurality."

20,"Yeah, honestly it's journalistic malpractice that no major media outlet is covering it."
21,"Well yeah, it’s early April. I’m just noting that this isn’t a situation where the superdelegates could actually override a delegate majority."
22,"100% agree with you. Most mainstream journalism has turned to a stance, and are biased about their reporting. Feminists hate this. Especially when they use things like feminism to push their agenda, but only when it matters to them. Otherwise, they don’t give a fuck about women either, let’s be honest."
23,"Can you explain, in your own words, the origin and practice of both?"
24,"I do not support the Deluth model which is silent on female abusers and places too much abuse on gender roles. While physical violence and rape are mostly perpetrated by men, all genders abuse."

26,"It’s not a term I use much, and I think intersectionality does a better job explaining the dynamics of multiple power structures operating at once, but I don’t take issue with people who use it in most cases.  

The only issue I have ever had is people who refuse to discuss patriarchy because ‘actually, it’s a kyriarchy.’  That’s a problem with those people though and not really a problem unique to that term."
27,"I like both terms.  The patriarchy would, I think, be considered part of a kyriarchy, so sometimes you want to talk specifically and sometimes you'd just be more general.  There are some differences in how feminism affects women of different races (disclaimer; I am a woman of colour, but I generally pass for white, so my personal experiences are within that sphere).  For example, I read an interesting article by a black woman who felt that, as a black woman, she wanted to wear a wedding ring, be called Mrs, take her husbands name, be given away by her father, etc, and engage with all this tradition because of the stereotype of black absent fathers and single mothers, even though, as a feminist, she felt these traditions were outdated.  There are some parts of feminist history which, unfortunately, did exclude women of colour or ignored their needs, and it's useful to have some words and models to talk about it."
28,"I don’t think there’s an issue with either term, I’d honestly use both. The patriarchy is apart of the kyriarchy, just as feminism is apart of equalitarianism."
29,"I don't see why you can't use Mike Tyson's fitness routine or admire his boxing skills while still acknowledging that he is an probably a rapist. 

However, are you increasing his wealth by following his routine? That's where I might draw the line. I wouldn't want to intentionally support someone gaining wealth, power, or fame, by patronizing their work."
30,"It's okay and reasonable to admire something about a person and also dislike something else about them. A classic example is the music of Richard Wagner. Great music. Guy was a Nazi sympathizer. It's still reasonable and okay to enjoy his music. His Nazi sympathies are not important to the creation of the work.

Similarly, it is okay to admire the skill of the boxers you mention. What would be wrong is to take that admiration of skill and use it to decide every other part of their personality is also good and admirable.

So long as you continue to oppose their choices, you can still use the skills that are independent of those choices.

On a more practical level, it'd be a good idea to find a role model who isn't a piece of shit, because the kind of complex understanding I laid out above isn't easy. But it is okay, if you can do it."
31,"As long as they don't profit from anything, study their craft to become the best you can be. One day you may be the role model you wished you had."
32,"One of my favorite authors, H.P. Lovecraft was extra racist, even for living in a time where the standard was pretty racist - I appreciate his work and what he contributed to literature and horror, but the guy himself gets no praise from me outside that. It's a similar boat - I feel conflicted about it and mirroring/emulating/adapting his horror in my own work can feel a bit gross at times because it -is- associated with him and his work itself would sometimes evoke his racism and classism - things I find abhorrent.  


I think as long as you focus on the things they've contributed to the sport - training/diet regimens, how they fought, etc...and don't let that turn into hero worship/ignoring the things they themselves have done, you're good. Like if a regimen is good/effective, that's just an objective fact - no reason to hamstring yourself by avoiding sound advice/evidence."
33,"Uh, imma disagree with you on the specific example of Wagner. First, you can’t really call him a Nazi sympathizer, because he died in 1883. However, he was certainly a raging anti-Semite, and some of his operas contain very deliberately unflattering portrayals of Jewish characters. Enjoying Wagner’s music is not, to my mind, the same sort of “take the good parts and leave the rest” that we might argue could be said of so many other composers whose now-problematic elements seem to be unthinking or latent effects of the culture in which they lived. Wagner was deliberate. His anti-Semitism *is* important to the creation of his work. Pretty much every piece of music Wagner wrote he intended to be a moral lesson, and those moral lessons explicitly included anti-Semitism. 

So for me, while I can appreciate his *craft* (although frankly, I don’t actually appreciate it all that much), that’s very different from saying “oh, yeah, it’s totally ok to be a Wagner fan because it doesn’t really matter that he was an anti-Semite.” I would regard anyone who in the modern day describes themselves as a “Wagner fanboy” (or fangirl, whatever) with the same kind of raised eyebrow I give to alt-righters."
34,Thank you. Now I wonder whose story I got him confused with!
35,"You're equating heterosexual sexual desire with objectification, which isn't actually a given. 

It's true that many heterosexual men have embraced the idea that women are objects designed for their sexual gratification instead of seeing us as, say, fellow human beings with whom they might share a mutually pleasurable and transcendent experience, for instance. But I don't think the sexual objectification of women is a necessary requirement of heterosexual maleness, or heterosexuality more generally. It's a cultural mindset that I'm hopeful we can collectively unlearn.

Why do you think all straight men think about women in reprehensible ways? Do you think about other men in reprehensible ways? Is the problem you see sexuality in general, or about women's bodies in particular? Do you imagine that lesbians, bi- and pansexual women think about women in reprehensible ways as well, given that they also experience sexual desire for women? 

Are you starting from the assumption that sex with women is necessarily reprehensible for some reason? At the core, you may be conceptualizing women as de facto sex objects, and extrapolating a judgment from there about heterosexual men and their desires for those objects, without stopping to interrogate that initial misogynist perception."
36,"> Something about the way desire for the female body from the perspective of the man, and the sexualization and objectification that implies, seems to disqualify any man from being a feminist in my mind. 

One, obviously, desire does not equal objectification.  
Secondly, does that mean gay women cannot be feminists?

My partner is feminist, and among the many things I've learned from her, is that straight men would be better served being feminist allies rather than feminists, strictly speaking. I'm both, technically, but if I was in a room with female feminists, I'm going to generally defer to them on topics regarding feminism (unless they need/want a male perspective).

&#x200B;

> Honestly, what I’m really trying to figure out is if this idea reflects more on straight men or if it reflects some internalized sexism on my part. 

Hammer, meet nail head."
37,"I am a straight male feminist. Simply, feminism is the recognition that women are oppressed in society and that needs to be fixed. It's not going against men. Male feminism is just empathy.

We are absolutely **not** going against the male gender. Those shitebags that say otherwise are not feminists, just nutters. What we are doing is recognizing the societal disadvantages of women and wanting to fix it. This is not going against all men. The system is *not* the fault of all men. Rather, we are going against those shitheads who think women don't deserve equal rights, pay, etc. This is **absolutely** not all men.

I hope that clears it up for you."
38,"I’m happy for men to call themselves feminists, however to me the important thing is how they take part in the movement. I think a man can be a feminist in his beliefs but a feminist ally in their actions, which makes sense in my head but might not on paper. 

For example, I try to act as an LGBTQ+ ally and an ally to POC, which to me means calling out discrimination when I see it, especially from fellow cis/straight and white people - but also means keeping my mouth shut and listening to the groups I am trying to advocate for. So I think a feminist man listens to women and learns from their told experiences and doesn’t insist on inserting himself into the discussion, which is ally behavior to me. Did I explain that a tiny bit? Lol. It’s too late to be trying to write deep thoughts."
39,"Simple response: Well, lesbians can be and are feminist.

I see where you're coming from though. I too have found that most straight men who identify as feminist don't do *nearly* enough to challenge their own unconscious biases and deeply ingrained misogynistic socialization. But to a lesser extent, that could be said for people of any gender or orientation. So I don't think it *inherently* has anything to do with attraction to women--perhaps indirectly as function of their participation in (and benefit from) heteronormative patriarchy.

Ultimately, I don't see a point in policing who can and can't call themselves feminist--it seems like a unproductive battle to choose. When straight men self-identify that way, though, I do take it with a hefty grain of salt--just not for the exact reasons you identify."
40,"So because I find women attractive, I can't want women to have the same legal rights as me, a man? Your argument holds no merit at all. You confuse desire with objectification and reduce all men to perpetrators due to their innately biologically driven desires.

I could, using your logic, argue that because you don't even find women attractive, how could you care about their liberation? This would be absurd also, freedom and sexual desire are separate areas which can overlap."
41,"As far as I'm concerned cis men can be allies but not feminists - on the basis that feminism is a movement by and for women, it's women led.

It's similar to being a trans ally, gay ally, ally to POC, etc. - if you're not a member of X minority then it's not your fight or your movement to be part of. You cannot know the nuances of how prejudice impacts on their lives or know what is best for them. You support, listen, learn, and allow them to lead. 

There is something to your post...not straight-phobia, no such thing, but you seem to make a link with the idea of straight men being attracted to women as being inherently bad, sexualisation or objectification. I'd guess maybe you were influenced by toxic masculinity growing up."
42,"I think the idea that straight men are inherently not feminist is a pretty bleak outlook on sexuality. Sure, a lot aren't - maybe most aren't - but I think one of the main points of feminism is being able to envision alternatives to current patriarchal norms, including in intimate relationships."
43,"That’s definitely something I’ve been thinking about—whether this is really just internalized misogyny. I guess it’s certainly possible. I think maybe what’s behind this feeling is preconceived notions about how straight sex works (having no experience with it myself)—with the man as dominant and the woman as submissive—and therefore concluding that it is, as an act, inherently denigrating to the woman. I also think some anger toward straight men and how they aren’t forced to confront their toxic masculinity in the way gay men are is also a contributing factor.

And to answer your other question, no I don’t feel the same way about women who are attracted to other women because in my mind in that relationship, while it may have dominant and submissive roles, there isn’t a man—there isn’t a privileged party asserting dominance. I guess the same goes for dominant/submissive gay male relationships, because both are equally privileged as men. 

So I guess it’s partially a misconception of heterosexual sex on my part, and I need to remind myself that heterosexual sex can exist without a power imbalance. I guess my concern then comes from not knowing if a man does in fact think about women as objects. Because obviously historically many men have, and while I guess there are many men out there who don’t, I, as a gay man who is naturally suspicious of straight men, always wonder, what if they do? And if they do, how can they call themselves feminists?"
44,"Point definitely taken—and re lesbians being feminist, I don’t think about them in the same way that I do men, and of course they can be feminists. 

It’s interesting that you mention how straight men benefit from patriarchy though, because I’ve always wondered to what degree someone who benefits from an oppression can ever truly oppose it. Like maybe they say that they do, or even they’ve convinced themselves that they do, but deep down can they ever really be in opposition to it? It feels like there must be some unconscious urge saying “no, I want to be on top”. I don’t know. I could be entirely wrong. But it is something I wonder about."
45,">As far as I'm concerned cis men can be allies but not feminists - on the basis that feminism is a movement by and for women, it's women led.

For the most part, I agree. However, I would call myself (man) a feminist in that it drives many of my behavioural decisions. I would call myself an ally when discussing feminist issues with others."
46,"The difference I personally find is that like... Not every women is a feminist, not every black person is part of BLM - so while you can only be an ally to PoC or LGBT+ while not being in those groups yourself, I think for groups that are defined by their beliefs instead of their experiences, there may be some room for differing experiences. But I'm white so I don't get to speak for who gets to be in BLM."
47,"Feminism is a political movement, you’re not some minority like POC or gay people. So comparing those is just straight up stupid. Just like white people can be apart of BLM, men can be feminists. Wtf."
48,"I keep around a handy-dandy list of what constitutes objectification. Finding someone sexy isn't on it:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/96sc20/sexual_objectification_of_women_in_ads_revealing/e42xf6x/

> I think maybe what’s behind this feeling is preconceived notions about how straight sex works (having no experience with it myself)—with the man as dominant and the woman as submissive

In fact, that is not inherent to straight sex. 

>  I, as a gay man who is naturally suspicious of straight men, always wonder, what if they do? And if they do, how can they call themselves feminists?

Generally speaking, the men who objectify women also don't call themselves feminists. A feminist view point is a pretty good (though not fail-safe) way of identifying straight men who don't embrace toxic masculinity."
49,"I suspect what you're doing here is equating a penis penetrating a vagina as the power move that women cannot get out from under, as it were. That being penetrated is inherently a powerless position, therefore men who want to penetrate women are always powerful and women are always powerless, and that's how they like it, which is indeed pretty gross.

The primacy of male sexuality within heterosexual discourse and practice is *overwhelming* and really hard to watch from the sidelines (as a lesbian I am also on the sidelines of this conversation, for what it's worth). There is a lot of criticism to launch at all that, but the problem isn't not about specific sexual practices like penetration of a vagina with a penis. Penetration as a sex act isn't the power problem.  Men who use their own pleasure as the yardstick and don't care enough about female pleasure because they consider it secondary or subsidiary to their own, or who think female pleasure is just too complicated and not worth the effort, are deffo a massive, massive problem that heterosexuality needs to contend with. But that doesn't seem to be what you're getting at.

I appreciate that you're approaching this from a supportive perspective, but launching heterosexual women de facto into the powerless category because they  have a vagina that might be penetrated by a man is simply reifying misogynist beliefs about the ""natural"" lesser place of women. There's nothing inherently powerless about being penetrated. You could use the same logic to say that antelopes are in the power position vis a vis lions because the lions have to eat them, not the other way around."
50,"I certainly agree with you on that point. It's what lesbian feminists have been saying for a very long time--that heterosexuality and patriarchy are deeply intertwined and that one cannot be dismantled without the other. But this affects both men *and* women. The unfortunate reality is that most straight women find that the sacrifice is too great to seriously buck against patriarchy. I mean, I've never seen a lesbian woman tolerate toxic behavior from men--why would they? And yet it's quite typical for straight women, often perceived as a necessity. When I ask my straight friends why they condone toxic/abusive/misogynistic behavior from male partners, the answer is always some form of ""Well, there is no such thing as a perfectly non-sexist man, so I need to have realistic expectations if I want to have a boyfriend/husband."" Yikes.

But given that heterosexuality realistically isn't going away any time soon, I think we simply *have to* believe there are incremental steps we can take toward slowly eroding patriarchy over time. Perhaps straight men can never truly be against a system that benefits them, but if they can be reformed in small ways, that's...progress. And it's probably the best we can hope for."
51,"I mean if you ask a lot of modern day feminists they will assert that patriarchy hurts men as well. Objectively if you are part of a system that limits the opportunities of or undervalues half of its population you are not necessarily having the best people in charge and the best minds pushing society forward. Would you rather be in control even if it means things are shittier or would you rather the best and brightest be allowed to shine and enlighten humanity regardless of gender? I guess patriarchy dies when newer generations of men get tired of things being fucked up, or when we rise up and eat the rich, lol."
52,"Feminism is a social movement, and women are a minority...thus why we have feminism. It's absolutely not okay for men to be taking up space in womens movements, shaping or leading a movement for women."
53,"I think what worked for Neanderthals 40,000 years ago has little relevance on today."
54,"My opinion (without knowing too much about how conclusive these studies are):

Just because it may have been helpful for early homo sapiens to have roles divided up according to sex (I don’t think it’s possible to conclusively say they had ‘gender’ as we understand it at this point), that doesn’t mean it’s helpful now

The world today is vastly different, and we don’t benefit from differentiating between these roles now"
55,"I have some questions about what archaeological evidence this is based on. We of course have some neanderthal artifacts and art but I'm not entirely sure there'd be any way for us to use the archaeological record to definitively say who was using which tools or doing certain activities-- and that gets my skepticism up quite quickly that this is just some arm-chair anthropology that conveniently relies upon something modern humans practice (traditional gender labor division) and is applying it onto the past to suggest it's good, right, or natural-- which, FYI, isn't actually science even if a scientific journal published it.

Edited to add: additionally and perhaps tellingly, this is a link to a press release and not an actual study, and the press release itself doesn't the link the study, which is both conspicuous *and* unusual."
56,"The supposition is incorrect. First off, Neanderthals were already on their way out. Second, homo sapiens did well because of social organization, not gendered labor roles. **Some ""researchers"" have assumed social organization means gendered labor roles - but they have zero evidence for this.** In fact, we have some evidence to the contrary (the style of hunting was communal and relied on numbers, therefore not having women hunt would have hurt the meat-gathering ability of a group).

So your underlying premise - that there was gendered division of labor before the advent of farming and/or the bow & arrow - is probably false.

/u/nervaonside
/u/wormbreath
/u/avocado-nightmare"
57,"There is plenty of evidence that homo sapiens didn't beat out the neanderthals at all. Nor did they necessarily out-think or out-compete any other ancient human population, like homo erectus, homo rhodesiensis, the Denisovans, and all the other members of human family that we discover in the fossil record or in DNA. It's seems increasingly more likely that migrating populations simply loved all these other groups of humans to extinction.  We are not just homo sapiens, after all. We are the offspring of all of these groups. We've benefited from that blending, and the offspring of both groups reproduced in larger numbers than the parent groups could.

Modern humans are a mix, there's no getting around that. We interbred with our cousins in Africa, and in the middle east, in India and in Asia, and in Europe: hybrid populations are all that's left, so presumably hybrid populations survive climate change better than non-hybrid populations. We didn't beat them, we are them.

I'm not sure any economic theory can rival the power of love, man."
58,Current understanding of historical evidence doesn't support this so my opinion is that this theory is ignorant
59,What if people used this same argument every time feminists say that hunters and gatherers used to be more egalitarian?
60,"> The world today is vastly different, and we don’t benefit from differentiating between these roles now

One might point out that almost all of the countries that have gotten rid of these gender segregated divisions of labor have a birth rate below replacement level.

So it's still up for debate rather no gender divisions of labor is sustainable in the long run."
61,"From the study itself, the section on the archaeological evidence and probably the most telling overall:

Re: available evidence for what neanderthals were eating and if they had gender-segregated diets ""Admittedly, however, the human fossil sample is currently too small to permit detection of possible differences between males and females""

Basically the whole study is a lot of speculation and story-telling based on some very limited evidence. It relies too heavily on gaps in the archaeological record (basically there isn't enough specific evidence that neanderthal women were doing enough ""women's"" work like sewing and vegetable processing, so the authors assume that there wasn't any gendered labor division.

There are a number of issues with the conclusions drawn here.

1. the climate and environment during the time period they are examining neanderthal behavior were quite different than the climate and environment where Homo Sapiens evolved before they migrated out of Africa
2. Broadly speaking neanderthals were less technologically advanced than homo sapiens; bench-marking gendered labor division with the stipulation that neanderthal women would be using similar or even the same types of tools that early homo sapiens women used is thus a pretty strange metric-- especially considering that technological innovation is what distinguishes the two groups the most. If neanderthals (men or women) had been innovating technology the same way that homo sapiens was, they wouldn't be extinct today.
3. As a result, the tie-back to *gendered* labor in particular (and thus your assertion that perhaps modernly losing gendered labor division will be Bad Evolutionary) is tenuous, at best-- at worst, it's hokey arm-chair ""evolutionary psychology"".
4. Anthropology has had a lot of sexism issues, just, all throughout, and I'm not seeing anything in this study that suggests this isn't coming from a pretty status-quo place when it comes to applying modern biases about gendered behavior onto the past.\*"
62,"It's a non-sequitur. It may be true, but it doesn't have any bearing on how society works today."
63,"They were not more egalitarian. Some hunter-gatherer societies were more egalitarian and some were very not egalitarian, but the same can be said about agriculturalist societies. The idea that society was marvellous till the neolithic revolution came along is a modern version of the Noble Savage trope, and it needs to die.

Anyway, nobody is arguing that society ought to be more egalitarian because it was more egalitarian in the past."
64,"Providing women with more education, personal financial freedom, and bodily autonomy can contribute to a lower birth rate - but I fail to see how that’s a bad thing? That means less children born into poverty and less burden to our planet."
65,"You're presuming that constant expansion of the population is a sign of *sustainability,* which is odd. The opposite is clearly true.

The most successful human population ever was homo erectus, who settled a wide swath of the earth, and survived for over a million years. We are not close to that record. The most successful modern human populations, if long term sustainability is the measure, are the indigenous peoples of Australia, who have sustained a shared culture for over 60K years. Only intensive agricultural societies require so much cheap labour that they need ever-expanding birth rates, and intensive agricultural societies have yet to prove that they can make it past the 6K mark. By definition, constant growth in any population is unsustainable, and we are facing that problem right now. So you may want to rethink your metrics."
66,"A) a birth rate below replacement level is not by definition a bad thing, and may be exactly what our species needs right now to survive

B) a quick scan of Wikipedia will show you that there are numerous other factors that potentially contribute to countries having birth rates below replacement level"
67,"Men absolutely can be feminists.  We have a number of men here who are feminists.  Some men prefer to call themselves as allies and don’t take on the label of feminist personally and that is fine too.  Your sister is a incorrect/misinformed on this one.

Yeah, you don’t want to appropriate the movement but a man who is a feminist is not inherently doing that."
68,"Feminism needs men. I frankly don’t care what they call themselves. I’m more interested in what they say to their friends who do shitty catcalling or say inappropriate, gross things about women or a guy they see on the street with painted nails or any shit like that. Arguing over labels is just not worth the time."
69,"The term ""ally"" initially comes from the straight ally in LGBT movements, right? It makes sense in that context because there is no term for a position that fights on behalf of LGBT rights; there is no word with an -ism suffix, so you're either LGBT+ or you're an ally. But feminism is specifically that word itself in our context. If the term didn't exist, and all we had was something like women's rights movement, then ally would suit more."
70,"Might be a bit biased here, what with being a male feminist and all, but I think it's important for men to do more than just support the movement - we need to be a part of it - organizing, working to accomplish the goals of feminism, etc...  
That said, it's absolutely imperative that, when discussing issues that primarily affect women, we need to make sure women are centered in those conversations.  
Thing is, as long as misogyny continues to be prevalent throughout society, there are going to be people who fail to listen when women are talking - but they'll listen when a man is. I've seen this first hand working in violence prevention - some of the students we see don't respond to my female colleagues the same way they respond to me. Hate that it is that way, but we've got to recognize that is the reality of the situation.  


Also, like I commented on another's thread here - the alternative 'egalitarian' carries too much baggage in online spaces, since it's often evoked solely to shut down discussions of feminism, for me to really want to use that as a label - and I don't have an issue with taking on a label that centers women's issues over my own because I recognize the privilege being AMAB has given me.  


I know this isn't something that's universally agreed on by feminists, though. My experience is that it's been more in this direction than not, but I don't think we have any large-scale surveys on the matter."
71,"I am a male feminist. Maybe it's because my parents were feminists, but I very quickly understood the cause from a young age. 

Feminism is simply the *recognition* that women are oppressed by society and that needs to be fixed. That's the main message. There is nothing there that stops men from recognising that women are oppressed and this is unfair. That is just empathy. Explain to your sister what feminism *actually* is."
72,A feminist is anyone who believes in gender equality regardless of gender.
73,"Feminism is about gender quality, politically socially and economically. While it is called feminism because the movement was started by women, and women are still the forefront of the movement due to there still being inequality in many areas where a woman is seen as inferior, men can be feminists if the believe in gender equality. Feminism isn't just about women. You'd only be an ally if gender equality didn't affect you, when it does, men are not equal to women in many ways too, which feminists have been trying to address. You can also be a feminist if you support women's rights too. Feminism is about all genders. Of course men can be feminists."
74,"I don’t think men are explicitly excluded from being feminists. (what kind of feminist would I be to exclude someone on the basis of gender?)
That said, I prefer the term ally myself for men who recognize and push back against obstacles unique to women. I think men labeling themselves as feminists can trigger a knee-jerk reaction for me that can feel a bit like mansplaining and/or appropriating a movement.
I often wish there was a non-gendered term that was something along the lines of gender-role-abolitionist that felt more appropriate to me when applied to people of any gender.
After all, if we are fighting for equal pay for women, we also need to be fighting for expanded parental leave options for men. It’s all related."
75,"I think feminist is right for men because feminism is about dismantling patriarchy, and patriarchy is much more than gender inequality.  It's a social system organized on the values of militarism, violence, dominance, and hierarchy.  The first originating social hierarchy was men above women, which is why we call it patriarchy.  Lots of feminists believe the patriarchal social system is the root cause of many ills in the world that make up the rest of the kyriarchy, including racism and colonialism.

Think of all the weird results we would get if feminism = gender equality.  An equal number of women murderers?  Feminism!  Sexual assault of men by women is increasing?  Slay queen!  Women labor traffickers?  Girlboss shit!

Feminism is the right term because women started this movement and they've done ninety-five percent of the work to get us here.  Men would never have given a second thought to dismantling patriarchy on their own.  So any man joining the movement needs to be cognizant of that and not act like they own the place.  It's like if you're a bourgeoisie who wants to be a socialist, you don't come in and start lecturing working class people about the proper reading of Marx.  Yes socialism will benefit middle class people too, but you never would have started it and it didn't get this far because of you and your suffering.  Show some respect."
76,I’m not trying to be dense but what would be the functional difference between being an ally or being labeled a feminist be?
77,"I believe your sister is correct, and men should only call themselves allies."
78,"IMO they can only be allies, but this is an issue that feminists disagree on. I would also disagree with this ""feminism is for everyone"" rhetoric - feminism is for women, and letting men call themselves ""feminists"" gives their voices equal power in the movement (and honestly, more power, because even the ""feminist"" men I've known speak over women).

Look at how many men come here asking what feminism is doing about men's issues, or the necessity of a stickied thread on this sub about men's issues. There's no similar ""what are you doing about white people's issues?"" on /r/BlackLivesMatter, or a ""what are you doing for straight people"" on /r/lgbt .

Men do have their own gender-related issues, but they need to address those in their own movement, not by co-opting feminism."
79,Egalitarian?
80,"Why tho? To ""not appropiate the movement?"" Cmon. Men have issues too, issues due to the gender roles like toxic masculinity, higher suicide rates and higher work accidents. They should fight for those and when they do, they fight for equality. For feminism. Saying to them they cant be feminists only puts up barriers, barriers that we simply cant afford. Feminism stands for equality; its everyone or noone."
81,"I generally agree with what you've written, but I'd say: Men should only call themselves feminists if they are able to listen to women's perspectives and value them without automatically bringing up their own issues and perspectives. 

I've met men who are able to do that. 

But I agree that there are lots of ""feminist"" men who just... well... take the lable for some bullshit reason (""I'm feminist, I took my wife's name when we married, look what a wonderful man I am, it's so so special that I did this for my poor supressed wife... I'm the living symbol of equality, worship me and I will tell you, woman, what is important about your life..."" .*..sorry, just remembered a very annoying encounter with someone and needed to get some of it out...*)

What I wanted to say... they take the lable, feel good about it and think that's it, because they've done *good* and this will last till eternity. But those aren't allies either. They are part of the problem, often mansplaining feminism to women without listening to anything we have to say."
82,"Unfortunately, at least in American/European centric online spaces, 'egalitarian' has taken on some baggage. It's too often used by people trying to shut down feminists online - seen it plenty of times where the topic of feminism is brought up and some guy(or woman) chimes in with ""Oh, I'm an egalitarian because I want equality for EvErYoNe!"" - implying that isn't the goal of feminism, effectively strawmanning the feminist movement."
83,"Yes men have their own issues, but why do they need to be addressed by feminism in particular and not a separate men-focused movement? Women are constantly accommodating men's needs in our daily lives, do we really have to do it in feminism too?

Whites also have a higher suicide rate - do you expect a group like BLM to take that on, since they're focused on ""racial equality""? That sounds completely ridiculous, right? That's about how I feel about male suicide rates being a feminist issue."
84,Well in America and in Europe women habe already achieved equality legally.  So it makes sense to call the movement egalitarian from now on
85,"If we ignore the simple argument that ""it should be a movement for equality and justice"", there are two reasons that I've read. 

Intersectionality and the fact that men and women's issues are more often than not intertwined. For example, how are you going to end misogyny without addressing people telling boys to ""stop hitting/crying like a girl"", or have stop having men/boys look down on ""women's work"" if they are shamed/not allowed to work there? There are many more examples. In essence, you won't bring down any Patriarchy effectively, if ever, by ignoring/not addressing large chunks of it."
86,"Because the men focused movements that exist mainly dedicate to bring down women. Its not about accomodate  their needs, its about fighting for equality with all that it implies."
87,"Yeeeeah, nah.

Like I know where you're coming from - on paper you can't discriminate against women in XY&Z ways, but that doesn't mean it isn't still happening. It also doesn't mean that our culture has adjusted fully to that - we still have a culture that facilitates treating women as less-than - and the impact of this is evidenced in a number of ways.

This is -exactly- what I was talking about."
88,"It makes no sense whatsoever, even if it was true."
89,"I said legally.  That's the key word. If someone pays you or discriminates, you can take them to court. 
 
Men are also treated as less than women in many ways. Whether in divorce courts or in times of war or for parental rights. They are seen as pedophiles by default. You might say that feminism cares about these problems too but in reality they never have and never will."
90,"Right and just because legal protections are offered in name doesn't necessarily equate to those protections being able to be exercised freely, doesn't erase harm already done, etc...

No feminist is going to deny that men don't also have issues unique to them - the -only- stickied post in this sub is specifically a list of feminist resources for men's issues.

I don't think you're here in good faith, so I'm probably not going to engage further honestly."
91,"That's what I said, we have achieved legal equality. And since men and women have unique social problems, instead of calling it a feminism, it's better to find a gender neutral term like Egalitarianism. 

I would also add that in Islamic countries like pakistan or saudi arabia, feminist movement is extremely important(even though it's almost non existent in such countries )."
92,"The issue is doing that ignores/erases the reality that while we might legally, on paper have equality - we absolutely have not achieved it by an objective measure - trying to call it egalitarianism now would only serve to erase/cover up male privilege.

Which is why we shouldn't."
93,The problem here is that you will never be able to measure social equality objectively.
94,"I think maybe her point is if you can control reproductive power and sexual expression, you can control people. The first form of oppression known to man is patriarchy, which started out as men taking control of women's sexuality in order to keep his property within his bloodline. if you bring race into it, during slavery, slave owners raped their female (and often male) slaves, but also forced them to mate with each other to produce more slaves. but then  after slavery, white people degrade us by calling us overly sexual (our men are supposedly rapists  and predatory, which means they are to be feared and therefore need to be treated as criminals,  while our women have too much sex and too many babies, so we're welfare queens and  undeserving of compassion and humanity). every social minority has been degraded and dehumanized on the basis of their sexuality, which can then play a hand in other aspects of how we are viewed by oppressors. 

sorry for the messy analysis. Ill go into more detail about my opinion if you ask."
95,"Perhaps she is arguing that all systems of oppression and power inbalances will become sexualised and fetishized in a way that helps to enforce and justify the oppression.

The example that springs to mind would be the racial stereotypes common in porn, the insatiably sexual Black man with a large penis and a taste for white women or the submissive, passive and thin East Asian woman."
96,"I dunno, why don't you ask your [young, attractive female students you can't keep your grubby hands off of](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/d1ombl/pat_on_the_back_now_political/)?"

118,"I haven’t read the book, but I’m interested as to what ‘gender-bending’ activities for women are. I would say that loads of us dress ‘like a man’ in daily lives, if you are considering wearing trousers and suits as dressing like a man. Femininity needs effort to perform and when we don’t perform it we are sometimes said to be acting like men. 

Also when you say men transform on women, do you mean transform into women? As in referring to trans women?"
119,"Something I don’t get there is that even if lesbian relationships are more acceptable than gay ones (not sure I agree with you on that- there is a big difference between lesbians being fetishised and being accepted) then why would men feel like they have to ‘transform’ into women to have a relationship with women? Straight relationships are still more accepted than gay ones.

122,"I didn’t click on the link, but I’d be very surprised if that were true. (Edit, I did)

I absolutely think rape and abuse of men should be included in our fight toward equality. We aren’t equal if men aren’t equal, whether in or out of power.

Edit: these resources from the same study say otherwise:

123,"“Educate our children on consent”

That’s literally the solution that we talk about all the time. Teaching everyone consent from a young age, both how to know whether you have it and how to feel comfortable asserting your ability to withdraw it, is literally the only real solution to reducing the startling numbers of sexual assault for everyone. Teaching children that they can say no to a hug, no matter who it’s from, and asserting their right to not be touched if they don’t want to be, is a huge first step in this.

We also want to break down patriarchal bullshit that hinders everyone’s ability to feel like they can come forward and be believed and receive support. Right now, nobody is believed, for various sexist reasons, and none of it is helping anybody.

But it’s also disingenuous to pretend that women aren’t experiencing sexual violence and harassment at an alarming rate. Statistically, the number one perpetrator of violence against women is men. Men do experience violence, sexual and otherwise, but the majority of their perpetrators are not women. Which, unfortunately, means that the largest perpetrators of violence against *everyone* is men. So yes, “teach men not to rape” is still a perfectly valid perspective."
124,The very first article he cites outright contradicts his claims lmao.
125,"Haven’t looked into this guy’s info much, but male survivors of rape/sexual assault are people who don’t get nearly enough visibility, support or attention. They’re used as jokes, like the whole “don’t drop the soap” thing. The statistics I know is that 1/6 men are victims of sexual harassment/assault, and 1/3 women. 

That said, the way this person handled it was like a complete jackass. It wasn’t about presenting it as “see, men deal with it too, more than you think” it was “SEE it’s ACTUALLY a men’s issue, NOT a women’s issue.” 

Like fuck off with that lmao. It can’t ever be about just helping men. It’s gotta be about shutting down women too. Its only caring about men when it’s fucking convenient for them. It’s always gotta be that with these fucking people.

But I mean, just look at the comments. Telling the poster to cross post it to like r/twoxchromosomes and shit. 
Notice how any woman-related sub is “SJW” lmao

Perfect example how even sexual assault survival has to be all about men. It’s clearly a horrible, global-wide issue for women too. But this dude simply could not handle men not having the spotlight on ANY issue. If the facts were just presented simply not like it’s some fucking competition, i wouldn’t have minded. I hope at the very least, male survivors can see this and know they’re not alone and that they can be assaulted by women too. So many male survivors never say because they’re embarrassed or are told it’s impossible. 

The OP of the original thinks male survivors aren’t seen or heard because women are given all the attention. Ironically, male survivors get no aid or resources because of patriarchy. Funny how that works."
126,"Interesting they come to feminists when feminists were the ones who got the definition of rape changed to INCLUDE men. Feminists have done more to help male victims of rape then any other group and continue to be the ones to speak out and help male victims of rape...at the end of the day misogynists will blame women/feminists/""sjw"" for everything the patriarchy has caused.


Edit: I don't recommend anyone to go to that thread, it is full of so much misinformation and disingenuity there is no where to even start. They've even said that unpopularopinions is a feminist subreddit and no mens issues can ever be posted, that is like saying MensRights is a feminist subreddit."
127,"This man is a mra. His whole profile is simply anti-women. He’s a misogynist. MRA lie, mix up studies and leave out important information if they don’t simply twist it. He’s given sources so it looks legit because he knows no one will check them. And if someone does, it will be yelled down.
In this case: he’s the source, his intention is not good faith.

That’s all I’ll say to it and I personally don’t waste my time on what a MRA has to say about fairness, women and equality."
128,"\*Important things to highlight:

1. If women don't report and men don't report, can we compare the absolute # of rapes between the two groups and make a determination that one group has it worse? Like what is the point of comparing the statistics (# of rapes women report) to a study that says ""men are 9 times less likely to report""? That doesn't actually tell us anything about the absolute # of rapes of men vs. women.
2. What additional resources do survivors from either group get by ""winning"" this shit-sandwich competition of getting raped more?\* edited to add this point
3. Men are the perpetrators of most rapes for both groups
4. I think OP is just hoping that the wall of words and links will carry the argument and that most people won't notice the many flaws with comparing a bunch of not comparable data-sets."
129,This article is unpopular because it is ludicrous.
130,"This is a ridiculously dishonest post. Regardless of the sex of the victim, men make the majority of perpetrators for any category.

Everyone, regardless of their gender, needs to be taught in no uncertain terms to ask for and respect consent. Men however are the focus group because those are by any metric the category that commits most of those crimes."
131,"Feminists absolutely care about rape in its entirety, whether the victim is a man or woman. As a feminist, it’s great to see men who care about rape victims and want to work to lower sexual assault numbers. It can become problematic, however, when men say “men are victims too” as a way to dismiss discussions about sexual assault and rape against women. Some men use that argument not because they actually care about male sexual assault victims, but as a way to avoid hearing women’s experiences of sexual assault and rape. As for the “teachmennottorape” versus “educateourchildrenonconsent” phrases, I think they’re both great and we don’t have to choose one or the other. But again, completely removing “teachmennottorape” dismisses the long history of sexual assault and rape perpetrated by men against women and would be another way to ignore the vast number of women who’ve experienced sexual assault at the hands of a man."
132,"Can we just stop doing back of the napkin calculations or posting other people who did back of the napkin calculations? The main issue in all of this has been ""made to penetrate"" assaults. The CDC produces the most reputable research on this matter, and in recent years there has been a great deal of speculation about high MTP rates. The CDC doesn't publish raw numbers, and people weren't willing to wait for the CDC to do a deep dive, so they did a bunch of back of the napkin calculations. Fine. Whatever.

The problem with all of that, is that [the CDC has finally published a deep dive on male survivors.](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/men-ipvsvandstalking.html) They used the raw data and their numbers went through a review process, so their calculations are most likely to be right.

&#x200B;

* Nearly 1 in 4 men in the U.S. experienced some form of contact sexual violence in their lifetime.
* About 1 in 14 men in the U.S. were made to penetrate someone during their lifetime.
* More than 1 in 38 men in the U.S. experienced completed or attempted rape victimization in their lifetime.
* Among male victims of completed or attempted rape, about 71% first experienced such victimization prior to age 25.
* **87%** of male victims of (completed or attempted) rape reported only male perpetrators.
* **79%** of male victims of being MTP reported only female perpetrators.
* **82%** of male victims of sexual coercion reported only female perpetrators.
* **53%** of male victims of unwanted sexual contact reported only female perpetrators.
* **48%** of male victims of lifetime non-contact unwanted sexual experiences reported only male perpetrators.

Survey responses are still fluctuating, so **these numbers may well be revised in the coming years, but for now, this is our best data**. I for one am eagerly awaiting the next round of data.

OP's question feels like a blast from the past. I haven't heard anyone say ""teach men not to rape"" in several years, and I have NEVER seen a consent workshop that didn't presume both men and women needed education about consent. **Clearly consent education is paying off, because men are finally telling researchers about their experiences**. Of course, **there are many lessons to be learned from this new research and I hope it will help us ultimately prevent incidents of sexual violence.**

&#x200B;

Edit: Missing Words"
133,"Fact is if there was gender parity in rape, we would know it. Women face an uphill battle coming forward and being taken seriously, yet we still have accurate statistics on rates of male-on-female sexual violence. Even if the survivors themselves uniformly refused to come forward, there would be at least some instances in which witnesses reported the crimes, which would give us at least some idea of how common it is.

This is not to diminish the individual experiences of male rape survivors, which are real and just as serious as any sexual crime. However, if we're talking about numbers, there simply are more female than male survivors.

I question why anti-feminists and so-called ""men's rights activists"" are so invested in this false notion of statistical parity. Are the very real similarities in systemic obstacles and psychological trauma that survivors of all genders face not moving enough for them?"
134,"As a feminist this changes absolutely nothing to me. When I talk to anyone about rape the language is rarely ever gendered. People should not be seeking a sexual exchange from another person without consent. Feminism is about equality for all genders, which includes non-binary folks as well. It’s honestly shocking that this data show the instance of female to male rape so high but it doesn’t change the conversation. 

Everyone keep your hands off anyone unless you have consent. Be respectful of people’s boundaries. We tend to think that because a man  is stronger physically than a woman that he has less of a chance of being molested by a woman. That is deeply untrue. Just like men women are capable of many things. Rape being one of them. We are working toward building a better world based on mutual respect and equality."
135,Are they including male on male prision rape or are they not including prisoners as human like so many people?
136,"I think it shows a shock value which helps people remember and understand a fact. So if this graph is accurate, it has stuck with you. This graph and the teaching about consent can exist together."
137,"Just about every link refers to the same online survey. He could have just included that one source, but I think he thought it would seem more credible if he linked 50 articles talking about the same survey. Most data collected by surveillance agencies directly contradicts his findings. I think he’s cherry picked only the sources he wanted to read, and ignored the thousands that said what he disagreed with. The majority of organizations agree about demographics of victims and abusers, and that’s not caving under pressure because “feminism,” that’s just what the vast majority of findings show. 

I think men are abused nearly as often as women, and their abuse goes underreported, but the rest of his post seems kind of dishonest. And the further comments by him and the other men in the sub sort of prove this isn’t done as a way to heighten awareness to help male victims as much as it is to tell women to be quiet when they call out rape culture and misogyny. It seems more framed as a “gotcha!” than an actual concern, and the comments are trying to use the cherry picked data to argue feminism is unnecessary. The reason I like subs like r/menslib is because they are able to confront men’s issues and bring awareness to how men suffer in society, without needing to put down women’s issues in the process. 

That being said, I think we absolutely need to recognize male victims more. Many men in my life were molested, and amplifying their voices doesn’t have to necessarily silence the voices of female victims. Men often don’t come forward because they either don’t think they’ll be believed, or they’ll be seen as “weak,” and “less of a man.” When they’re victimized, especially by a female abuser, they’re laughed at or brushed off. You see it all the time in the media where sexual assault with a female perpetrator is used as a punchline. And when something about a kid getting raped by his hot teacher comes on the news, you see all these creepy disgusting comments about how that’s some sort of fantasy, and the child is “lucky.”

People would NOT be singing the same tune about a female victim. 

It’s an issue that is worth discussing definitely, and I try to address the internalized prejudices that I’ve developed when I see data that contradicts my assumptions, however I don’t think this post is the best example of that. I think everyone, men and women alike, should be taught about consent, and be punished when they violate another person’s body, but that doesn’t mean that we have to be dishonest and cherry pick findings to suit some kind of MRA agenda that society benefits women more so than men"
138,"if i'm correct, it's pointing out that females have just as much potential to rape, given the stats -  but not the number of incidents.  

i only tabbed through a few of the links.  
i'd assume the amount of assaults by male as compared to female offenses are a lot higher.   


like say there's a house of 100 men and a house of 100 women.   
in the male household FOUR were raped, 2 by men 2 by women -- technically ""half""  
but in the female household TWENTY were raped, 15 by men, 5 by women,"
139,"Feminism is based on women's issues and gender equality. Feminists understand that anyone is capable of being a violent, terrible person, regardless of gender, and generally are against gender-essentialism. However, it's disingenuous to take a ""centrist"" stance on sexual violence, or not take into account the disparity between how girls and boys tend to be raised in non-feminist households. It's outright malicious to falsify statistics to 'prove' that feminists are wrong, which brings me to my next point:

those statistics are false. Someone earlier in the thread linked to the actual cdc report, which showed different results than the ones posted to unpopular ""facts"". Even before I found that comment, I went ahead and fact-checked it myself since it's what everyone should be doing anyway. According to [RAINN, women and girls are 4 times more likely than any other demographic to experience sexual violence.](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence) Here's [another reputable source that says something different.](https://www.nsvrc.org/statistics) I'm obviously not saying that men aren't sexually assaulted, I actually believe there's a lot of men who don't come forward because of fear and shame. A lot of men's and women's issues intersect, which isn't surprising since sexism affects everyone. Men who don't fit into society's idealized standard are oppressed by the same system that oppresses women, and as one of those men, feminists have helped me more than anyone else."
140,who said anything else? do you think when children learn about consent we're going to ask girls to leave the room or something?

150,"You should be more specific and provide a page number.

I assume that you are talking about lifetime prevalence. It is true that women are more likely to be assaulted over the course of their lifetime, but lifetime prevalence is a less useful statistic because it doesn’t account for those who were repeatedly victimized, and it is affected by how society was previously.

If women were assaulted more often than men 30 years ago, then that would affect the lifetime prevalence. But that’s of little relevance to the nature of sexual violence today. When we measure current levels of sexual violence by asking people whether they have been raped/made to penetrate within the past year, it’s pretty equal,"
151,"> But it’s also disingenuous to pretend that women aren’t experiencing sexual violence and harassment at an alarming rate.

The post made direct comparisons between the rates of sexual violence against men and women and showed that they are similar.

> Statistically, the number one perpetrator of violence against women is men

Of course, most men are sexually attracted to women and most women are not sexually attracted to other women. What's your point? 

> Men do experience violence, sexual and otherwise, but the majority of their perpetrators are not women. 

This is downright dishonest. The OP directly addressed this common claim in his post, I don't think you even read it. 

Statistics showing that most male rape victims are raped by other men are due to the fact that women forcing penetrative sex onto men is typically not classified as ""rape"", but rather, as ""made to penetrate"". 

But men who were made to penetrate report mostly female perpetrators:

[""79% of male victims of being MTP reported only female perpetrators.""](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/men-ipvsvandstalking.html)

And men are more likely to be made to penetrate than raped.

https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf (pg 26, table 3.5)"
152,I agree on everything with you until the last phrase. Let me give you an example why: majority of violent crimes in the us is committed by African Americans. How would describe the phrase: Teach African Americans not to commit violent crimes? Pretty racist I say. Correlation does not equal causation as this phrase and a lot of people who promote it imply. Just because you're a man doesn't mean you're more inclined to rape. Rapists don't represent our gender. Furthermore this slogan exclude male victims and women rapists which is unfair. Teach our children not to rape is the real non sexist answer to it.
153,"Teaching children about consent but also telling them they can not consent seems quite contradictory, teach love and respect each other consent will come by it self."
154,"They are. But the one thing we have to point out is that HELLLAAAAA more women don’t report it than when they do. Because when it’s reported, an even smaller percentage actually gets a trial. And an even smaller percentage gets a charge. And then it’s super lower that someone goes to prison. I found this statistic on a while on rainn.org, but I couldn’t find the specific one. I did find a statistic on there that is broad for men and women, but it still leads into the similar pattern I just described. 

What men need to realize is that we recognize that they can be victims. We recognize that there are jerks who say it can’t happen because men can avoid it easier than us or say he probably liked it. That’s shitty, too. But those who use these male statistics also are the ones that do what we supposedly do and that is victim blame women victims. 

I think it’s important that men victims get justice and be able to talk about their experience. But it’s also important to remember that the statistics are telling us that more women are raped and DON’T get the justice for it."

This dataset has the breakdown of the gender of perpetrators,  and men that are made to penetrate report predominately only women as perpetrators ( \~ 70%) . Data cited and summarised in Stemple et al , 2017 (link below)

Men are only the majority of perpetrators when one is talking of female victims, or victimised queer men. When it is straight men that are victimised it isn't the case (again, does not surprise me - sexual violence, expect in very specific situations such as prison or war, generally reflects the sexual orientation of the perpetrator)."
164,"Rapists are rapists it's not a gender issue. That phrase means that men not women need to learn not to rape as if most of them are inclined to do it. If you replace those words with any group that does something is racist or sexist. Why isn't this the case for men too?

168,"The CDC National Intimate partner Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) sample does not include people who are incarcerated or otherwise institutionalized. 

But the Stemple paper referred to also looked at large surveys done in prison and jails by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). These surveys are mandated by the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). According to these surveys in US prisons and jails about 40% of sexual abuse reported by male inmates are perpetrated by other male inmates. 60% is perpetrated by staff. Female staff make up 60% of staff perpetrators. Which by calculating gives approximately 40% of male inmates who report sexual abuse while incarcerated report a female perpetrator. 


The most common perpetrator against female inmates is other female inmates - approximately 54%. Of the female inmates reporting sexual abuse from staff 30-40% reported the perpetrator were female staff. 


In juvenile detention centers its even worse. 90% of male youths who reported being sexually abused by staff reported that a female staff member was the perpetrator. Women made up 44% of the staff at the sampled youth detention centres.

You can't be serious.  None of what you said about male victims is different than saying female rape victims ""asked for it"" ""wanted it"" ""seduced the man while wearing revealing clothing"".  And yes, women are considered weak AND damaged goods when they're raped.  Just because the word ""lucky"" isn't used doesn't change the fact that ""lucky"" ""asked for it"" ""wanted it"" turns the victim into a willing participant in sex and even initiated it by seduction.

179,"> Just because you're a man doesn't mean you're more inclined to rape

We agree with you on this. But for some reason, the world has different ideas about men. Haven’t you heard phrases like “boys will be boys” and “he couldn’t help himself” and “[20 minutes of action](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/06/father-stanford-university-student-brock-turner-sexual-assault-statement)”? I don’t think that men are somehow biologically more inclined to rape, but I do think our current society gives the impression that men have less control of their behaviour around women, and does a shit job of teaching them what is consent and what is not. 

I already agreed teaching everyone is the *best* solution, but that doesn’t mean that men don’t disproportionately misunderstand consent more than women, and a focus on ensuring that they are being properly educated isn’t the same as assuming all black men are criminals, and it’s pretty disingenuous to say that, honestly. We aren’t assuming that all men are rapists, never have, we’re assuming that an unfortunately large percentage of them were poorly educated about consent and need to be re-educated."

I don’t think people realize how insanely underreported it is. And still so often women are blamed or not believed when they DO come forward."
184,"That’s a really good connection to the hatred Jewish people have faced. 

Man, i wish I did have a good response. All I can think to do is ask why they believe the attention is hogged. 

Like with male survivors of rape. Why does no one talk about it or focus on it? Because so many people don’t believe it happens. Why don’t they think it happens? They think it’s impossible because men are the strong, dominate ones, how could a biologically weaker woman rape them, of course!! (Which is clearly ignoring so many factors). Men always want sex, men probably enjoyed it, etc. All terrible ideas based in patriarchal ideas of men and women. In the end, if you keep asking for the source of their beliefs, the misconception is brought up."
185,"This article was written in 2014, and, since then, the numbers have continued to  fluctuate.

Maybe he didn’t hear you.” The statistics this guy found just completely ignored that. 

Now I’ve been seeing comments on whether rape has a gender or not. The act as a whole is not a gender because anyone of any gender is capable of it. But the gender that does it more is just the gender that does it more. When I have talked to men about this, they were the main ones to tell me those statements. They were the ones that told me it wasn’t a big deal. I am not as worried about a woman taking advantage of me as a man. Maybe a man sees it differently for them and that’s cool. I can’t doubt their experiences. But for me it’s that. It is more tolerated by boys to brag about it, not report the bros, or try to fiddle around to make sure that girl stays silent.

I’m not sure where you think I said that?

It’s teaching them that they get to be in charge of what happens to their bodies, and so does everyone else. Because consent isn’t just about “love” as you said. I’d argue that’s part of the problem we have now. People believe that because their actions come from a place of love, they can’t be problematic.

An example: how many parents force their children to hug and kiss their family members when they don’t want to? That is coming from a place of love, of wanting their children to be close to family members, and the family members aren’t trying to make the child upset, they want to share their love. That doesn’t make it ok. 

And that’s a good place to start when teaching children consent. Make it clear they don’t have to hug or kiss *anyone* they don’t want to. They are allowed to hug Aunty Joe but not Aunty Lisa. They are allowed to hug Uncle Dave this time, but if next time they don’t want to, that’s okay too. It’s basic shit, but if children learn these basic concepts from an early age, it’s a lot easier to wrap their heads around when suddenly it’s super intertwined with romantic feelings, puberty, alcohol, etc. etc. etc. 

I know lots of grown as adults who can’t grasp the basics around this, let alone when sex becomes a part of it."
222,"You’re not wrong about teaching children what love is and modeling it for them is a really great way to raise kids. Part of that is modeling the withdrawal of consent. Such as when I’m feeling really emotional and fragile, I may withdraw my consent for butt touching, but only because I need warm dosage hugs. That is about loving myself and respecting myself and my boyfriend. There is nothing contradictory about withdrawing my consent for anything type of touch with my boyfriend and he’s never thought it was because I didn’t love him. So."
223,"Such a good comment and really good explanation. Even now women are rarely ever believed or actually given support when they seek it after rape or sexual assault. I’m so sorry that happened to you, it’s so backwards and it kills me how often survivors hear garbage like that. The way rape is handled now, regardless of gender, is a result of patriarchy."
224,You don't have to wonder. The CDC uses two methods: they ask whether or not you were a crime victim in the last twelve months and they ask about your lifetime history. [These numbers already account for childhood molestation.](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf)
225,">You would expect them to have around the same lifetime numbers, perhaps the past 12 months would be different but certainly you would think the lifetime numbers would be similar. 

The 2010 report estimated that 1 in 17 men had been MTP in their lifetime. The 2015 report estimated that 1 in 14 men had been MTP in their lifetime.

Lifetime rates can change quite dramatically for two reasons:

* For both men and women, a large fraction of sexual assaults happen to people under the age of 18. In addition, at least for women, the majority of sexual assaults happen to people under 24 years of age. (I couldn't find the under 25 number for men.) This survey only includes adults, but they ask about the respondents lifetime. So we know have data on people who were still teenagers in 2010 and their experiences and if they experienced more assaults than their older peers, that would have a major impact. If people in their early twenties also reported more assaults, then we could easily see a reduction.

* People of all ages are more willing to talk about their experiences to researchers thanks to the increased awareness around sexual assault. 

In the world of sexual violence research, five years is a long time, but sure, i would be more confident in this data if it had stabilized after 2010."
226,Like that?
227,"You've completely missed the point I was making about your argument, but that makes sense now because it seems you also missed the larger points of teachmennottorape and blacklivesmatter.

These slogans do not alienate white men. The reality is that White men have no real place that we're alienated from. I mean, this is a feminist sub, and here I am commenting. I should, for all intents and purposes, be alienated from this sub, but here I am. And this, more than anything, is the larger point. 

Blacklivesmatter is not intended to alienate white men, the intention is to say that Black lives matter *too.* It is to point out the systemic racism in our legal system. And how white people are very often shielded from suffering the same consequences as black people for similar crimes for no other reason than the color of our skin. 

teachmennottorape is not intended to mean men don't get raped. It is intended to shed light on the fact that very often when a woman gets raped, the focus is not toward the rapist and the systemic sexism in the world that promotes that kind of toxic behavior as it really needs to be. Instead the focus is on what she was wearing, or why she was out at whatever hour, or in some of the more extreme cases, that she was asking for it, or actually even fucking wanted it. 

Look, I'm going to out on a limb here and guess that you too are a white male. That being the case, I'd like to state clearly to you that we are not being alienated or forgotten, not at all. It's just that sometimes, it's not about us, and our main job in those instances, is to support the people that are being harmed."

Funny that you guys never take that second step. Funny how you think ""the wage gap disappears when we control for everything that contributes to it"" is sound logic. Choices occur in a vacuum, do they?

> Height-archy and Beauty-archy are more prominent than the patriarchy so I can't even imagine how many other groups face discrimination more than women

tfw when you don't know what the patriarchy is but keep naming stuff that's part of it. embarrassing

> Women are very opprssed in some parts of the world, you should focus on these areas

This is called ""the fallacy of relative privation."" This is poor logic. The existence of problems elsewhere in the world does not negate the importance of problems in your own backyard. Oppression is not just something ""other"" cultures do.

> instead of blaming western men 

Most feminists do not think that sexism is something that all men do to all women, or that every man consciously oppresses every woman. When discussing patriarchy, it is important to remember that you are discussing a culture, a set of societal expectations and rules that govern how men and women act.

https://youtu.be/oQbei5JGiT8

That example is of one of the common traditional atitudes to what people think a child should do this is based on the parents teaching (not what is love as a whole). The force part needs an example and back story of the parents teaching.

Counter example:
A doctor performing ""male circumcission"" (MGM type 1) on a baby boy even though he is crying and in pain. **The parent were taught** it as part of theur culture and that at it is more hyginic and has medical benefits.

Contraversal counter example:
A doctor permed ""female cicumcission"" (FGM type 1a) on a baby girl even though she is crying and in pain. **The parent were taught** it as part of their culture and that it is more hyginic and has medical benefits.
https://femalecircumcision.org/ (FGM type 1a and WHO refuses to answear as always 😠)

The above two is another case where the parent have forced their child through processed that they did not consent but thanks to ""educational research"" they can defend the act thriugh science and not just culture (which us still the case because of the MGM FGM divide) and religion.

If you think you are right you should be against all acts that parent enforce on children this will include vacination, baths, feeding, changing napies etc. (As they all can and are attacked and defended the same way hug/kisses/MGM/FGM are)."

I don't care what a phrase wants to mean, the issue is what it means. I support all people being harmed but it's not only people as it has lately been promoted. And see all the controversy about blacklives matters could be solved by adding a too. As for rape toxic sexual behavior is not exclusive to men just because they're the majority doesn't mean we must exclude other groups women that have members that rape. Terms like mansplaining, manspreading, pay gap always vilify men. When was the last time feminists that care for all genders as they said that hey men get raped too why not include all rape victims. Imagine what it feels for a male rape victim to be considered to be less important, where did empathy go? Why is it so difficult to change a word to make the message inclusive for everyone?"
237,">Funny that you guys never take that second step. Funny how you think ""the wage gap disappears when we control for everything that contributes to it"" is sound logic. Choices occur in a vacuum, do they?

Studies show that the more equal a country is the more different carrier choices men and women make. Yes, choices don't occur in a vacuum but I'm also not entitled to decide for women what choices are better for them and  forcing more equal choices is not necessarily empowering since this is happening in less equal countries as studies show.  Men and women have different interests and they're entitled to that. Think about incels, they claim  that women make choices that disadvantage men (women choosing only  ""Chads"" over ""normies"") to explain why there are so many more virgin men than virgin women in the US today, guess what I'd say to them? *So what!?* Women are entitled to their choices and they are entitled to make different choices from men, people are entitled to have diffeent interests, different interests are no evidence for discrimination. Humanities are just as noble as STEM and it should be this way.

243,"Thank you, that's Interesting. BIGI is probably not a perfect indicator for gender inequality, apparently it gets most countries right in the scale, as you can see in the chart https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/BmBN2cHlvDAOZE5lcYt7cph3Yi0=/filters:format(png)/media/img/posts/2018/02/Screen_Shot_2018_02_16_at_12.33.16_PM/original.png

but there are weird exceptions like Saudi Arabia, the author does address this:

> Some readers may be surprised that Saudi Arabia, frequently portrayed as unfair to women in the media [35,36], has a relatively high level of overall average gender parity. This seems contradictory, because much has been reported about restrictions on women's rights in Saudi Arabia (e.g., the Saudi government only recently changed its policy on women driving a car), while Northern European countries have a reputation for progressiveness (including female participation in national politics). Apart from other academic research showing that ""Islam, democracy and gender equality are not inherently incompatible"" ([37], p. 518), three critically important points should be noted here.
> 
> The first is that the lack of gender inequality does not imply that women or men have abundant opportunities in life (see Introduction), and neither does it mean that a country is free of sexist attitudes; all that matters for the expression of gender parity using the BIGI (or any other composite measure of gender inequality) is whether there are overall differences in disadvantages between the sexes. Indeed, Saudi Arabia has much to do, because girls fall behind considerably in educational opportunities (7%, S1 Table), while men fall behind in both healthy life span and life satisfaction.
> 
> It is exactly because of this potential of having a low level of average overall gender inequality and still have relatively large disparities in the individual components that we have also provided a score for the average absolute deviation from parity (AADP); this better reflects the amount of work to be done (in a society) to resolve all relevant gender disparities as captured by the BIGI. We have ranked the BIGI according to this latter score (S1 Table). It should be noted that our approach of ranking in accordance to the average absolute deviation from parity is a novelty in gender equality indicators. It is another dimension that should be taken into account when comparing nations; it is particularly useful to prevent overestimation of progress in countries in which both men and women fall behind in different aspects of life (such as in Saudi Arabia).
> 
> Second, as argued in the introduction, the general focus in the area of gender inequality is often on issues relevant to women, while discounting men's issues. For example, while the issue of Saudi women not being allowed to drive has received much media attention, little is reported about issues affecting Saudi men. Little is written, for example, about the challenges many lower-status men have in finding a partner in a country where polygyny is legally practiced, yet this almost certainly undermines their health and wellbeing, as well as their life satisfaction. Moreover, although girls fall behind in educational opportunities (e.g., years schooling), the girls that attend school outperform boys by a larger degree than in many other countries [38], raising questions about Saudi education for boys as well. In this context, we would like to note that the often-touted bias toward the interests of men applies to high status men, not men in general.
> 
> Third, differences in cultural and religious views may influence one’s assessment of advantages and disadvantages in life. For example, most people in Saudi Arabia subscribe to a set of societal rules that may be difficult to understand from a Western point of view and may well be seen as a disadvantage by non-Muslims. Common examples are extended periods of fasting, dietary rules, and dress code, all of which are considered as a discomfort to non-believers, but are an integral part of social life in this context. In short, disadvantages cannot always be defined objectively. The overall life satisfaction score is culturally independent, and therefore may be a better broad measure of advantages and disadvantages that people experience in their lives than a composite of variables (e.g., wage gap) that may be more relevant in some contexts than others.
> 
> It should be noted that of the three components, education shows the most variability across nations, and is the factor that can be most directly influenced by governments. It is also a factor that is recognized as influencing one’s opportunities in life and is seen as a valuable resource in most places in the world [39].

One can make two possible conclusions from all of this: A) BIGI + AADP is a  perfect or good enough index to measure gender equality, thus the gender equality paradox holds true. B) BIGI + AADP is useless, gender differences in carrier choices don't follow any pattern that can be measured in a non-shallow way today.

In any case there's no evidence that suggests that less societal discrimination against women is correlated with more equal carrier choices, we probably have some evidence for the opposite instead. Automatically blaming the patriarchy is the wrongest conclusion one can make on the issue at the moment.

What is your opinion about this topic?"
244,"I mean Joe Biden also called Anita Hill a liar so honestly, not that surprising. He's a problematic dude which is why I didn't vote for him in the primary."
245,Absolutely disgraceful.
246,"Whoa. Has this really happened? That's awful if this is the case and goes to show you so many people are hypocritical about sexual assault/rape/sexual harassment. They are upset about it when someone they hate commits the crime, but when it's someone they support, they dismiss it. I'm glad I've seen some other feminists on Twitter who are upset about this."
247,"The only ones I saw get accused of that were Symone Sanders and Jill Filipovic.  Jill responded that all her tweets are autodeleted so she didn't delete anything, plus she has no role with a campaign.  That said, she was really reserved in her language about Reade, not quite spitting the hot fire she appropriately was about Ford two years ago.  

More complex thought: everyone in every movement across the political spectrum compromises their principles in exchange for access to power.  This is not a unique thing to feminism.  That doesn't mean it's good anywhere.  Basically, if you have any ideological beliefs, you will always hate politics.  It is and has always been a power game designed to be won by people who at some fundamental level care about nothing, or at least very little -- or at least are willing to be extremely flexible."
248,"It shows their lack of integrity and that they are more committed to Biden and the democratic party establishment than they are to anything resembling a cause.

Sadly the other option is even worse. That's what this country has come to. All because of white men being unable to cope with the times."
250,"On the deleting things they said about Kavanaugh and Blasey Ford - since I don't know the state of mind of the advisors and staff on the deletion of the tweets I am unsure what to think. I do think that they should not have deleted those tweets since they have a position of power and everything they have ever written should be forever on the internet.

That being said, I think that Biden doing unwanted contact is disgusting. I would like more investigation, more interviews by Reade, and more people who are experts on sexual trauma to be involved in the process, both to help treat Reade and to inform people."

In regard to the later, in my state if the couple is not married the father has to sign an affidavit of paternity to be on the birth certificate, so a woman can’t name just any man as the father."
263,"If they are the father then they are the father. If jt is a false claim a simple paternity test can set it straight.

Women dont just go about hiding pregnancies and then trick naming men once the kid is born. If they are hiding it, it means they dont want them to know and will keep the father's name hidden, except for extraordinary circumstances.

This sentence also confuses me - ""the only way for the named father to reject that is through the court as opposed to something like a mandatory paternity test..."" How could there be a mandatory paternity test without the court system? The only way that anything that is ""mandatory"" is through the court system."

If you ever end up in a situation where the paternity of the child is in question-- either in advance of signing a birth certificate or when faced with a child support or custody case after signing one, you are fully legally entitled to request and perform a paternity test. Retail kits cost as little as $30 and the maximum for a legal test is \~$500. 

If a woman hid/is hiding a pregnancy from you she's unlikely to put your name on the birth certificate or ask for child support later as there's likely to be some underlying cause for hiding it in the first place."

267,"I don't really have a problem with it, especially because if a pregnant person is concealing a pregnancy-- a difficult thing to do in most cases-- there's probably a reason. Obviously if a named man believes he is not the father then a paternity test would be in order. ""Mandatory paternity tests"" at point of birth is not only a massive privacy violation but it is just more government-enshrined distrust of women."
268,">... and... that woman to name any man as father without notice?

[Citation needed]

I felt like this was something that a) varies by jurisdiction, and b) I was skeptical of as a claim. So I went to my state's webpage about paternity and custody issues, and it notes, explicitly: 

>You cannot establish paternity just by saying someone is the child(ren)’s father.

And then goes on to explain the requirements for even a genetic test to be considered valid proof of paternity (for example, you need a chain of custody document from the Lab to ensure samples weren't switched). 

As you note, a presumed father has the ability to contest paternity by requesting a test. I guess I don't understand why that's an insufficient solution. In the vast majority of cases, paternity is not contested, so why add in extra costs, etc, for a routine custody situation?"
269,"Women should be able to conceal (or more appropriately, not reveal) their pregnancies, it is private medical information.

271,"> Is this a hypothetical? What do you mean by ""name any man as father without notice?"" What legal repercussion does this have on the named ""father?""

We've gotten this question before-- I think he's assuming, possibly, a one-night stand or affair or something in which the woman becomes pregnant, hides the pregnancy, and then the father gets hit up for child support without ever having known there was even a child in the first place.

These questions always paint it as though women can (and do!) name whoever they want on the birth certificate and then the man  is just automatically on the hook for Big Cash Money and there's no recourse, which... is really not how it works."

277,"But much the claim of distrust or emotional abuse can be used to stop him. If it were just rolled into the normal labor process (also who says the government would be doing the tests they would just be saying the test is part of it) it would give him a true ability to do so without coercement.

Does that mean nothing?"
278,"> the claim of distrust or emotional abuse can be used to stop him

No it can't. How would that work? ""You have to pay child support, but you're not allowed to verify that this child is actually yours?"" Nah.

279,"In my state, an unmarried man has to sign to be named on the birth certificate, so he consents to be on it.  If he does not consent, the mother can get a court ordered paternity test.

For me anyways, can’t speak for all women, I want to be assumed as capable for any job. I want to not be asked about starting a family and having babies. I want women who chose not to have babies or get married not be made to feel bad for it.

There isn’t even equality based on the law. 

Women and men are routinely treated very differently for example in family court. A situation that harms men. 

Feminism seeks to abolish ALL inequalities, including the ones that harm men.

I also don’t understand how you claim equality exists. This is just really naive. 

If you actually are interested there are a couple good websites with actual statistical data, I could recommend... but the tone of your post makes me think you are fishing for some sort of angry inflammatory responses. (FYI, you are unlikely to get that here. This sub is not about that.) 

Anyways...

This is a blog where people post incidents of everyday sexism. If you really are curious there are thousands upon thousands of accounts in multiple languages all over the world. Every day people post on here. (And it’s not just women.)

Here is a study I just read that was particularly interesting to me as an educator:

It is a study on sexism in schools:

If anyone has recommendations please post."
288,The vast majority of power and capital are in the hands of men.
289,"That wasn't meant to offend anyone, it's just that in the past when I ask I've always received very short, common answers that don't really prove or mean anything, they just seem like an easy way to get out of a question. That's why I tried to clarify what I was looking for"
290,Sexism in law is still extremely prevalent. During articling I was told by a partner at my firm that I had better not get pregnant if I expected to have a career in law. He 'didn't see how a woman's career could ever recover from a pregnancy.' He pretty much stated that if you don't make partner before having kids you will be unable to find a good footing in your career. It really made me take note of how many young women left the firm after maternity leave while none of the young fathers seemed to experience the same issues.
291,"I don't understand why everyone gets so man because we want actual answers. It just ends up looking like you are unable to give them. I'm not looking for an argument or trouble, I was asking for somebody to explain a different point of view. I thought I might actually get an answer since I hear feminist saying that don't want to be taken for people who just get mad and are ruled by emotion. I respectfully tried to give it a chance. I'm beginning to see the reality of it. Nobody on this subreddit actually wants to answer questions. So thanks but no thanks for your insults and 0% useful answers."
292,"I mean ya kinda just look a bunch of stuff out of context, so ya it's gonna look like bs. But sure, take it all the wrong way and get people mad, because that's apparently what this whole thing is about."
293,"Have you considered that maybe some women don't get as high of a raise because on occasion some don't deserve it? Not comparing to men but similar to something I've seen where people get fired for being late everyday and then say it's because theyre a woman. Simply ""using the woman card"" I have seen a lot in my life. I just feel like sometimes those things like not getting a higher raise are justified not because they're women but because some are less qualified. As a society we should be hiring and bringing people in based on qualification, and not gender or race, don't you think?"
294,"First of all, you got toxic real fast even though I even said I tried to be polite. I was looking for answers to my questions, not insults but thanks anyway. Downright telling me I'm wrong doesn't answer questions it's actually just avoiding a question so congrats. The main reason feminism is seen as only looking for good for women is because its a female based movement. If it was really looking out for everybody it wouldn't really be called feminism. Also about how you said feminism abolished all inequalities, it actually seems like it just makes life horribly insufferable for the once dominant gender, men. So overall, apologies if I offended you, but I feel I deserved no such disrespect if I only wanted a few answers from a sub reddit that's literally for that."
295,">Personally, I've never seen any acts againts women in my entire life, and every time I hear an example such as ""women pay more for haircuts"" I can always think of ways its not true or reasons behind it like (generally) ""women have more hair"", ""barbers might have different prices"", ""more hair products"" ""women worry about it more"" and also I've never even seen that happen.

You're kind of close to getting it. 

Gender discrimination isnt neccesarily overt. People have internal biases, do you agree with that?

These internal biases factor in to how we treat people. So while somone may honestly beleive they arent sexist, they may push their sons into engineering by buying them legos and their daughters into being a stay at home parent by buying them an easy bake oven. 

An employer may point to the women they've hired as an example oh how they arent sexist they are, but fail to see that they're favoring men when it comes to leadership roles.

Further, I'm sure pro-life people for example see what they're doing as violating a womans bodily autonomy, but whatever their motivations are, the results are the same. So I know that the amount of people who will proudly say they hate women is small (although MGTOW, Red pillars, and incels exist) there are plenty of people who perpetuate sexism against women though their attitudes and behaviors.

>""fixing others opinions"" by my understanding is not what this movement is about. If it is, then apologies but I won't stand for it. 

Why?

Fixing other people's opinions is the foundation of all activism and social progress. 

Let's apply it to a mens issue.

Men are more likely to die via suicde, right? Well if someone said ""they need to just man up"" as opposed to seeking help, I would say they have the wrong opinion. I would seek to change it. If enough peoples opinions change, you change the culture surrounding male suicide.

Do you think women should have the right to vote? Because that used to not be a particularly common opinion.

>Second question, don't you think it's gone too far? As a person who already believes we have equality it just seems very overused at this point.

As long as womens issues exist, why shouldn't there be a movement that seeks to right those issues?

Why shouldn't there be a movement that seeks to eliminate sexual assault, domestic violence, workplace discrimination, etc?

Even if you dont think these problems are as common as somebody else thinks they are, they are issues that happen and they disproportionately affect women (which does not mean they cant also affect men.)

Question: do you also frequent the MRA sub and tell them you think we already have equality and ask them when enough will be enough?"
296,"I got pregnant as a first year lawyer at a big firm. My dad was also a litigator. His first response to my pregnancy announcement was to ask if I was going to keep it, in light of my career. 

All of my career decisions since that time have involved prioritizing time with my children over prestige and salary. Meanwhile, my husband's career trajectory has been all upward in both. As a result, I am financially dependent. A trial separation showed me and the kids quite clearly how dependent I am. For example, they *really* resented sharing a room. 

In working on our marriage, he has begun to finally pull his weight with caregiving, but that partner was right; my career can't even begin to recover until our children are adults."
297,"I spy an emotional reaction, Captain."
298,"There is a huge body of literature out there on Feminism 101. Folks here are unlikely to take the time and effort to walk you through it. 

You've just shown up and regurgitated a ton of antifeminist talking points we see multiple times a week, so no one is particularly interested in addressing these for the hundredth time with some dude who thinks he's come up with a hot take that Sexism Is Fake and Feminism Has Gone Too Far."
299,What are you talking about?
300,Nothing was taken out of context. You're initiating your post with a bunch of rude condescension - do you really expect anyone to respond well to that?
301,"> Have you considered that maybe some women don't get as high of a raise because on occasion some don't deserve it? 

Yes. We have. We take that into account.

> Not comparing to men but similar to something I've seen where people get fired for being late everyday and then say it's because theyre a woman. Simply ""using the woman card""

Sociological research that proves the gender gap is not based on people's feelings. It's based on hard data.

> I just feel like sometimes those things like not getting a higher raise are justified not because they're women but because some are less qualified

You're doing what you accuse us of: basing your assumptions on what you want to be true. Reality: the research that proves the gender gap is based on hard data, not feelings. You should start using research & data too, like we do.

> As a society we should be hiring and bringing people in based on qualification, and not gender or race, don't you think?

Yes, we agree. Right now we don't do that, and sexism is common in hiring/promotions/etc.. We want to end sexism that causes that kind of discrimination to happen (yes, including against men for jobs like teaching elementary school). Notwithstanding your accusation that sexism in the workplace doesn't exist, it does, and (for this part you agree with us) we want it to end."
302,"So I’m glad the people in comments below addressed the “woman card” thing you mention because I won’t touch on that. 

I do want to remind you though that while the utopian life we want has people hiring based on qualifications, in reality that doesn’t happen. Study after study proves that people of color that have equal qualifications lose jobs to white peers. We unfortunately have so many prejudices ingrained in us through societal norms that we have to be AWARE of them when doing things like hiring, renting out a home or apartment, admitting or denying applications, etc. Your comment there rang an alarm for me so I wanted to put that out there. 

You mention women getting things because they’re women, that’s not what true feminists want either. I’d maybe like some examples so I can address them as well, just curious what those situations were. We just want to be treated equally in all regards."
303,This user was not “toxic” to you. Be warned.
304,"I agree to an extent, I think part of what makes it that way is the attitude older lawyers have, it's not just an inevitably. My husband is also a lawyer at a more progressive firm where they seldom lose young mothers, prioritize family time for all their lawyers and even promoted one of their lawyers to partner during her maternity leave. That partner was right about my career there because he thinks he is and he sits on the hiring committee. The main problem is for me is that you can't tell which type of firm you're going to get until you already work there, and there are far more who hold that discriminatory attitude than ones who do not. 

I left my firm and work for the government now, I probably won't ever go back to private practice. Partially because I honestly can't handle the stress and partially because there's a lot less sexism in government legal work. My male supervisor was planning on taking a long paternity leave before covid hit, while I don't know any men who work in private practice who have been able to do so. 

To your point about women being put in the position where their career suffers while their husbands does not, I think this is also huge in law. Most of the male senior partners I know tend to have a spouse who has sevely hampered her own career to take care of their household while the female senior partners are either divorced, have hired help, or are stressed to breaking point at all times. It isn't a career that seems to leave space for both parties in a marriage to be happy and still have children. I really hope your husband comes around, so few men seem to grasp the career implications (and the mental health implications) of unevenly divided domestic work"
305,"It seems like the OP thinks any response from a woman is an “emotional reaction.” 

I could literally copy out formulas from one of my economics classes and I would be accused of being toxic, because my user name obviously indicates I’m a woman. :)"
306,"All of those answers seem reasonable, so thank you for answering them honestly. One last thing, are you aware there are those exceptions of ""feminists"" that use the woman card to get away with things? Those people of course taint the feminism reputation?"
307,"> You mention women getting things because they’re women, that’s not what true feminists want either.

How exactly do you justify gender quotas in the general workforce then?  Not boardroom or political office (could care less) , but general workforce.
I know it's been said that they're worried that the <insert underrepresented women field here, let's pick tech today> industry is discriminating against women and other minorities, and that quotas in theory give space for qualified diverse people, but if you give 50% of the job slots to a group that is <20% of the applicants, how is that not demanding that women just be given the job on the grounds that they're women?  Or do you think that 50% is an overestimate?  Because many companies will say that they will immediately make 50% of their workforce women even when women don't comprise a large number of the applicants."
308,That's a threat. And their attitude was very uncalled for and unprovoked. They let anger and displeasure for my question get in the way of a logical answer and I didn't appreciate it. I shouldn't be threatened for this.
309,"It's just the stupid bullshit these Logic Guys do where they trumpet this ""facts don't care about your feelings"" type stuff, but they've thoroughly convinced themselves *their* feelings ARE facts, and that their emotional reactions are merely ""logical and rational,"" even when they aren't. We had a pretty good thread about that the other day."
310,"This is a stupid question because when men behave badly we're encouraged to be sure it's ""NOT ALL MEN"" but then when a woman or feminist behaves badly it's ""wow, this person sure makes feminism look bad!"""
311,"Yes, I know some people use imagined oppression as an excuse to cover for their own failings. (That was very common for white students at the college I went to - for many of them, it was their second-choice college and they believed, despite vast evidence to the contrary, that racial preferences had meant they didn't get into the college they wanted.)

Women sometimes do that as well - notwithstanding the actual discrimination they also face.

Some of those women who do so probably call themselves feminists, though in my experience feminists are less likely to convince themselves of oppression that doesn't exist.

Do those people taint the feminist reputation?

No. Anti-feminists making them up (individual cases or the scale of the 'problem') taint the feminist reputation. But actual feminists are not likely to ""play the victim"" - we're just honest about the world around us. Our ACTUAL actions don't taint our reputation (or at least our positive actions outweigh our mistakes quite heavily). The false claims of others about our thoughts and beliefs do."
312,"I never said I agree with gender quotas for all job markets lol. I think what should be done is intentionally seeking out candidates to fill roles that maybe normally wouldn’t and to be mindful of their workforce demographics. Companies can’t control who applies to them or what applicant qualifications are but they CAN diversify ways they recruit to try and bring in more diverse applicants. 

That’s where my opinion needs to end though because I’m not an expert in any business field so I can’t really speak adequately to equitable hiring practices. But.. I think being mindful of a company’s demographics and seeking to reasonably diversify them isn’t really that big of a deal ."
313,"I like that someone being irritated with you is an illogical display of emotion but you getting your feelings hurt by a mod asking you to abide by the rules is... what, Facts and Logic?"
314,"It’s a warning. That’s what mods do, we give warnings. And if the warnings aren’t followed, then we exercise our other mod capabilities. 

You’re the one getting hostile here. This isn’t an appropriate way to have a discussion on this sub."
315,"Eh, to be fair, I'm not confident the author of that comment knows that the ""acting badly"" is outlier behavior rather than promoted & taught by the philosophy behavior."
316,"Quiet and shy ladies - not weird at all. Obedient? Oof. I don’t like the idea of any romantic partner required to be obedient, whether man, woman or other. I am not necessarily bothered by the connotation of connections to the past and stricter gender roles since I believe people can be whatever they want. However for me there are two red flags. 

Firstly, the term ‘strong, independent woman’ is usually underhanded code for ‘domineering/bossy’ which is a many layered onion of problems. 

Secondly, people who are abusive to their romantic partners often seek out those who are vulnerable or willing to be controlled, even if just in small ways early on. Obviously this is not the case for all men who prefer a more submissive partner however the reasoning behind it is worth self reflection. Generally an obedient, submissive partner will make the other person feel more in control. Why do they crave that control? What is their internal relationship with their own masculinity like?"
317,"I'm shy, and not very assertive in relationships. I like to be laid back and ""go with the flow""

But I'm not submissive or obedient

As an adult it's not very mature to be obedient unless it's obeying the law, adhering to the rules and procedures at work and natural laws (like gravity). Maturity means thinking for ourselves and making our own choices, even when it's hard.

It's important for our mental health to consider ourselves equal to others, not submissive

But none of that is feminism, exactly. It's psychology. It's life experience. It applies to men, women and children. It applies to relationships, work, and community. It's just important to have a sense of self and take responsibility for our own lives and not give that away to other people. 

It's a hard lesson to learn when a person is shy and quite by nature. But it's possible to quietly take responsibility for ourselves develop a strong sense of self"
318,"I mean...I haven’t seen those things. But I don’t think a majority of feminists or people in general shame women for having softer more submissive personalities nor do they shame men who date women like that. 

The problem comes when there’s an expectation for *all* women to be these submissive housewives who have no goals of their own except to submit their entire lives to their husbands. Which is an idea that should concern everyone, you included.

That’s why Feminism is about choice. You have the right to choose what type of life you want for yourself without any type of pressure pushing you one way or another. But I think you already know that as most people who come here do. Why would any of us say it’s totally fine to just bash women for their life choices? 

If you could, it would be great if you could provide some examples/sources of where you’ve seen Feminists shaming these other women you speak of because again, I’ve never seen it personally."
319,"How would anyone know if a man prefers obedient women unless he goes around telling women aren't into it that he wants them to obey him? If a man has a preference and is just drawn to certain personality types, I'm sure no one would even notice. 

Have you considered that other people might just have a preference for those who *don't* demand obedience from others? Why are you shaming those people for their preference?"
320,">I see men being shamed constantly for liking quiet, shy or obedient women.

Because women are human beings not dogs. Any person who expects another person to be obedient to him should be shamed and they need to look deep into themselves on why they can't handle a partner being equal to them."
321,"If a man says he prefers a submissive woman, yeah, that raises some flags. Why would it not? A relationship should be a partnership of equals."
322,"I have never seen this, do you have sources for 'constantly' being shamed?It also would be very dependent upon WHY they have the 'preference' for 'obedient' women. obedient is a very worrying word and if its because they'e been raised to want an 'obedient, submissive' woman because that's a woman's rightful place, that's not a preference, that's misogyny

Can i ask why you felt the need to point out you're a straight woman?"
323,"OK I will try to answer part by part:

If a guy wants a quiet and shy woman, I don´t see any feminist issue with that, because that´s a personality trait anyone can have on their own. But if the want an obedient woman, that´s a problem because that relates to her being a lesser partner than him, meaning it´s not a personality trait but rather a role she assumes, as in: He is calling the shots, she is following. That´s not an equal partnership, why would you actively seek that?

Concerning women being shamed for wanting to be a housewife: That´s not feminist and not OK. Every person should have the freedom to choose what they want with their life.

Concerning shaming women for listening to their partners: Well, why are they listening to their partners? Because they love them and value their opinion? If so, great! Because they think men should lead, no matter if they are right? If so, not great!

&#x200B;

Word of caution: All this is a bit different in D/s relationships. It can be problematic with them, too, but usually they are the result of MORE thought about consent and gender roles than the average relationship, so it´s harder to judge from the outside, at least for me."
324,"I think the reaction comes from sensitivity to how women have always been expected to be quiet/submissive/obedient in the past. And hell, even in the present. 

Like there’s a difference between naturally preferring that kind of personality, and thinking women HAVE to be that way. Personally speaking, I was taught that women are built to be that way. In my fundamentalist church, women weren’t allowed to give sermons or announcements and were expected to be housewives. If you know Girl Defined, they’re a perfect example of what women are expected to be like in the traditional sense. 

There are lots of quiet, introverted girls, and some men out there might find that to be their type. And truly, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. However I think it should come from a place of wanting it truly for themselves, and not because they think they have to. It’s all about having freedom to be that way, rather than being expected to be that way. 

It’s when it’s a forced power difference based on gender that it’s fucked up. Like “this is what women SHOULD be” is the attitude that people don’t like. And if a guy says that’s his type, people might assume it’s influenced by outdated ideas. I think wording is important there. In describing a girl like that, a guy should probably (most definitely) forgo words like “submissive” and “obedient” because those will 100% give the impression that he wants a girl based on traditional values alone."
325,"Admittedly obedient was a strong word to use, but similar to what I'm trying to get across. I don't think anyone should be shamed for what they like in a relationship. And if a man likes a woman like that, it doesn't always or even usually mean abusive. It could just be preference on personality."
326,"Obedience does not mean you don't ever think for yourself ,submission does not mean you're not an equal.

 for a lot of us it's a natural part of our personality that we are shamed for, obedience can be like acts of service a way to show love it does not mean we think less of ourselves.  the idea that either of those things mean we are less than is simply untrue and extremely harmful to the women who naturally express ourselves this way. 

 being obedient or submissive does not mean we do not have a sense of self it means we know ourselves and know how we express our love to our partners the fact that people are trying to take that from us and tell us that we don't know ourselves we don't have a sense of self because of who we are is ridiculous and harmful 

The fact that men are not allowed to express a preference for receiving love in that sort of way without being shamed is sexist these are all feminist issues so saying that is not feminism doesn't make it not feminism these are issues caused by feminism"
327,"Honestly, I never expect total obedience from dogs or children, either

Obedience in an adult is a red flag that they were too abused at a young age and were trained to not have opinions. Every ""obedient"" woman I've ever met had a history of severe trauma"
328,"I think you might be taken my words too literally. It's not that they aren't equal, it's just that some women have those personalities and I don't feel they should be shamed for it. And some men like women who are less opinionated just as some men like more opinionated women. That's all I mean"
329,I think the issue is that most people such as yourself misunderstand what submission means in the context of relationships. Also one partner having a more submissive personality isn't a bad thing. A lot of people do have submissive personalities and women are shamed for having those personality traits and are forced into positions where they have to completely change who they are that is not better than them finding somebody who accepts them wholeheartedly
330,"Some women want to be obedient though. Put it that way and things change don't they? I believe women and men should be allowed to like whatever they want. Also I pointed it out because in the past I've been shamed for being ""a hateful man who just hates women"" even though I only ask questions.  I was just trying to avoid as many conflicts as possible because some people get very opinionated."
331,"So are you dismissing a mans preferences just because they come from tradition? I don't see the issue with tradition. I personally love traditional and it seems like a lot of what I'm seeing is trying to erase all of it. So let me ask you, is feminism souly based on the dislike for a traditional lifetyle? Do all feminists hate it? Is its goal to erase it from people's minds and give them other ideas?"
332,"Well if that’s your opinion then run with it friend, it’s all good. My personal opinion is that a lot of men who want submissive girls have more fragile egos and masculinity that feel too challenged by a woman who has her own opinions and isn’t afraid to stand up for herself. Does it bother me? Heck no. Different strokes for different folks. Not sure what you’re wanting here though, nobody was shaming anyone."
333,"expecting  someone to be obedient is literally unequal. its a power imbalance. you cannot have equality with one partner always obedient or submissive, that is not possible.    
you also seem to confused 'less opinionated' with obedient. being less opinionated does not make someone obedient."
334,"It’s funny, I never hear men referred to as ‘opinionated’ or not."
335,">Admittedly obedient was a strong word to use, but similar to what I'm trying to get across. 

We will take the words you use, since they are the words you intend."
336,"I have a very timid, shy personality. That's my choice. For someone to expect another person to be timid and obedient while they are in charge is different, it shows they have a need for power in the relationship and its puts the other person in a risky position of being abused, which happens too often. 


If the man himself is timid and shy and would prefer a woman with the same personality as him that's ok because he is looking for an equal who is compatible, not someone to rule over."
337,The issue is not with men who want submissive women or women who are submissive or obedient the issue is the group you posted this in. People in this group do not care about women who are different than they are especially those that are more traditional they do not want to know how obedience or submission can be a positive thing in relationship they do not care. if anything they are extremely negative about men having preferences that they feel comfortable expressing and I believe a lot of that is from the insecurities these women especially in this group have I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this and I do not care. I'm not trying to be rude but as a traditional woman as someone who is naturally more submissive and is happy being a housewife and has found a man who prefers this lifestyle as well me and my partner are attacked and shamed constantly I am told that I should be forced into positions that change who I am but I should change who I am to my very core that my partner has to be abusive because he wants somebody who is happy being in service of him as a way to show love and I am sick and tired of it of course no one in this group will admit that this stuff happens because that's how they avoid dealing with the problematic behaviors within their own group
338,"That's BDSM, and there are many feminist communities that celebrate it. There are many suggestions and guides on rules for how to engage in power imbalances safely, including the establishment of safewords. Do you have a safeword with these women you want to obey you? can they opt out at any time? We don't know the circumstances wherein you were told you were hateful. Was it an intimate partner who told you you hate women?"
339,">So are you dismissing a mans preferences just because they come from tradition? 

Patriarchal, sexist tradition."
340,"Not all tradition is good. This country used to hang black people as a pastime. Progress is necessary in order to survive and it’s your job as a functioning member of society to keep up. 

Nobody is getting rid of stay at home moms, and weddings, and backyard BBQs. We’re just trying to make sure that women can have a life outside of that and that people in general don’t have o conform to such rigid social restrictions. 

You wanna be a housewife and stay at home cleaning and cooking and go to church on Sunday be my guest. But just don’t expect everyone else to want to do the same that’s all."
341,"Nah, if you personally like tradition, and it’s your own choice to like it as a woman, uninfluenced by the will/expectations of others— then it’s totally fine. But far too often, tradition is about controlling and restricting women. Which is what a “submissive” and “obedient” wife usually is. Nothing more than a possession or butler. 

It’s really just all about freedom and a woman choosing her own life for herself. 

If a woman wants all that for herself truly, and it’s her own choice, and isn’t pressured by religious guilt or social norms, then I see nothing wrong with it. The whole point is that women can live how they want, by their own autonomy and choice. So if a woman is fulfilled and happy living a traditional life, and she’s not hurting from it, and it’s not forced on her, it’s whatever. I don’t know how often that would truly be the case though. The problem comes when people spread the message that all women have to be that way, or that it’s a woman’s sole place or reason for existing (like Girl Defined)."
342,"So if a shy man got into a relationship with a woman who wanted him to be obedient, would you say the same? Secondly, your statement makes feminism seem like it's trying to shape what relationships should be and limit what people should prefer. Could you explain so maybe I could get a better understanding?"
343,"I mean, feel free to beat it, then. There's the door. No one's stopping you."
344,"I don't personally have a problem with it, but I just don't think it's necessary to try to change it completely. That would of course turn into the opposite, where instead of shaming for being independant, we'd be shaming for wanting to be a stay at home mom for example. I've been shamed for wanting to be a housewife, but I've never seen anyone shamed for being an independant woman. Mostly because that's the new normal and everyone accepts that. I just don't understand what feminism is still fighting for it really feels like we've and chives equality already if not going too far off a cliff. I don't mean to offend anyone"
345,Why are you conflating being shy with being submissive or timid? Nothing is wrong with the former and it has nothing to do with gender issues. The latter can open you up to a lot of abuse or mistreatment and it's something that is historically and presently expected of women.
346,"Yes, as I said in my first comment ""Any person who expects another person to be obedient to them"" sounds controlling and abusive of their power.


And yes, feminism does want to reduce abusive relationships, I feel good about that statement."
347,"why are you confusing being introverted with being sumbissive or obedient.  I am incredibly introverted, I am the furthest thing from obedient"
348,Or I can express my opinion reply to o p not you
349,women face incredible hardship trying to establish themselves as independent persons in society. Seeing how women are treated in STEM fields is a prime example of that. But i kinda think I’m wasting my time here since you’re the kind of person who posts in r/anti feminist so I doubt you’re here to learn much
350,"Yeah. My mom is the shiest person I know; she doesn't make eye contact with or talk to strangers. But she is also the bossiest person I know, and her former colleagues confirmed my suspicion that she is indeed an extremely bossy person. I have no idea why anyone would conflate shy, timid, and  submissive. They are each very different."
351,Not talking shit on our sub you can't.
352,Sweetie no one is talking s***. It's deeply concerning that no one is allowed to express an opinion that is not exactly the same as yours and it kind of is proving my point
353,"> the issue is the group you posted this in. People in this group do not care about women who are different than they are

Anyway, since you don't seem to want to find the door yourself even though we're all so awful, I'll be happy to show you to it."
354,"It's ridiculous. In the case that your life is threatened, it's always acceptable to use self-defense regardless of gender for incredibly obvious reasons. Otherwise, it's never ok for anyone of any gender to strike anyone else of any gender."
355,"I find it disturbing how many men fantasize about beating the shit out of women.

>a man striking a woman in self defense

That's not what self-defense means. Retaliation is not defense."
356,"If we are talking about self-defense in the sense any reputable self-defense instructor means it - i.e. the minimum necessary force to get you out of a dangerous situation - I don’t see why we would call it a fight.  It’s perfectly okay to do, but I don’t call self-defense a fight.  

Generally I have seen this expression used to justify why it is okay to knock a woman out if she pokes a man in the chest and, no, that isn’t what self-defense is.  If a man did that to another man, he’d likely be found guilty of assault, not ‘self-defense’."
357,"The term is actually ""Equal Rights, Equal Lefts"". And this question is just as stupid and baiting as all your other questions. 

No one should hit anyone unless they are physically in danger... and then they should only do what is required to get out of the dangerous situation. Knocking a woman unconscious because she slapped you does not qualify."
358,I love (no) how one of the first thing men try to gain with equality is the right to hit women
359,"Self-defense is one thing. Feeling the need to come up with and share a catch-phrase that outlines your 'right' to hit someone else? You've got some other problems and no, you aren't entitled to physically abuse anyone.

Like the idea that physical abuse or violence against any person is 'only' intolerable if they don't have full civil rights is literally sickening, pathological, and deeply disturbing."
360,"I think striking another person is stupid when you can walk away

Men can almost always walk away"
361,"I think it’s a great excuse for men to hit women - men who have higher muscle mass and strength and can inflict a lot more damage. There is no defence for striking another person, no matter who struck first."
362,Why are these men a) so eager to beat women and b) deluded that men haven't been beating women all along?
363,[removed]
364,"And, of course, self-defense is not retaliation. It is the minimum amount of force needed to deescalate or leave."
365,"Furthermore, it seems to imply that undergoing physical violence is a tradeoff for equal rights. And I'm pretty sure that's not a thing."
366,"Have you ever seen a much smaller guy being physically aggressive with a much larger guy? A situation where the larger guy is trying to desescalate but isn't running away? And the the smaller guy jabs him or throws a punch and gets knocked down/out? I have never, ever heard anyone, man or woman, say the smaller guy didn't have it coming. So whats the difference?

The self defense I have done is all based on street fighting. You don't know if the other person has a weapon, has friends behind you or has training. Your goal is to disable them as quickly and efficiently as possible. That means at the very least temporary, if not incidentally semi-permanent, harm. The initial goal is always to deescalate, but be prepared. Whoever makes things physical, by actually striking, cornering, or aggressively closing to striking distance on the other person is the one responsible for what follows. Fighting is not a joke. Falling and striking your head can lead to permanent damage or death. Those are the potential consequences.  
I believe women don't take this seriously because they don't understand when they personally threaten someone else's space (though they are very aware in the reversal). Some of them are used to being physically aggressive with men and getting away with it. If a man pokes another mans chest you bet your ass he's going to get a knock out punch. A chest poke is an extremely aggressive physical move between people who aren't in friendly mode. 

Like I said, deescalation is always the #1 choice, and that includes removing ones self from the situation. The amount of victim blaming, and excusing women's physically aggressive behavior in this thread looks pretty bad. The top voted comment in 'ask feminists' is usually spot on and pretty great, the number of comments following promoting double standards and excuses for bad behavior is always sad to see, especially when they are up voted."
367,"Right? Like, is it really that hard to never hit a woman? Idk, I'm of the opinion that hitting women is always wrong, can't think of a scenario when you'd need to. Woman hits you? Leave and form a legal response. Woman attacks you using a weapon? What's hitting going to do?"
368,"It's in the context of self defense, not wife beating. Under that condition would you consider it being ok for men using self defense against women?"
369,"Personally I've been in situations where I couldn't walk away and many of my friends have also been in that situation. To get out of it I didn't scream at the person, or push, or hit back; I like many other men just took it. Men can't always walk away, same with women."
370,And presumably have two legs to walk away...
371,"Please respect our top-level comment rule, which requires that all direct replies to questions posted to AskFeminists must come from feminists and must reflect a feminist perspective. Comment removed; this is your only warning."
372,"> I have never, ever heard anyone, man or woman, say the smaller guy didn't have it coming. 

Well let me be the first one you hear it from: poking someone should not lead to getting knocked out. That is a major overreaction.

You can now fix it to, ""Only one person has said that they didn't have it coming."""
373,"Oh I absolutely have seen a guy get into quite a bit of trouble - as in arrest and conviction for assault - for knocking out another guy who poked his chest, and no the guy poking did not have it coming.  That is never okay to do, and stop normalizing the idea that anyone, man or woman, ‘has it coming’."
374,"That’s a bit of a ridiculous claim.

There are so many variables that your claim isn’t really valid at all. You just assume in all situations a weapons user is actually fully competent with that weapons, but that is like saying everyone had special forces training and is a stone cold killer machine. In most cases your attacker won’t be highly competent at wielding any type of weapon, especially especially in domestic situations.

You also ignore what actually falls under „weapons.“
Firearms, anything then can be used to stab or cause blunt trauma. A lot of weapons don’t cause immediate death or immediately render someone unable to defend themselves as they require repeated attacks to do so. 

This is again true especially for domestic cases where people don’t regularly engage each other with military grade weapons with massive stopping power.

If a woman tries to use a pan to smash your skull you probably won’t die instantly and I am pretty much doubting you would just lie down and patiently wait to get beaten to death by her.

Leaving is also not always as easy as simply walking away. If said women is determined enough to mess you up, she may follow. You just assume everyone is able to run faster than all women or able to actually run at all. I assume you know people with medical conditions, disabilities or simply old people exist, ey?

I mean come one. I am a dude who never even hit anyone yet and luckily never had to as I am good at walking away from violence, but thinking of a couple reasonable situations didn’t really require any prolonged and intense thinking.

„Never“ is a pretty absolute word that is rarely applicable when talking about human interactions.
Please reconsider its use."
375,You already have the right to self-defense. Retaliation is not defense.
376,"See that’s the trick. Self defense situation doesn’t matter if it’s a woman or a man. It’s self defense. 

But it’s ok, you were simply asking if you could legally hit women in a fantasized scenario"
377,Nothing about that catch-phrase implies it's about self-defense.
378,"Much of the time men and women can both walk away, they just don't realize it. We need to do a better job teaching young people to see the signs of impending violence early and walk away before things get to that point.

I say that as someone who has survived two attempted murders and looking back can see that I did actually have the opportunity to walk away, both times. But I was young and hadn't been taught. 

For example, never have an argument in a bathroom. They generally only have one exit and have many things that can become a weapon. 

There are ways to safely get around someone blocking an exit without hurting them, even if they're somewhat bigger than you. If they're significantly bigger, that's harder

And these days, calling 911 is always an option that is better than getting beat. 911 didn't exist when I was surviving violence."
379,Why do you and your friends get in so many fights?
380,Make that two.
381,"Legal isn't necessarily what keeps you safe. I'm speaking as someone who got jumped by 4 skinheads. One of which jammed a finger in my chest and started shit talking, then pushed me so another could take a running punch at me from the side. To which 3 of them kicked me on the ground while a fourth pulled a knife on my friends. How many times have you been jumped or attacked by people you don't know?  


edit - the guy they sent to start shit with me was the smallest of them. They also waiting til i put down my beer bottle to initiate"
382,"Sir, I think you're mistaken. I wouldn't hit a woman who attacked me with a weapon because my fists aren't going to do much to someone who's armed. That's why I'm armed most of the time I go out. If anyone, man or woman attacks or threatens me with a weapon they're not getting hit, if you get me. I don't carry a gun because I'm not comfortable doing so, but I start with the pepper spray and escalate to the knife. Fists ain't gonna cut it."
383,"I'm not sure how that helps anyone here.

If you are a guy, you have to accept that aggressive knucklehead guys are going to get in your face to start something regardless of how pacifist you are.

The OP is clearly not getting into fights - he is clearly trying to avoid them, so why are you insinuating he's to blame?"
384,"Dude, you are talking about a very different scenario than a one on one situation with no weapons.  A person knocks you out for getting in their face and poking them and damn right I am telling any police that get called that the person was not acting in self defense and went way too far, and I would let you know I will stand witness if you press charges.  

Self defense is the minimum needed force to be safe.  If you use disproportionate violence that is no longer self defense.   The force needed for four people who have weapons is not the same for a single unarmed person.  

As for the question, does it make it somehow less dangerous if the person attacking is someone you know?  Can’t say I have been jumped by strangers but have been attacked by known persons in my own home so..."
385,I think you are mistaken if you think everyone on the planet is armed most of their time. You being armed or shooting your attacker doesn’t invalidate any point I made.
386,"The point is you don't know they are the only person. You can't assume you know the entire situation of what is going down just because of whats in front of you. Your concern is your safety, not the law. Hence you should back up and deescalate. If they invade your space you defend yourself.  'Minimum force' is temporarily disabling someone as fast as possible. You don't hit people on the ground or anything stupid like that. You hit vulnerable areas hard. Poking eyes, kicking crotches, punching throats, kneeing faces, elbowing jaws and stomping feet are all acceptable. It takes different amounts for force to stop different people. It's also is something you can't risk underestimating."
387,"I mean, you can try to hit the next woman who comes at you with a frying pan and see how it goes. I imagine it's going to end in quite a few traumatic pan injuries and two broken hands. Or you can engage with the same tactic she's using, environmental weapons. The key phrase is, ""never bring a knife to a gunfight."""
388,"Not even what I suggested. Derail much?

I simply suggested not being a defeatist if you have to fight and happen to not be armed like you or able to run away. Maybe you could make a point on something I actually said or just put your ego aside and realize I made a multitude of valid points and your absolutist „never“ is actually not applicable at all. Just a suggestion, ey?


PS: in your mind every woman seems to be hyper competent at using pans as a weapons. Ever considered they might simply miss their first swing and you can land a hit before their second? Does this seem 100% impossible to you? Cause that’s what „never“ actually means. 
A pan was also just an example. Maybe don’t pretend to be stupid in trying to flip this around now?"
389,Dog if she misses you with the pan why not just leave?
390,"Read first comment. I stated multiple reasons why this might not be possible for everyone. It is probably for me, but that wasn’t the point."
391,Yes. People with a gender are overwhelmingly responsible for rape.
392,"I think yes, to a certain extent. its true anyone can be raped, but women are more at risk, and men make up the majority of the perpetrators, whether they attack men or women. so i wouldn't necessarily say rape is a gendered issue, but gender needs to be taken into account."
393,"Yes. Gender is relevant to the likehood of being perpetrator or victim of rape, the circumstances in which it takes place, and the after effects."
394,It's certainly gendered in the sense that most perpetrators are men and most victims are women. That doesn't mean victims of either gender should be ignored.

409,"I have to say I am not sure if that. For my part I have been raped by a man and a woman at different points in my life. Both the same setting, both the same outcome: a metric tonne of PTSD.

Getting raped can happen to everyone so that literally cannot be a gendered issue. Yes women are more at risk for sure but lots of gay men experience something similar and even some straight men at the hands of their friends or partners. 

And being a rapist is hardly gendered as well. It’s not like men have the inherent wish or urge to rape people - neither have women. 

Personally I think it’s a patriarchy issue. Because men are taught to get whatever they want, and women are supposed to be timid, submissive and not enjoying it all that much."
410,"I take people at their word a lot

412,"In my field women are bullied and harassed until they quit or sometimes die. One reason this happens is because less than 4% of workers are women. Women in leadership positions are even more uncommon.

Quotas would help, and in order to get certain contracts, there are quotas, but mostly it's a lot like the wild West"
413,"In particular circumstances, yes. They are a tool to help overcome the structural disadvantages one gender has in a particular field (usually women)."
414,"I do believe in quotas and other incentives for diversity, and it’s because of a common misconception that you repeat in your post. It’s not that I think women can’t earn these positions, it’s that I think they are absolutely qualified but employers won’t give them these positions due to implicit bias and societal factors. I think it’s really important to look at intersectionality in hiring as well - that implicit bias is even stronger when women are BIPOC, queer, low socioeconomic status, disabled, etc.. 

Many hiring practices are no longer explicitly bias but they have bias results because they are bias in their implementation. Any incentive to increase the number of women and GNC folks is positive for me. I would like for there to not need to be a quota/extra incentive, but that’s not the world we live in right now.

Another consideration though is that a quota isn’t necessarily appropriate in all scenarios. Examples would be that I think there should be incentives for more women going into trades/trade schools, but I’m not sure if a quota is the most appropriate for that given I think the issue with trades IIRC is that not a lot of women are applying rather than women are being turned away. I think more comprehensive cultural and behavioral initiatives to get women interested have to happen in and outside of those fields."

425,"That's not really how those words are used? Also this isn't just about who gets a job, but who gets positions of power. Men get all the high paying, powerful jobs, and that's a problem, creating a power- and economic imbalance.

Of course it's not quite so easy as ""men come in, and suddenly it's a well paid, prestigious job"", but more that these three things play into each other: more prestige, more money, more men - but it shows that women aren't avoiding these fields for a lack of interest. 

Teaching is another example where men tend to hold the more prestigious jobs despite the clear interest from women in the profession."
436,"No, I did not. Your example is just so far removed from reality that it could never possibly play out this way.

Plus, you seem to turn all my maybe's into absolutes, so of course nothing makes sense this way. This isn't a constructive discussion."
437,You may want to look at the research on what happened to salaries to biological research fields when it became more woman-dominated.
438,Honestly that’s because programming was a completely different thing in the beginning. It became more complicated & lucrative over the years. Causation VS Correlation.
439,"Anecdotal evidence is what I especially said I don't want.

I wanted a source that shows that not supply and demand are responsible for the increase in the payment of a job, but just because more men then women work there. 

> Jobs often become higher paying *because* men choose to do them 

Since you claimed that.

> more prestige, more money, more men - but it shows that women aren't avoiding these fields for a lack of interest. 

How does it show that? Since you did not use any data (for example male-female ratio) to show that a lack of interests is not at fault here.   
  

If I did not misunderstand you, then the hypothesis:  

""more prestige => more money => more men ""

Could only mean that more men are applying then women."
440,"My example was as far removed from reality as job Feild paying less for the sole reason of such field being female dominated.

I do recognize this is a constructive discussion which I appreciate because alot of times when I take interest into the reason behind Feminist ideas I'm offer met with personal attacks."
441,your statement sort of implies that either men took over because it became more complicated or that it became more lucrative because men took over

Saying «I don’t owe women anything» to me sounds like you don’t care about womens struggles and you don’t want to work towards improving anything. That’s their problem and I don’t owe them anything. It comes off asshole-ish. It depends on context of course, but isolated this sentence doesnt make you sound good."
454,"Ok, I'm really not sure about the terminology, so probably I will get it wrong. I believe that the post refer to reparative feminism (I hope it's the correct term), which states that men owe women reparations for how they were treated in the past (so, not for the single cases but as a group).

I heard this position before, I don't know how it is considered in the feminist movement, tbh, however I think that's what OP was referring to."

These are exactly the types of bullshit attitudes that feminists want to eliminate. 

Does that make sense?"
459,"Well I would argue that ‘protection’ is context based. I certainly feel I owe people around me protection in certain circumstances, as part of living in a society together. As a woman I also open doors for others as I see it as being polite.

Three reasons. One, this will be seen as an unfortunate interlude before returning back to the way things should work, and the important stuff ($$$). Second, because male heroes will be noticed disproportionately often & male fuck-ups will be given a pass. Three, because ""heroes"" don't actually get supported very well.

479,"Well, birth control could fail, could discover a family disease the person really doesn’t want to pass on (fatal familial insomnia sounds pretty terrible), a cancer diagnosis and a pregnancy would make treatment impossible, etc.  In that world abortion would be pretty rare, sure, but I don’t see why one would ban it."
480,"Pregnancy complications, birth control failure, wanting to continue her education/career, not wanting to have children, not wanting to be stuck with the father, wanting to be able to provide more attention to the child(ren) she already has, environmental concerns, concerns about stress on her relationships..."
481,"Being pregnant and giving birth are very painful and physically strenuous. Some people just don’t want to go thru that, some people want to live without the physical impacts of a pregnancy"
482,"I have free healthcare, I have and use birth control and my country offers at least a year of maternity leave. None of that changes the fact that if I still ended up pregnant I would get an abortion because I would rather die then go through pregnancy and childbirth."
483,There are health reasons
484,"I’m a trans guy, and personally, pregnancy would be a living nightmare and culmination of my gender dysphoria. So I would absolutely still need access to abortion services.

(Not all trans people capable of pregnancy feel this way, and that’s perfectly ok, but it is NOT for me.)"
485,"There are two reasons a woman doesn't have children: because she can't, or because she doesn't want them. Either way, it's none of your business."
486,"Because some women have aspriations outside the home and don't desire to be a baby making machine just because they will be well cared for. That sounds a lot like treating women like cattle, or brood mares. That women aren't allowed to or that you believe they just don't have personal drive, ambition, or passion.

Some women might be happy with your arrangement, and there's nothing wrong with those that choose that, but suggesting all women should just accept being forced to birth children if they get pregnant is insanity. Plus I can't imagine all the health risks, defects, and deaths forcing so many women to carry a pregnancy would cause. You have no idea what pregnancy really looks like do you? There are like a thousand health risks and possible developments that can happen to the female body during pregnancy. It can be really awful. People who assume pregnancy is just this simple nine month process are so naive and put of touch."
487,"The fetus may have an abnormality that means it will be delivered stillborn, or not live long after birth. The trauma of carrying a pregnancy for *months* knowing you will just have to bury your baby - not to mention the physical and financial cost of medical care + burial- is too much for a woman and her family to bear."
488,"That’s a hell of an “if” you’ve got there...

Here’s the thing about having kids: It pretty much eats your life. If you’ve ever spoken with anyone who had a child, you already know that. If you have a child, that’s very much all you do for the next 10 years, and at the center of everything you do for the subsequent 10+. 

Not a single person I’ve ever talked to thought that people shouldn’t have a choice about, for example, whether they brush their teeth for the recommended time each day—which takes less time than you’ll spend reading this thread. Nobody I’ve ever met thought they should get to say whether someone else has to work at a daycare, where they can go home at the end of each day and never once deal with a screaming child for 5 hours in the middle of the night. We can all agree that people can assess whether those are things they personally want to commit to. But we’re somehow all competent to assess whether someone else should have to be responsible for other living human beings 24/7?

Another, related issue: Raising children is fucking hard when you like it and sign up for it intentionally. When you don’t like it and didn’t sign up for it? Well, talk to a CPS person or a social worker sometime, if you have the guts. This is one situation where it’s highly beneficial for all involved to believe people when they say they can’t do it. I know we love to glom onto the heartwarming stories of people who thought they didn’t want kids, but one glance at that special baby, and they fell in love and all their problems just evaporated. That... doesn’t really happen a lot in meatspace. And it’s a hell of a gamble to take, that a person who states they can’t take care of an infant is actually perfectly positioned to do it, and just doesn’t know it yet. 

Think about what makes you think that anyone who has a working uterus really just wants to raise babies, and the only thing stopping them is money. Is that what you want? (If yes, there’s a quarter million+ kids in foster care in the U.S., and similarly insurmountable numbers in most other countries that publish those kinds of stats.) Is that what every woman you know wants? What about the men? 

I’m ready to go out of my mind being stuck in my house all day right now, and I still have that career that I love and that I’m awesome at, and nobody screams at me or wakes me up at night ever. How long would I last if I had to take care of anyone who isn’t big enough to clean up after themselves and hold down a conversation and wipe their own butt, and someone thought telling me to stay home till said person was in _high school_ was doing me a favor? I’m really glad for all involved that we never have to find out."
489,Because that's not a choice. Without the choice of abortion one is having their right to self-determination removed. What if you don't want to stay home? What if you don't feel emotionally mature enough or have the right emotional support for a child... health reasons so many.
490,"Although addressing the economic challenges that unplanned parenthood often brings is one portion of the equation in reducing ""need"" for abortions, the truth is the majority of people who have abortions are people who have children already and don't want more-- and not because they can't afford more-- but because raising children is hard, it's a lot of work, and it takes time and energy from the parents-- not just their 'productive' time (ie time they have to spend working to afford children) but also their emotional and mental time-- and lots of parents feel like they don't want to split that time between more children.

Additionally, even if all the economic circumstances were addressed, there will be some people who don't want to be parents, either at all, or simply don't want to be bio parents re: carrying a pregnancy to term-- and there could be a huge variety of reasons for this-- it could be a health issue with the pregnancy, it could be a health risk for the potential pregnant person. So many factors exist that this 'solution' wouldn't eliminate the need or desire for accessible abortion."

493,"The ""no concerns about money until the kid graduated from high school"" line was just a lazy way to say, ""She is free to pursue whatever she wants and is fully supported in doing so without needing a man or partner so that financial considerations needn't matter at all in the decision to terminate the pregnancy."""
494,Birth control can fail and a pregnancy can go unoticed so long that other methods would fail also.
495,"The notion of ""abortion as birth control"" is a boogeyman. People aren't out having totally unprotected sex and then having multiple abortions every time they get pregnant because they can't be bothered to use a condom or take a pill or whatever. Abortion is not a walk in the park and depending on where you are and your situation, it may be very difficult or impossible to obtain. You can't just run down to the Walgreen's for a quick aborsh any time you accidentally get pregnant."
496,Abortion is always birth control. Why is that a problem?
497,"It is logical, isn't it? If you do not want to have a child and your birth control fails, it is only logical to choose to get an abortion as your ""back up"" birth control. 

Nice to know we're on the same page!"
498,"I like how you replied to the only answer that you can use against feminists.

Shows how extremely unbiased you are."

I created so many prefaces to the question to acknowledge that until all of those things are fixed about a broken patriarchal based system, it's all a moot point, but could a society be created where having an abortion just wouldn't make sense?  And I'm learning a lot from the answers. Thanks for indulging my ignorance; I know it's not your job."
502,"Well, to be specific, backup birth control for when other contingencies fail."

Yes, a world where the birth control is safe, universal for men and women alike, and absolute — never fails."

505,"The definition that I learnt at school and that I still stand by is that Feminism is the recognition that women as a group are disadvantaged in society and that action needs to be taken to change this.

Feminism is a very broad movement with a lot of different strands of thought within it so there are many different definitions and approaches that can l be correct at the same time."
506,"Feminism is a movement to achieve equality with men for women. By dismantling the concept of fixed gender roles and patriarchal expectations, both men and women are served; however, the focus is on women and women's issues. Many feminists are also interested in men's issues."

If you are trying to get anything tangible accomplished, it helps to focus.  Feminist groups tend to focus on issues predominantly facing women.  There are groups, like the Innocence Project,  started by feminists that focus on issues predominantly facing men."
512,"Well, I'm not the original responder but my answer is because the economic, cultural and societal rules of most regions greatly favor men already. If you would take the time to educate yourself on the history of feminism by reading one of the many, many books, articles, blogs etc on the topic, you could see how this is demonstrated as there are countless examples. 

It seems from the way you're wording your questions that what you're really attempting to do is not to understand feminism but rather to argue against it. If that is not your intention, again I ask you to take it upon yourself to learn about this very well documented topic rather than ask feminists to explain to you what has been throughly proven before.  If you have Reddit, you have Google. Use it. Learn what feminism is. Read what others have already researched. There's a lot of information available to you."

518,"Are the female characters all romantically interested in/trying to get with the male protagonist? If they're not, then it's not a ""harem"" story. It's just a story with a lot of women in it.

Let the female characters be people. Let them have lives and interests that don't revolve around the main character (or men in general). Let them be diverse in terms of characterization, too - don't just make ""female"" their main personality trait. Focus more on who they are than how they look. 

In other words, treat them like regular characters... who happen to be female."
519,This reminds me of a funny story: i once dm'd a DnD games were i used gender neutral names and never used gendered pronouns for NPC's. Nobody even noticed.

521,"I guess the takeaway is that gender almost never matters in ""regular"" adventure, sci-fi or fantasy stories. So i guess unless you are trying to make a specific point about a gendered issue there is not much reason why to writen characters of different genders (or nb characters) differently. It doesn't come up that often."
522,"Of course they would be better off. Overall. There would be (and is!) that sense of ""aggrieved entitlement"" when privileges are eroded, but the truth is they're losing something they never deserved to begin with. Patriarchy constricts individualist expression via strict gender expectations. It *does* primarily hurt women due to the inherent subjugation of the feminine in a patriarchal structure, but men are hurt by it as well, and men and women both can and do participate in it."
523,"You can reframe the question concerning slavery. Slavery benefitted a lot of people. Is their life worse without the privilege of having slaves? Is general society worse off? Even if the answer is yes in some areas, it was abandoned because it's unjust and cruel. We decided to follow human rights (ok, USA didn't) and smashing patriarchy is basically consequently following human rights (again: bad call for US citizens)."
524,"You may want to look at the post right before this one - OP had a good insight.  While yes, in a patriarchy men overall get privileged above women all other things being equal, this doesn’t mean that every or even most men are benefiting all that much from patriarchy.  Men who don’t meet the ‘patriarchal ideal’ don’t have so great a time of it.  While the ‘men’s self improvement’ industry may take men’s money to convince them if they just take the right individual actions, they can finally meet that ideal and be successful’ it doesn’t work out that way.  

Without a patriarchy, there is no more patriarchal ideal men have to meet that seems to lead to a lot of insecurity and paranoia that I can’t imagine being too fun.  Yeah, the men that are succeeding under patriarchy may lose out but for most men, it’s a complete net win.  

As for if under patriarchy there are benefits women have...I mean sure, the women who are closely connected to the men who succeed under patriarchy and who are useful to keeping it going get some benefits along with the downsides, but again, that is hardly most women."
525,"I mean, *everyone* would be better off in a world without patriarchy, so ..."
526,"> Is patriarchy's purpose to benefit men at the expense of women?

yes.

> Is taking away men's privileges a part of smashing patriarchy?

a lot of the privileges men have are not really ""privileges"" so much as rights or basic expectations women should also be able to take for granted, so no.

> If patriarchy benefits men, how is it possible it also harms men at the same time? 

you could ask this about any system of power that has ever existed."
527,[removed]
528,No and deep down every man knows this.
529,"Yeah, I really like looking at modern feminism through racial analogy because it works really well for my weird brain, but this is where it breaks. The patriarchy would be wrong even if it only hurt women, but it doesn't. It primarily hurts women, but it also hurts men. Slavery and white power structures really just benefit whites, the only white people you could justify them hurting is white women (look up the KKK rapes, the KKK loves talking about defending the purity of white women but they used to conduct regular terrorist attacks where they raped white women who came to the South to teach blacks to read).

Edit: *Europe, following human rights? It's less likely than you think...*"
530,"I don't think thats that great of a comparison since the privilege to own slave doesn't enforce so much pressure on slave owners like the patriarchy does. Maybe if we include the fact that non-slave owners are pressured to participate in the slaver mindset or even slight disagreement with the fact that owning slaves is moral it could work. 

Same as with slave owning scocieties in history i would argue that most men in the current world don't really benefit from patriarchy not even economicly."
531,Well there are people that make money from patriarchy for example but for huge parts of both women and men they don't benefit.

It might be a stretch but I think, many men might agree that benefitting from others being oppressed is wrong and should therefore be abolished."
536,"Ah. So women are equally represented in government, military and justice departments? Men are encouraged to express their emotions and seek help for their mental health? Men aren't shamed for displaying any ""feminine"" behaviours or preferences?

543,"Short answer: yes, that is exactly what feminism hopes to do. You are on the right track!

Edited to add: you might want to look up “kyriarchy,” because it refers to all of these other contributing things you mentioned."
544,"I’ll have a crack at answering this, but I will admit your Q is a bit confusing by differentiating masculinity from sex/gender when masculinity/masculine is a category within spectrums of sex/gender. 

Patriarchy is an infrastructure of power/social system that privileges narrowly defined masculinity and masculine traits over that which is not within this narrow definition of masculinity. The promotion and maintenance of these masculine traits in power requires the constant reinforcement that not-masculine things across the gender spectrum are weaker/less valuable. Therefore patriarchy isn’t based on masculinity alone as masculinity needs categories to be ‘better than’ (in patriarchal ideology) or to ‘serve masculinity’ in order for power to function. That category is typical feminine, but it can also be ‘not masculine enough’ - but what defines something as not masculine enough is usually related to some kind of feminisation (e.g. hurdur short man is weak like woman). 

It is more realistic to say patriarchy is rooted in sex/gender sociopolitics because patriarchy has implications for all people, including women and men who don’t fit a narrow definition of masculinity. 

So to try and answer your Q - you can’t have a concept of masculinity without a concepts of sex/gender, so Patriarchy is a sex/gender based system that privileges particular definitions of masculinity (aggressive, unflinching, tall CEOs etc). Just having a penis in patriarchy doesn’t necessarily afford you power. (But it helps!)"
545,"This is such a good response that I've been refuting points I was going to ask about just by rereading.

I guess I would ask one, how can/how does feminism help create a system where forms deemed not masculine enough or too feminine can be on a level of privilege equal to CEO-traits dude?

How can I help? Feels like a cause worth fighting for."
546,">I guess I would ask one, how can/how does feminism help create a system where forms deemed not masculine enough or too feminine can be on a level of privilege equal to CEO-traits dude?

Well that's where feminism and smashing the patriarchy starts to bleed into dismantling capitalism.  Capitalism is inherently tied to the patriarchy. It effectively only values the extreme ""masculine"" characteristics like competitiveness and dominance, and rewards people and corporations for eliminating their humanity. 

At some point society needs to realize:

1. Work life balance is critical to a healthy society. Men may dominate the boardroom and almost all leadership roles, but they also dominate suicides homelessness. 
2. Endless consumption is unsustainable. We have one planet and it does not give a shit if our fragile, fleeting species is snuffed out forever. 
3. No human should ever go without food, shelter, education or medical care.  
4. Anything over $1B in net worth/profit (individuals or corporations) should be taxed at like... 90%. Thus forcing people and corporations to reinvest instead of hoarding it away. 

COVID-19 is going to teach us some tough lessons. Hopefully we learn from them."
547,"I’m so glad it made sense to you. Forgive the terrible editing, I’m typing one handed on a phone   due to a broken wrist. I think asking ‘how do we change things when the system works to devalue and oppress us’ is THE question of feminism really, and there isn’t an easy answer. Another commenter has described the macro project of dismantling capitalist patriarchy, so I thought I’d share a few things I do to promote feminism in my daily life:

- Question misogyny, even if it’s small and fleeting! When I hear misogynistic terms like ‘bitch’ or ‘slut’ in general conversation, I’ll often ask if the person would use the same terms if they were talking about a man and if they use those terms to talk about women regularly. I ask if they appreciate the misogynistic connotations of the words, and if they do why they are comfortable using misogynistic language. 

- Fight for proactive gender inclusion! If you work in any environment that needs team building, push for always having 50% women involved in a project. If this is questioned, call it out!!! I was once in a meeting with a consultant regarding building a project team. I insisted the team be half women. The consultant (a white man, unsurprisingly) resisted ‘we need to recruit based on TALENT not gender targets!’ So I looked him dead in the eye and asked if he was a sexist person who equated talent with being a man, seeing as he seemed to be suggesting that it would be easier to find talented men than talented women. He obviously denied that was the point he was making. So I said something like ‘well if we agree that talent isn’t something only men possess, then let’s proceed with a talented, gender balanced team.’ Which we did. 

- Campaign for equal pay. Campaign for recognition of the essential contribution many give to society via low paid, under appreciated jobs traditionally understood as ‘women’s work’ - nurses, teachers, cleaners etc. Why does a registered nurse who has a degree and literally saves lives on a daily basis earn~£25K when a trainee firefighter earns nearer £30K before being fully qualified? Because one is feminised work and other masculine? I really hope the COVID-19 crisis marks a shift in recognising the gender inequality of these public service roles (but i wouldn’t count on it). 

- IF they maintain feminist values, vocally and financially support businesses run by women, women leaders in the workplace, women creatives, women in politics etc. It’s a hard truth that women existing in these places face undue criticism if they are anything other than exceptional. Make that point when people question women in power. I’m not saying all women are exceptional leaders, just that they aren’t permitted to make mistakes without it being equated to their womenhood, and that is BS. 

- Encourage feminist approaches to raising children. No more ‘boys will be boys’! No more ‘girls love pink!’ etc. They’re are lots of campaigns that have more detailed guidance on this, and we are seeing progress (and demand!) for this via examples like the incredible popularity of ‘Good Night Stories For Rebel Girls’ books.

For me, a long term goal of feminism is to break the binary that equates hyper masculine traits with powerful/strong and traditionally feminine traits with soft/weak. You only need to examine these things for a few minutes to see how ludicrous it is that these hierarchies exist. Why on Earth is emotional intelligence a weakness? Why is stubbornness a supposed strength? As Betty White said ‘Why do people say ""grow some balls""? Balls are weak and sensitive. If you wanna be tough, grow a vagina. Those things can take a pounding.’ I’d like us to view the present very gendered spectrum of personality traits and physical traits more like a colour spectrum. You can’t say ‘Red is bad and Green is good!’ Like with colours, there’s appropriate context and preferences relevant to most behaviours.

On a good note, I see valuable progress in the younger generations who look up to female  leaders such as Malala and Greta Thunberg - young women who have spoken truth to power and made an enormous cultural impact without any the masculine traits older generations expect from leaders. I believe these shifting values will be reflected in the households, boardrooms and governments of the future - although there is still a long way to go!"
548,"My country's response to this has almost made me want to move. I applaud our healthcare workers toiling their butts off and putting their lives on the line for ours.

Our government has its head up its own ass but there's legitimate heroes in America and I hope we come out of this stronger than we were, like you said. 

If feminism can help us out of this clownshow way of running a nation then I'm all for it."
549,"I think there are a couple arguments to be made.

One is that this may look bad to outsiders. Science funding is tight, and if you're in the US, trust in science is slipping. We need to avoid situations that look questionable. Part of that is being professional, and keeping any ""inside jokes"" free of any racist or sexist connotations. Consider the case of a gene in fruit flies that was named after Sonic the Hedgehog, because it caused a phenotype that ... made fruit flies sort of look like Sonic the Hedgehog. (Sort of.) I think that's arguably a better reason and a better name than ""sugar daddy."" Then the gene was linked to a serious medical condition, and doctors got to explain to heartbroken parents that their child was suffering/dying because of a gene named after Sonic the Hedgehog. Not funny, and it was awkward all around. In science, you don't know what's going to become important or fall into the public eye, and if your research ""pops"" you don't want to spend any time explaining or trying not to say things people will turn into memes. (I'm sure there are some journal reflections on the sonic the hedgehog gene, but I'll link you this NYT article instead because I'm almost finished with lunch:  [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/weekinreview/12schwartz.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/weekinreview/12schwartz.html) )

Another aspect of this issue is that it may be microaggression-y for women in the field. Any jokes \*ever\* get made about ""your sugar daddy \[results\]"" or whatever? Are those jokes going to feel the same to men and women? Will HR find those jokes funny? Will they seem the same to undergraduate/graduate students you're trying to mentor? Does the use of the term reflect the kind of workplace you want to foster? Here's a paper suggesting that the men in charge may not ""see"" the problem while women could:  [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.857.4536&rep=rep1&type=pdf](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.857.4536&rep=rep1&type=pdf) 

I think there's also an argument that while the name may not offend, the fact that everyone's ok with it signals something, and that's not great. (This is kind of where I personally fall - I'm not personally offended but if I was working with a group, and it was a term they came up with, I'd wonder if that was their sense of humor, and if it was a sign that there were more issues to be uncovered.)

Finally, and this is probably the argument I'd lead with, if the name doesn't actually fit the variable or assay, then it's kind of a sucky name, and it should be renamed sooner rather than later to avoid a generation divide. Are there alternatives that are more evocative of the kind of work you're actually doing?"
550,"Kinda related but the terminology of ""master/slave"", widely popular in technology, is being replaced (not without a fight from chuds, racists and anti  SJW ofcourse) by alternatives.

551,"Unless it has something to do with sugar, I don't see any reason to not rename it. 2006 is not really a long history to unlearn it.

I personally am quite indifferent about it but I see your point. Especially in male dominated fields, there usually isn't only one ""misstep"" like this. ""Constant dripping wears the stone."""
552,"In your own work, I would strongly encourage presenting this as a fait accompli. A done deal. Just define your new name and put a throwaway matter of fact note in somewhere like ""\* Observable X has been referred to in some previous work as 'sugar daddy'"". Possibly explain it (outside the work) like ""...but the usage has led to complaints and distracted from the purpose of the study.""

You don't \*need\* to tell them the complaints come primarily from you. And I bet you're not the only person troubled.

This means you don't have to convince anyone to change, or that they're wrong. And if they want to protest your use \*they\* have to make the case for it."

Yes exactly, I feel like it's worth the extra effort to make sure we don't normalize these terms, especially given that my institute and field is trying to make an effort at getting rid of gender bias. I just need some solid grounds to make my argument because I'm afraid my colleagues will find this petty or ""making a fuss about nothing"""
560,"Every time I see a weirdly sexual, gendered, or even sexist name for a fairly standard tech thing, I'm like, ""either 90's or 2000's silicon valley bullshit, I guarantee it.""

Like the chemists who hosted pornography parties in smoke filled rooms before them, they did their best after pushing women out of compsci and EE to make it as uncomfortable as possible to re-enter. ""Bro pass me the bisexual cable.""

Edit: Odd request, but my mother once went to a talk at a legal convention where a woman there was discussing the casual use of sexual assault terminology in IT vocabulary. On the off chance that this talk has been given elsewhere, does anyone know of like a video or transcript of it, because I've always wanted to see it. u/TauNowBrownCow posted a similar thing relating to science fields, gonna read that."

564,"Ay girl (or guy) - GOOD ON YOU to take this initiative. I'm right behind everything  [Oleanderphd](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oleanderphd/) suggested.

I'd like to preface the tiny bit of advice I have with the fact that I'm absolutely not in your field, and never have been, so I may be ignorant about your field's etiquette...but in my experience, sending an email with a suggestion to change something may not come off as well as you want it too. Especially if it's long, it opens up the opportunity for people to call your gesture passive aggressive, controlling, or to read into it poorly in other ways. Or, and maybe this is worse, they'll ignore it entirely. 

Text doesn't always translate as well as voice, or in-person communication.

I would hate for you to be unheard in this thing that may feel small to some if they read it in an email. You probably already sent it, but I encourage following up about this in a meeting. (I almost suggested in-person, but you're probably working from home these days?)"
565,"You are the change we need in the world. High five, fellow STEM researcher!"
566,"If you’re in the US, you might use 45’s insistence on the term “Chinese virus” as a parallel. If your colleagues recognize that that is inappropriate, then they should hopefully also be open to the idea that a name based in sexism/misogyny is as bad as one based in xenophobia."
567,"u/maxedgextreme and u/tooluckyforowngood, what an interesting take on this, I actually did not fully make the connection that this might be a conscious sexual joke. For some reason I gave the benefit of the doubt that the authors didn't know better or something...  


I even found a paper where the journal removed the term from the title of the pre-print when publishing it, and my group leader pointed out that other terms that were likely coined at the same time as ""sugar daddy"" might actually also be sexual references, so I think you two might be onto something here..."
568,It is definitely used by women who have monetary relationships with men but don’t want to call themselves sex workers. There are multiple websites to find a straight sugar daddy/sugar baby on

571,"This is kind of a hard question considering there's SO much music out there. If you find most music with lyrics to be toxic or problematic I'm not sure what to recommend because... there's just so much of it and I don't know what qualifies as ""toxic or problematic"" besides the obvious."
572,"I tend to enjoy Native American and First Nations hip hop. There's usually a strong theme of social justice and respect for women and elders. Usually (but not always) less swearing than other hip hop, in case that matters to you. Frank Waln is one I enjoy

A Tribe Called Red is more club music, they're good, but not my favorite kind of music

I'm not sure how to classify Inez Jasper, but she's great

Buffy Sainte Marie is still producing some kick-ass music, she's rock I guess, and has been performing for decades. ""No No Keshagesh"" is one of my favorites

Most of these are primarily in English

I appreciate anything you drop my way :D

Plus:

>  If you find most music with lyrics to be toxic or problematic

I haven't listened to much. There's never been a musical culture in my family so to say and I haven't had a TV or radio for most of my life, not used to using to Internet to search for music really so it's kinda like I've not explored the music world almost at all and don't even know where to begin. Most of my contact with it has been occasional and I assume with the mainstream side of it (?). Someone gifted me a Spotify account and I've been trying to make use of it.

When I say toxic or problematic I mostly think about mysoginy, homophobia, racism, love songs with toxic characteristics like stalking equals love or not taking no for an answer, sexualizing kids, promoting macho attitudes, glorifying cheating, etc. EDIT: oh! glorifying jeaousy too. There's a lot of that.

I like songs with social criticism but I'm also fine with songs that explore dark themes or silly funny songs or upbeat motivating ones or whatever. I like trying new things.

Examples of English songs I found the past few years and like are (disclaimer I know nothing about most of these artists besides their name):

* My Friends by Oh Wonder

* I Am Here by Pink

* Two Birds by Regina Spektor

* Dead Boys by Sam Fender

* Real Men by Joe Jackson

* I Am Not a Robot by Marina

* Armor by Sara Bareilles

* Father and Son by Yusuf / Cat Stevens

* Blackbird by The Beatles

* Superstition by Stevie Wonder

* Mr Blue Sky by Electric Light Orchestra

* Don't Stop Me Now by Queen

* Fast Car by Tracy Chapman

* Let It Happen by Tame Impala

* What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong

* Everybody Knows by Leonard Cohen

* Masters of War by Bob Dylan

* Phoenix by League of Legends, Cailin Russo & Chrissy Costanza

* Forever by Stratovarius

* King of Spain by Moxy Früvous

* Children of Planet Earth by Melodysheep

* Vlad the Astrophysicist by Peter Mulvey

* Most of the soundtrack of Moana lol


A couple in Spanish I liked in case someone is interested:

* Libres by Mora Navarro (a recent popular feminist song from my country about abortion, femicides, women's freedom)

* Ríe chinito, Anhelando Iruya, Canción pequeña, Certo, Vértigo, Seres extraños, all by Perotá Chingó

* Shock, Mi verdad, Sacar la voz, Antipatriarca, all by Ana Tijoux

* El universo sobre mí by Amaral

* Marta, Sebas, Guille y los demás by Amaral

* Madre hay una sola by Bersuit Vergarabat

* I think the Latin Spanish version of Colors in the Wind from the blursed Pocahontas film is quite good

* Homo fugit velut umbra - Passacaglia della vita by Anonymous, L'Arpeggiata et al - it's not Spanish but I sometimes vibe with existentialist themes in literature and poetry, so this songs fits too."

the idea that only some gay women are “gold star” and that lesbians who, as you say, come out later for whatever reason, do not reach this “gold star” is offensive. all lesbian women are lesbian regardless of their sexual history, and it is this experience which is being dismissed.

those who use the term tend to look down on non-gold star lesbians, or often use it in a way akin to slut-shaming. as a bisexual woman, i’ve been told by other gay women that my being with men is somehow unattractive or a “betrayal”. the gold-star phenomenon is very similar."
594,"Other people have already covered some good points, so I'd like to add: The ""gold star lesbian"" form of gatekeeping is *also* used by lesbian-identifying TERFs to denigrate any lesbian who has been with a trans woman (because they insist trans women are men, despite all evidence to the contrary)."
595,">  But I'm confused because isn't that the whole point of lesbianism? 

No! The point of lesbianism is NOT to denigrate other lesbians, and call them less good or real than the ""gold star"" ones.

The point of lesbianism is that women who are attracted to other women are okay and fine, and go for it.

> I understand there are lesbians who had to come out later in life whether due to them not knowing they were lesbians at the time or them being in an unsafe environment and having to pretend to be straight

597,"Ok, its already a stupid idea, but using it for bisexual women is even more idiotic. I mean, might as well argue bisexuality doesnt exist.

What I find interesting is that in the heterosexual dating scene, there is a similar concept (though I dont know if there is specific term for it). Its been well-established (and a close friend of mine had to deal with this twice already) that many hetero women consider men who have had a gay experience to be less attractive, desirable, or downright ""no go"".

Do you think there is a similar mechanism at work here across the spectrum? Its not homophobia I would guess (as that wouldnt explain this issue in the lesbian/bi spectrum), its not purity culture (as these communities have little to do with that, and its among women either way), so whats the underlying issue?"

I have some bisexual female friends who have trouble dating other women because a lot of lesbians don't want to be treated as an ""experiment"" by a woman who's not *really* bi but is just ""exploring her sexuality."" Bi erasure and prejudice is real."

605,"You could spend some time googling the word and looking up its meaning. [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thot](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thot)

The answer will depend on someone's sensitivity and the context in which the word was used. Imo, it's derogatory and meant to shame women when used as a generalisation against all women or when someone hates on sexually-active or promiscuous women. I had mentioned context - coursing makes it easier for people to deal with their issues after a wrong-doing, ex. someone uses an insult after finding their partner has cheated. I wouldn't be squicked if the slur was used in such situation. It's more of a gray area for me."
606,"I don't know about slur, but it's *definitely* an insult.  As a user here noted very insightfully last time this came up, the term Karen and Thot are the new Madonna/Whore except now we're supposed to hate both of them."

I've personally seen it used to objectify and dismiss women fairly frequently. It's another word with no real male equivalent."
608,It's a misogynistic derogatory insult used to shame women for enjoying sex. It's really sad they keep coming up with these words when I thought we were past that. The same people who use that word seem to be the same people who complain when women don't have sex with them.

Until there’s an applicable term for men with a comparable connotation then the minute you want to use a term designed to shame only women for their sexual behavior then your argument or comments simply cease to matter in the slightest to me. 

I guess you could say fuckboy comes close, but men don’t have the same relationship with that word that women do with slut or thot. Women will use it as slander against each other, whereas men will not (as far as I know)."
611,"i’m loathe to immediately box up words with negative connotations as slurs. i think the way it is used as you say, as a popular internet term, is largely mild and generally with no ill intent

however, it is obviously rooted in misogyny and slut-shaming and i do find it hugely uncomfortable that derogatory words for women are popularised and joked about with no thought given to its meaning or the offence it could cause."
612,"Personally, since I don't think of ""ho"" as a slur I don't think thot is a slur either. I'm not quite sure where the line is between derogatory insult and slur is though so others may feel differently."
613,Men can now be called thots too. It just turned into a joke and a meme.
614,"I think I agree that it is a slur, like the words ""loser"" or ""bum"" are to unsuccessful people.

But to clarify, a married woman who is monogamous in the literal ""one mate for life"" sense can be sexually active, yet ""T.H.O.T."" would not apply to her. It applies to a person who is not considered morally or ethically upstanding in relation to their sexual activity.

Also while our humanities should be respected equally, I would say men and women are different to the degree that we don't always have opposite sex equivolents for their respective terms and slurs.

For example, we could say that there isn't a real female equivolent for a slur like ""scrub""."
615,"I really think context is key with any insults. Do they mean to just insult you for being you, or do they mean to insult women or a group of people as a whole?"
616,"Ho is a slur. Thot could be used as a slur, but it is mostly a joke and a meme"
617,"I disagree. I think ""thot"" is used the same way as ""bitch"" as a throwaway, derogative term for women who aren't ""performing"" as expected."
618,"We do have sex equivalent  terms. A man who has slept with a ton of women is a player and a woman who has slept with just a few men is a slut. A loud and in charge male boss is aggressive and tough while a woman is bossy or bitchy.  Just take a minute to think about these words and the standards we as a society hold women to. A lot of women deal with the emotional trauma of being labeled a thot or a slut or whatever because those words change how they are socially viewed. Can you think of any Male only words that have this effect? The word thot can and has been used to describe and objectify all types of women, even the perfectly monogamous slightly weird example you gave. If you have ever been around college guys, thot essentially just means a pretty girl"
619,"We now have the term ""fuckboy"" as well though."
620,"T.H.O.T. wasn't invented by college guys, if I'm not mistaken. It primarily denotes a woman who is easy to sleep with. But it is literally an acronym for ""that ho over there"" or ""thirsty h*es out there"". Some say it has just as much to do with her ""class"" as well. It was coined by hip hop artist Chief Keef. I haven't heard it used to describe a married, faithful, and morally upstanding woman who isn't after your celebrity or benefits. It just doesn't fit and wouldn't make sense.

And I'm honestly confused on what you meant by ""It's another word with no real male equivolent"" if you're now suggesting that every gendered insult has a real opposite sex equivolent. But if the latter is the case, then there must be a real opposite sex equivolent for ""scrub""."
621,How many frat guys abusing women have lost sleep over being called that you think?
622,"You can't possibly be comparing the psychological effects of a guy being called a scrub to a woman being called a slut....


I'm not saying every word needs a male equivalent,  how about we just call these people the same words? It doesn't matter who invented a word, what matters is who uses it, and under what context. It's funny, I think you are very close to making an excellent feminist. Your comment about ""thot"" never being used to describe women who are pretty much the exact opposite of what you'd think is nearly the right logic! A super straight arrow woman who lives her life just like any guy could never be called a thot! But it happens absolutely all the time. Women who are asexual get called thots.


 May I ask how old you are in the least condescending way possible?"
623,"mid 20s. And to be on the same page, I'd like to express my thinking and logic on this kind of gender psych topic. As a guy, we suffer more emotional abuse than most people including ourselves may realize. It is just that we have to keep frame in the right moments or else for example women are likely to treat us as either unattractive, lacking mental fortitude or too sensitive. But that's not the point. Slut means less valuable and untrustworthy, and so it lowers a woman's social standing. That hurts. Scrub means women don't like you which lowers a man's social standing, as well as he may probably die alone. That hurts. The point is, let's not forget or downplay the feelings of those other than self. I would admit that good leaders don't do that.

I agree that undeserving women may be verbally agressed upon with thot way more than men are with scrub. That is a plight women have regardless of any comparison. And I would like to also suggest that most of what we say irl is without words."
624,"The emotional abuse you are talking about comes from the institution of patriarchy which feminism seeks to tear down. The fact that men are denied their feelings, told to be rational, and stalwart to a fault is wrong and is part of toxic masculinity. Being a feminist means acknowledging these issues, and working to break down the societal norms that simply hurt everyone. Just because women don't like being called dehumanizing sexual insults all the time, doesn't mean men can't **also** be emotionally hurt by words and actions. 

You use some really concerning incel language and I want to make sure you are ok. Even though we disagree I appreciate you for talking to me. When you say
> 
women don't like you which lowers a man's social standing
> 

This is simply false many men are not even interested in women, to begin with! This idea feeds into what makes so many incels so miserable. You do not need a sexual partner to be a valid human being, and only seeking that out objectifies women as only sex objects! It is the corniest advice in the book, but if incel's spent more of their time working on hobbies, going to the gym, learning instruments, going to therapy, and learning to love themselves, they may find themselves in a mindset where it is appropriate to find a partner. 

Feminism is mostly about women, yes, but that is a reflection of the enormity of issues women face today. Women striving for equality does not hurt men. 

>“To the privileged, equality feels like oppression.”"
625,"Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. While I agree that we need some type of revolutionary thinking on how we look at sex and gender in modern times, I only empirically know patriarchy to be a theory. I do hope we can escape our own lenses as much as possible when exercising empathy toward others though.

Being an incel is not an ideology, it's just not being able to be with someone. Also, if women don't like him, it does lower a man's social standing just like if men don't like or trust a woman. It's a general thing. It's why we don't like words like slut, thot, or scrub. If we objectify each other, maybe we can't transcend that until we accept that we do. Good advice though."
626,"Patriarchy is a theory very much like gravity. The US ranks 75th for women's participation in government for example. 
> Being an incel is not an ideology, it's just not being able to be with someone
> 

You sound like you are just describing a lonely person. There are millions of people looking for love. Incels struggle because women avoid their toxic and hateful personalities. Incels choose to transfer blame away from themselves and onto women because it is easy. Then when women avoid them, they blame anyone but themselves. Sometimes we don't choose to feel lonely, but there is nothing involuntary about being an involuntary celibate."
627,"Why is it that when I describe how males can be vulnerable, you go to an incel discussion. Just now, that did feel dismissive."
628,"Oooh, another antagonistic/low-effort question that’s ripe for downvoting. Let’s see how this turns out, shall we?"
629,"I have time, so:

""Believe Women"" is not meant to imply that anyone accused of sexual misconduct should be immediately assumed to be guilty and summarily punished. It simply means that when a person makes an accusation of a crime that has been committed against them, people should take it seriously and investigate it with the assumption that the victim is being truthful, instead of displaying skepticism, trying to talk the victim out of ""making a big deal,"" or trying to convince the victim that whatever happened either wasn't that bad or didn't happen the way they said it did.

The Presumption of Innocence (or ""innocent until proven guilty"") is, rightfully, a core tenet of modern democracies. However, it is a legal principle, and as such only has bearing in the course of legal/court proceedings. What individuals or the public can, and do, determine for themselves about a public accusation is their decision alone. People can choose to act upon that accusation as they see fit (within confines of the law). Legal precedents do not apply to everyday life or social interaction.

Furthermore, the likelihood of:

1) you being falsely accused of rape

2) it ""ruining your life"" if it happens

are very small. Many men who were *credibly* accused of sexual misconduct continue to enjoy wealth and fame. And as /u/noonecar3s noted, it is more likely that you yourself would be sexually assaulted, rather than falsely accused.

People behave as though women are lying in wait to accuse men of raping them for fun, fame, attention, and profit, but can you name three women who've accused famous men-- without Googling? They didn't get fame. They were blamed and shamed in the media or paid off by rich men's lawyers. Hell, name TWO. Sexual assaults go unreported at least 60% of the time. Most women are raped by a friend, a date, or someone else they know who is close to them. 97% of rapists don’t see the inside of a prison cell for even a day, because reporting a rape is often more traumatic than the crime itself. It’s not that it doesn’t happen, but very few people would be willing to put themselves through invasive physical exams, repeated retelling/reliving of their assault, and skeptical interrogations by disinterested police officers. Or if you’re a male victim, in which case, reporting a sexual assault is damn near impossible. Why would so many people put themselves through the hell that is rained down upon rape victims just for petty revenge?"
630,As a man you are statistically more likely to be raped than to be accused of rape.
631,"**TL;DR. Get a lawyer involved asap if you're falsely accused.**

Fake accusations of rape make up a small number of resolved rape cases and as far as I know, rarely end up in the favour of the accuser. I'm not saying these don't happen, but without any evidence of your crime or you admitting to it, you won't get imprisoned. ""Innocent until proven guilty"" is still a standard in the court and there's no way to alter it so it's still just. I'm not sure where your opinion comes from. However, majority of victims of sexual abuse don't receive any help, some don't realize or aren't able to assess what has happened for years. Some aren't believed even when they have the evidence. You're more likely to become a victim of sexual abuse yourself ([source](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-men-are-more-likely-to-be-raped-than-be-falsely-accused-of-rape), have it in mind that most cases are unresolved and not reported; there's also the issue of non-viable data regarding how many rape cases there are) or get killed than be falsely accused. As for your example:

>Brian was given 10 minutes to make a call on this impossible dilemma: essentially plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit, or risk facing life behind bars. \[[source](https://www.distractify.com/p/what-happened-to-brian-banks-accuser)\]

Either way, the premise of my initial argument is that 0 (or 4... or even 50) cases in all of the UK and United States does not a statistic make. If these are the only cases, a man is actually less likely to go to prison for a false rape/sexual assault accusation than effectively any other criminal behaviour."

Back to the question in the title - feminists advocate for equal rights. No real feminists would say women are innocent by definition or they can't be brought to justice and deal with the consequences of their actions. Scroll down and click the link to the FAQ on the right to learn the basics of feminism. Responsibility is the product of having rights. There's no difference between those 2 terms."

643,"I support the legalization of sex work in order to drag it out into the sunlight and provide additional safety and support to the women in the industry, full stop. Do I support a society that enables women to own their sexuality? Absolutely. But I do not, in any way, harbour the illusion that the legalization of sex work will spontaneously birth a feminist utopia where women are no longer shamed and objectified."
644,"Use the search bar next time. The opinion varies among feminists. I'd say objectification is part of human nature (but I'm not much of a poststructual feminist, neither a radical one). However, this doesn't mean people should treat others like a toy. Sex workers can veto clients and use their sexuality to secure the bag. For me it's just a job - everybody has to get by and folks should be able to choose what to do with their bodies/sexuality. There's a stigma against sex work (and feminists aren't free of whorephobia, we still can be bigoted or controlling of other people without realizing it; feminism is a tool to analyse reality after all and there are a few branches which you can read about in the FAQ). They don't normalise abuse or lead men astray (your post is pretty heteronormative and ignores the fact that many sex workers are in fact queer). No one's entitled to anybody - sex work is about providing a service of intimacy and/or entertainment. Saying that sex workers ""normalise abuse and push men into the wrong direction"" is a conservative take that swipes objectification with control. You can't solve people's problems through the abolishment of their job and the source of their money. It's like saying ""don't be poor"" or ""just change your job"". This abolishing attitude leads to pushing people underground and more risk-taking. Sex workers don't magically disappear after getting banned or having their resources taken from them. Moreover, abolitionists use their laws to control other women's bodies - just look how major social media bans female nudity thanks to SESTA/FOSTA.

Think about it - why free sex is right but paid sex is a crime? This doesn't make sense. Oh, and you don't say anything about male models or other jobs where men use their appearance to their advantage. Doesn't it ring a bell? Regarding abuse in the sex industry - sex workers or victims of sex trafficking (which is rare, and rarer than other types of trafficking according to data from ILO). It's also worth asking and reaching for the voice of the marginalised group itself - you should seek out voices of the sex workers and look for their organisations or unions. Some feel empowered by what they do, some do it out of necessity, some treat it like any other job. I see it as a legitimate job.

edit: I'm sex-positive and pro-decrim. Sex and desire are natural (this isn't about ace/aro people for the sake of staying on topic). I find people saying things such us ""women give sex"", ""women are automatically victims"" and the like problematic. First, it promotes learned helplessness, shames sexually-active women so they end up going against their desire and choose a safer, prude route. I'm not saying not being sexual is bad, but it is when the person is shamed into that position. This attitude also presents passiveness as the rightful place of the woman and infantilises women. You won't have a happy society without de-stigmatising female sexuality and encouraging critical thought as well as the advocacy for reliable sex ed."
645,"You know, you bring up a very good point. But thanks to the society we live in, sex work *will* always exist, as long as poverty exists. So considering there is not too much we can do to change the economic state of a society, we may as well take time to ensure the safety of sex workers by legalizing it. I don't particularly encourage sex work, but I do recognize it as her choice and usually one of few ways for an impoverished woman to deliver for herself and her family."
646,"This is pretty much spot on. Unfortunately we don't live in a world (and I dont think we ever will) where women can not be objectified sexually. It's been so engrained biologically and socially that I dont think itll ever go away. 

As for sex work I pondered this exact question myself. The sex industry once you peel back the brave woman in the casting room is filled with such disgusting objectification of the female body its rank. There are sex slaves, human trafficking, child pornography, rapings, sometimes even murders. All for the sake of satisfying ""mans need"". 

I've asked myself whether the woman on the casting lounge or the ""onlyfans"" girl streaming herself, has any self respect or not. I have no issue with porn myself but I'm deffinately not disillusioned about what happens. I think women are kidding themselves if they think they can do this freely and without being objectified. Most women do it for money (which IMO isnt a good reason to objectify yourself) or they do it for attention. 

Some call it freeing and liberating but as someone who's been in the industry herself before. It's not. You're still objectified. You're still treated like a second class citizen and you're still used only for mens enjoyment and discarded later."

if you're okay with sex work don't you also have to be okay with other forms of sexual objectification? if not how are we cherry picking when its okay or when its not? it seems very inconsistent.

I didn't mention male models etc because in society are large it's women who are trying to get away from the stigma of being sexualized in every walk of life.

Women are the ones who suffer most from the ideals of objectification with things like catcalling etc. 

and nobody is saying we should just abolish their jobs, im simply stating there seems to a be a conflict of ideals and seems kinda hypocritical at times.

I personally don't think sex work in general is positive because it portrays a message that womens sexuality can just be bought like any other service or commodity and  reduces them down to an object. That being said I support it as a means to sustain yourself via income etc if necessary.

657,">Can you clarify what you mean when you say  ""own their sexuality""?

It's a pretty standard concept [with plenty of material on the subject](https://feministcampus.org/campaigns/sex-positivity/). But let's just start with the fact that there were an depressing number of women who posted on a recent front page thread saying that they had only recently learned they did not pee out of their vagina. 

>Also it's great that you think it should be legalised but that doesn't really attest to my points, 

Perhaps your points are prioritizing the wrong things?

>do you personally think that a person can be against the objectification of women and a sex worker simultaneously? 

Yes.

>if so how? because it seems the very nature of sex work supports the idea of men objectifying women.

Maybe you should share how you believe that all sex work is ***inherently*** objectification? Why should sex work be treated any differently than any other service? Are you saying all bus drivers are being objectified as well?

Maybe actually read up on objectification. I don't think it means what you think it means."
658,"I strongly disagree. There's consent therefore that's not ""rape by definition"". I find your statement harmful because it widens the definition of abuse as well as infantilises women.

If someone manages to have their nails painted by coercing the beautician, then that's crossing of someone's boundaries and exploitation."
659,"What I'll say is that I do not encourage it, and I'd rather that the government did much more to combat poverty and income inequality so no one would have to become a sex worker, but I recognise it as one of very few options for a woman to escape the effects of poverty. I'll not encourage it, and neither shall society, but we should should not treat a woman differently for trying to escape poverty through one of the few options she has.

And for people who do it for personal choice (which by the way is a pretty small minority), I'm kind of on the fence on that. I mean, if she doesn't have to turn to sex work and has other options, then I think we should redirect her towards those other options, but again we should not treat her differently for her choices"

No one holds any illusions about the quality of life for most sex workers. But legalization is still better than what they have now.

663,"But the consent isn’t an enthusiastic Yes. it is based on you being in a situation that make you say Yes. As you put it, everyone tries to survive.

If i made you paint my nails you’d get over it pretty quickly but if i raped you, it would maybe have a deep psychological impact on you. I’m
Sex positive too. Consensual sex where the power dynamic is fair and not dictated by money. But i won’t agree that sex is just the same as being a cashier.

Sex as a commodity or service is not the objectification just like registered massage therapist is not objectification.

Whether a relationship has a power dynamic is up to the individual. I don't think paying for sex is immoral for example.

One of the leaders of Amnesty Norway is also a known person who is against the Swedish model. All the members of Womens Front (feminist organization in Norway) left Amnesty after their report.  Most of this stuff is in Norwegian, but I can link you to an english version that describes how they are quite controversial.

[https://kvinnefronten.no/sex-trade-survivors-symposium/](https://kvinnefronten.no/sex-trade-survivors-symposium/)

The most important part of this article is that Amnesty claims that violence has increased in Norway after the swedish model and bases this claim on research done by one person. 
This person has later had to come on the news and admit that their research was flawed and the truth can just as well be that violence is at same level or even decreased. Amnesty still quotes this research as proof that conditions have become worse for prostitutes after buying of sex became illegal!"
671,"Sorry I really don't agree, 

First I would say that a massage therapist selling massages doesn't contribute to sexual objectification because it has nothing to do with sex or anything remotely sexual,
but sex work does.

Why is it they use women to sell cars though?

The reason it's sexual objectification when a car company uses a women's body to sell cars is because ""sex sells"" they are using the sexuality of an attractive women to appeal to men,
(their target demographic usually)

I don't see how a sex worker using her sexuality to appeal to men is any different in fact it's exactly the same it's just she is doing to her own benefit vs a car company doing it."
672,">Sorry I really don't agree, 

Probably because your question isn't all that genuine and you have issues with sex positivity, women being sexual, and still believe virginity has value.

>First I would say that a massage therapist selling massages doesn't contribute to sexual objectification because it has nothing to do with sex or anything remotely sexual, but sex work does.

That was a lot of words to say ""this is true because this is true"". Sex work is sexual. Sex work doesn't have to be objectification.

>The reason it's sexual objectification when a car company uses a women's body to sell cars is because ""sex sells"" they are using the sexuality of an attractive women to appeal to men, (their target demographic usually)

Except the term isn't ""sexual objectification"", it's just ""***object***ification"". You're just making shit up at this point."
673,"now you're just being disingenuous, I never said anything about virginity having value and it's not a belief I hold. 

 ""this is true because this is true"" I don't know where this comes from I showed you how a massage therapist and a sex worker are different which was the example YOU gave me.

sexual objectification is a real term one simple google would show you this believe it or not there is a difference in seeing something as an object and as a sexual object.

I don't appreciate being told i'm making things up when all you have done here is strawman, make bad comparisons and you don't really seem to understand what we are talking about.

Sexual objectification is the act of treating a person solely as an object of sexual desire.Objectification more broadly means treating a person as a commodity or an object without regard to their personality or dignity."
674,">""this is true because this is true"" I don't know where this comes from I showed you how a massage therapist and a sex worker are different which was the example YOU gave me.

Right. You said ""these things are different because they are different"". Not ***why*** they are different. Sex is a service. Massage is a service. Uber is a service. Why is it that when someone says sex you immediately tack on ""objectification""…?

>sexual objectification is a real term one simple google would show you this believe it or not there is a difference in seeing something as an object and as a sexual object.

Not in the way you're using it, no. The key part is ***object***, not sex. 

>don't really seem to understand what we are talking about.

Pot, meet kettle.

>Sexual objectification is the act of treating a person solely as an object of sexual desire. Objectification more broadly means treating a person as a commodity or an object without regard to their personality or dignity.

Fine. Give an example of ""objectification"" involving women that you believe is devoid of sexuality or anything sexual."
675,"what how do you not follow, Sex work is different from other services because it involves sex. 

Getting a massage does NOT reinforce the idea that a woman's value is in her sexuality but sex work DOES reinforce this idea.

an example would be something like slavery where people were treated and still are treated as a commodity that is objectifying that isn't sexual. It's anytime you USE someone as an object or Tool."
676,"In my [admittedly anecdotal] experience, the men who claim to make completely emotionless, logical decisions aren't any less emotional, they just lack the emotional intelligence to identify when and how their emotions affect their decision making.

---

^Edit: ^Thanks ^for ^the ^awards ^and ^updoots ^folks."
677,*Anyone* that claims they operate on “logic and facts” instead of “emotions and feelings” does not. They have simply convinced themselves that all of their emotional reactions are logical ones. The fact that they don’t realize this makes them MORE subject to their emotions.
678,"One observation I have had that indicates that a lot of men are emotionally repressed is when they meet a new woman that they like they tend to dump a lot of pent up thoughts and emotions on her. I’ve experienced it first hand, getting all of their long kept secrets or troubles told to me and even on first dates. It happens to my girl friends too, even guys breaking down crying over past issues. It’s like all of the things they couldn’t share with their guy friends, family or coworkers they dump out the second they meet a love interest. Can anyone else relate to this experience?"
679,"Yes. Most of our drives, all of our values, are emotional. There is no such thing as a purely logical decision. Logic cannot tell you *what you want*.

The only way to do everything “logically”, like a computer, is to run your life on scripts that you’ve been given and rigidly follow social norms like they’re universal truths. This is relatively easy and comfortable for straight, cis, able white men on a college and career track. Everyone there wants to perform well and raise their grades/salaries. Doing so is just *logical*; no need to acknowledge the emotional needs for security, status and comfort behind it. 

Later on, I think this mindset contributes to male mid-life crises. Men approach the peak of their life and finally realise they never considered their own needs."
680,"How many ""logical, rational"" scientists drew ""factual"" conclusions on humankind that happened to leave out the experience of every human who wasn't a straight, white, able-bodied, male?"
681,"Not to be flippant about this, but I've seen my brother screech at his computer screen because his game was going a little slower than usual like a banshee foreboding a loved one's imminent death, if he's supposed to be a master of his emotions by virtue of gender, then mankind is unfit to wield any of the the tools it built. Better to live in burrows in the woods then."
682,"No guy does that. We say that because it’s been hammered into us too pretend that’s what’s happening.Speaking only for myself and my own experience - what you described is the other side of the patriarchy. The notion I should be devoid of all emotion and cut them off to make decisions was hammered into me by almost everyone in my life as far back as I can remember. Enforcement was vía men and women in my life.

Don’t cry. Don’t be happy. Don’t be sad. I grew up in a very rural area and anything not the norm was targeted. It was designed to make you hollow. That men are more rational than women is BS. I think there’s something said there’s a very general difference for how and what problems we are good at solving. And that men and we men might get to conclusions differently. But that’s not a black and white observation."
683,"Lol. Men are not more rational let alone logical. There would be less wars if that was the case. They are just taught it's unmanly and pretend their feelings are ""facts"".

(And nothing against men, they are fine, just the system that sucks)"
684,"You might be interested in looking into feminist epistemology and it’s connection to philosophy of science - those fields provide a ton of critique and analysis of the ideas you are mentioning and how they have significantly negative effects on all of us. 

There have been studies that show humans generally reason backwards justifying their emotions rather than postponing judgement/emotion until they’ve been able to ‘rationally’ evaluate an issue. We are absolutely only told that men are rational and logical. Look at the replicability crisis - hard sciences aren’t even solely rational and logical, they are very much affected by social/human factors."
685,"“Rational is a slave to the passions”
-Humes

“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”
-Richard P. Feynman

The most illogical thing to do, is convince ourselves we’re logical. All our conclusions, should be met with skepticism, self analysis, and peer review. This isn’t to say that these emotions aren’t valid, however, as someone thats been on both sides of this, I think there’s a greater danger in someone convincing themselves that emotions related to testosterone are logical. We then mistake irrational emotions like fear, anger, aggression, and protectiveness for logic."
686,"No they are not more “rational”. They are less likely to express their emotions as it’s taboo for men to do so. Although, being emotional doesn’t mean you’re irrational. It means that a certain topic is important to you. People used to call suffragettes irrational and emotional because they were angry they didn’t have the same rights as men. 

Today’s culture tends to tie stoicism to rationality which isn’t actually true and as a result, as men aren’t allowed to express emotion and women are, it ties rationality to masculinity which is also false."
687,"I never understood this distinction. I can tell you that as a man, I have plenty of emotions. Forgive the bioessentialism, but having a penis and extra testosterone does not preclude me from allowing emotion to influence attempts at cold, logical decisions.  
  
In addition, I don't see the unemotional/rational and emotional/irrational couplings as valid. Lack of emotion doesn't produce perfect logic, and emotion doesn't immediately create faulty logic. ALSO the logical answer isn't always the right one if it's built on bad premises. It might be ""logical"" to say that COVID-19 is good for the earth because it is reducing human impact on the earth, but this disregards the premise that humans working together can achieve a net positive global impact."
688,Men have feelings. Women have feelings. This is equivalence and simple logic.
689,"I think you are right in identifying this cultural expectation of men. Likely a mirror to the historical cultural idea ""women are hysterical and emotional"" which lead to things like ""women and not cut out for jobs like scientist and engineer"". Obviously these are all incorrect and in reality this means men are simply not taught emotional intelligence. This then leads to toxic masculinity and women performing a significant amount of emotional labor (I would argue that emotional labor, even compared to ""housework"" like cooking and cleaning, is the leading aspect of the feminine gender role that remains unpaid labor; especially because of how companies continue to exploit it and then use it as an argument to pay women _less_).

More modern examples of this are the ""rational"" men of youtube, who tend to be anything but. They often go on (right wing, woman hating) emotional screeds (and there are plenty of logical and thoughtful people of many genders on youtube who argue with them).

If there is actual rationality to be had, I think the [less wrong rationality essays](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality) are a good starting point. Backed by cognitive science, embracing emotional intelligence, and regularly digging at the ""rational"" men of youtube (e.g. ""To reason correctly about evolutionary psychology you must simultaneously consider many complicated abstract facts that are strongly related yet importantly distinct, without a single mixup or conflation."" The implication being that many ""rational thinkers"" make those mixups and conflations regularly (often to the detriment of women), and that's why the author - an actual cognitive scientist - prefers to avoid the subject)."
690,"As a guy, we are 100% taught by society that we need to be rational, logical, and unemotional all the time. But that's all nonsense, we all have feelings and emotions. If anything, guys are just better at repressing them which causes them to be unemotional."
691,"Men have feelings just like women.  They might not show them as much because of stereotypes, but that’s starting to change. They’re human."
692,"We're either taught that we're inherently more logical or, more insidiously, we are so often told that we must be stoic and logical so much that we start assuming that we are logical and stoic because to do otherwise would be a failure of our manhood.

It's incredibly hard to break out of that mold because you've gotten used to assuming that you're right by default, and that any evidence to the contrary is just emotional drivel that shouldn't be trusted.

And it's not just white men in America: I grew up in the Middle East before immigrating to the States and it's just as prevalent there, if not more."
693,"As someone who was a man for a while (didn't like it that much for other reasons), it's definitely a socialization thing. They're taught that feelings are totally irrational and to supress them as much as possible - while there are differences between male and female emotional responses, there's no reality to the idea that a) emotions are either rational or irrational, and b) that men are more inherently rational than women.

Irrational behaviour is extremely easy to identify and the irrational justifications for it are similarly void. If you ever see a man try and explain why he got into a fight, it usually revolves around a misinterpretation of a social signal being perceived as an insult (which due to the obviously real social consequences of being insulted by a stranger in a bar, must be defended against)

There are situations where I can enter that rational, logical, and unemotional mental state (and the idea that men are more practiced at doing this in patriarchal societies might hold some water), women can do this, and can do it just as well. And equally, it's a temporary mental state - not a permanent thing."
694,"Yes! I agree with your point.

Although I wanna suggest that the stereotype is not completely false (just not by nature). I think men tend to indeed be more “rational” because they more often engage in problem-focused coping (thinking of ways to fix the problem) than women who I’d say tend to engage in emotion-focused (thinking of ways to change/deal with their feelings about the problem). Problem-focused coping works when there is an effective solution to the problem that can be found if addressed in a constructive manner. Emotion-focused coping works better when the problem is out of your control. I think this explains why some men tend to react “rationally” to things that should not be reacted rationally to and act like everything is a problem they need to fix (ever gotten advice from a man while you were just trying to vent?) while a lot of women will endure negative feelings and act like problems are not fixable when they are. Both of those tendencies are the result of gendered socialization that tells men to DO and women to ACCEPT. Both sets of coping mechanisms are important and appropriate for different situations and I think we should be careful to dismiss the whole notion of rationality because sexism has tainted it. We need rationality and irrationality to work in concert in ourselves, not one or the other."
695,"I think it's worse than that. I think men's pity for women's position throughout history has developed into a revolutionary trope. There's a scene in the novel Germinal where a Coal Mine strike leads to this violent confrontation between a manager and a group of women that had been raped by him. They cut his balls and dick off, and it symbolises a triumph in the book. Women represent a placeholder for the legitimacy of our own feelings. Because we place ourselves as owners, leaders, ect., we place ourselves in charge of reasoning and think of women as advisors. It's an outdated stereotype and a worn trope in art and politics."
696,"I can only speak for myself, since I try to do this. I try to remain calm and think clearly about what actions to take or decisions to make. It’s a learned skill and it has nothing to do with sex or gender. It’s basically just making a mental pros/cons list on the fly.

So my answer to your question, OP, is neither."

699,"I think it has to do with how we are raised. I know my father was rough on me and always pushed for me not to show emotions. While letting my sister's express their selves much more emotionally. We are still intact emotional we are just conditioned to hide it more or even go against our own emotions. 

Even in today's society men being emotional is a lot of the time looked down on and seen as weak even by women. 

I've made the mistake of crying or showing to much emotions infront of women (non feminist) and have been shocked at some of the reactions they can have."

703,"From an actual man, we are largely tought to ""walk it off"" and told that our feelings do not matter. We are supposed to be ""tough"" and showing emotions (other than anger) is ""weak."" As a result, many men pretend like they do not have emotions at all and many men are also very out-of-touch with their emotions."
704,"This is a big fact. In my experience, they also often don’t address anger as part of having an ‘emotional reaction’."
705,"Also, hello gentlemen, anger is an emotion."
706,"""Facts and Logic^(tm)"" is a performative act that allows men to pretend that their emotional weakness doesn't exist, rather than doing the hard work on their emotions to turn their weakness into a strength.

Unfortunately, men in power have no such drawbacks and are reliably able to emotionally manipulate the men beneath them--while insisting that the emotions they're manipulating don't exist, shouldn't exist, and must not resist.

Emotional ignorance is a great example of how patriarchy hurts men too."
707,You ever notice how their supposedly dispassionate and logical conclusions somehow always coincide with their emotional desires?
708,That's been my experience as well. Everyone is affected by their emotions.
709,"my dad to a tee. swore he was all about facts and logic. in hindsight, 99% of his decision-making was based in his anxiety.

you *can't* make decisions emotion-free. everyone has emotions, that's what they're there for: to give you information that helps you decide what to do. but if you ignore that the emotion is there, you're going to *think* you're justified way more often and have no room for checking yourself because you truly think there's nothing to check in on. you can't actually make a clear decision without acknowledging the emotions that are coming into play."
710,"I don't think that ""intelligence"" is the right word. I think men and women have the same emotional intelligence, but men are socialized to be less introspective. As a result, they are less familiar and less experienced when dealing with emotions. I think that is what leads to many men who get emotions unknowingly mixed up in their decision making. 

Also, I should probably point out that emotion in decision making is a pretty genderless issue, however,  women generally are more aware that there is emotion affecting their decision making."
711,"This is kind of how I feel. I turned off a YouTube video about ""Woke Culture"" by a channel I'd thought was reliable, after first several minutes where the critic was just talking about how rational and logical he was going to be about the issue, even though everyone else is knee-jerk and reactionary and emotional, and blah blah. (I still don't even know whether he was for or against 'woke' movies.) 

I was reminded of the lesson I learned in grade-10 English when reading EA Poe's ""Tell-Tale Heart"": If the first thing the narrator says is that he's definitely not crazy, HE'S PROBABLY CRAZY."
712,"Damn that resonated with me. I absolutely have that mindset even though I'm an incredibly sensitive guy. The two simply don't mix and no human being operates without emotional biases. To say you're 'Taking yourself out of an emotional state to look at things in a factual way' is bullshit. I have absolutely been reactionary and thought ""I'm just operating off of data and facts"". Nah. Ignoring emotions makes them build up and I'm definitely seeing a trend of posts about men that dump all of their emotional baggage and rely on their partner to emotionally carry them through. I did that. It's wrong. I'm bi-polar. I'm just starting to realize lately the stress that puts on her to ""be a good partner"". It's an imbalance and isn't fair. I should try to be more open to others and shit if my Male friends shut me down for putting myself out there then maybe they aren't healthy friends to have. There is absolutely a culture of no support. Someone I know called the suicide hotline the other day and the woman said that 3/4th's of her calls are men that are just gushing and bursting and the seams with emotion they can't handle. Thank you for your post; it's helping me be more self-aware."
713,"This reminds me of how straight men cope so much worse with divorce or losing a spouse in the long run because their primary emotional support source is their wife, while women tend to share emotions and get support from family and friends and so aren't so left alone when separated."
714,"Haha this JUST happened to me. It wasn't even a ""love interest"" really, but this guy I met pretty much just used me as a tool to work through a bunch of his emotional bullshit, and now he just doesn't talk to me anymore. The whole thing took about 3 months."
715,oh my god yes. as though going on a date/having sex once makes you qualified to be their therapist?? like... sir do you have no friends you could talk to about this?
716,"Interesting! I haven't noticed it in my own experience, but I recently read about it in [Love Hacked by Penny Reid](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49998841-love-hacked?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=WhwYBY58Fo&rank=10). The premise is that the woman, a psychologist, has spent two years going on weekly blind dates with men who break down and cry before the entrees are even served. The book is good, by the way, and I recommend it."
717,"I’ve honestly got this with friends, as well. Not just love interests."
718,"> I think this mindset contributes to male mid-life crises

I think this is also a major contributor to how badly men fare emotionally after a divorce-- they have a lot of complicated feelings and no way to deal with them, and nowhere to dump them (e.g., their former female partner). They lose the person who was the ""cruise director"" for their life and find themselves suddenly completely adrift."
719,Interesting. Thanks for adding this dimension to the conversation.
720,"Seriously. One needs to look no further than the history of eugenics, phrenology, and other forms of scientific racism to understand that science, a process carried out by human beings (and historically, a small subset of human beings representing only the most privileged of society), is subject to all of the human biases and prejudices that shape all other human pursuits."

Showed a white friend an article written by a black woman in the most toned down voice possible about how white women abuse their tears to trigger patriarchy linked protection mechanisms. He responded not to the article itself, but to the tone, calling it combative and asking why the author ""gets to write using emotions, but every time I write a paper I make sure it's 100% logical and contains no emotions."" He then tried to respond using the language of ""logic"" alone, which, to nobody's surprise didn't work out very well because he was writing about something emotional while trying his hardest not to be, sorta like what the author of the piece was talking about to begin with (hm...). Didn't have the heart to tell the guy that discomfort was an emotion."
744,"Well most our guy friends are in the same exact situation.. we don't have the emotional support like some women do with their friends. Most cases we still have to put on a tough face and act like everything is alright. 

This is one thing I have noticed as being a guy to is many women are not accepting of us being emotional either. Many women fall for the same stereotypes. They want us to be strong and confident and the moment we show weakness it tends to back fire on us. Conditioning us to be more emotionally silent in the future."
745,"Yeah, probably. My brother is otherwise a peaceful person and a feminist to boot, but he does not show his feelings at all. He's been working on it in therapy. His outbursts used to scare the everloving crap out of me though, so I reserve the right to joke about them."

752,"> They want us to be strong and confident and the moment we show weakness it tends to back fire on us

Is it that you were ""showing weakness,"" or was it that you dumped your entire emotional load into a woman's lap without asking or reciprocating and expecting her to help you deal with it? Big difference."
753,"I understand your dilemma, I just have one question. Why are guys so fiercely loyal to their friends who won't give them the time of day to listen to their problems, but are happy ditch their girlfriends with no regard even though their girlfriends will be the ones happy to support them through all of it? I had this issue with my ex and he said that it's because if he really needed something like a place to stay or money or something they would be there and I was so confused because I was always there, and these guys also bullied him for years which was one of his biggest traumas, if not the biggest, but he will be loyal to them over me? Granted he knew them for years and he knew me for a few months, but that says even more if I'm supportive right from the offset without bullying him and would help him out no problem whether we were together or not after only a few months, but just because he can talk about porn and games with his friends any support I offer is looked over by comparison. I think maybe some girls just don't support guys because what's the point of treating someone like your number 1 when all their friends who wouldn't give them the time of day to even do something for them like listen to their problems are their number 1."
754,Yeah i understand.  That sounds like how i was growing up. I didn't seek therapy though so that should save him from a lot of trouble and time.
755,*forgiven*
756,"ahh sorry, I was looking at it from the powerful's side of things. Racism (irrational feelings) have a lot to do with convincing a populace and some soldiers to go to war.

757,"I mean, okay, but you can't just pretend they don't exist right now."
758,"Once again though we are raised like this. I am sure many of us would seek therapy if it didnt make others look down on us as weak.. (also if we could actually even afford it)

I may have emotionally unloaded on a few girlfriends in highschool which sure I regret now but at the time I was simply just desperate. It was always after I let them be emotional towards me first. Yet when I tried to get the same back it never went well and I'd have to bottle that all up or the relationship was clearly over. 

I def don't think it's responsible to unload on women like that I am just trying to say that under the conditions many men are raised it's the first opportunity to be emotional and having such little experience being able to open up it ends up just being a complete tidal wave."
759,"I actually do not know the answer here as I have never been like this. Im kinda on the opposite spectrum and have always had issues keeping guy friends. Ive always had issues with toxic masculinity and things like that so I always end up just bailing on guy friends most my life. 

I am not a psychologist either but maybe these kinda guys had father issues or something like that? It sounds like hes in a abusive relationships with his male friends but continues to go back seeking their acceptance. Which is def not healthy but I wouldnt understand why he would seek such things. 

Sorry you have gone through that though."

Yes, you are accurately describing the problem."
762,"So many times I hear men talk about women that blew them off after they opened up emotionally and it usually seems to lead back to grade school or high school.  I mean really? We're talking about kids here.

I have 4 daughters all of which I've either gone through their teenage years or they're teenagers now.  We've had big problems with a few boys becoming irate and threatening when my daughter's couldn't be on the phone or text listening to their problems.  It didn't matter if my daughter spent hours listening to a boys problem.  The one time she didn't make him a priority he'd lose his shit and start dragging her through social media about how he was always there for her but she was *never* there for him"".

I made a post a few months back about this.  This is a big problem for a lot of young girls."
763,"Is there some reason that men have to tell people they're in therapy?  I mean, why can't you go to therapy and not share that with anyone if you think they'll look down on you for it.

Sounds like more excuses to me."
764,"Thank you for your answer man :) I really feel for you because it sounds like your situation is really shit and nobody should have to deal with what you are going through.

I think most guys are like my ex unfortunately, they say they like being able to open up but ultimately take it for granted because they see dealing with women's feelings as a chore, whereas with guys who always hide their feelings and just keep it to themselves (unless it's anger), they see being able to just talk about porn and games as being able to ""just be yourself"". They don't have to bother worrying about moral issues of how they are viewing women with other guys because they will never care about the morality of it, and won't see any issue with gaming all day, not showering, and never leaving your house for 3 days in a row. And I guess ultimately most guys see being able to do whatever they want without being challenged on it with the expectation of being a good person as more important than someone who will emotionally support them, plus obviously if guys are used to not dealing with anyone's emotional problems then they will probably find it annoying when girls expect them to listen and be patient and understanding with theirs as well.

It seems most guys get taught to just keep rolling like a stone through life and problems instead of being allowed to be emotional (except for anger of course which guys always make known) so they just learn to internalise everything except anger and annoyance, and learn to suppress emotions so they learn to deal with stuff without emotion. Then I guess when they have utilise their emotions for something like empathy or sympathy they are shit at it because they learnt not to be emotional, and then when women need and expect understanding, patience and emotional support they get annoyed because they learnt to deal with everything themselves."
765,"Yeah I agree. My sister went through it really bad. She had a guy who would show up at our house threatening to kill himself cause she wasn't there for him or something like that. It was really rough on her. 

I am sure there is a lot to it. When we are young we def think the world revolves around us and we lash out when we don't get our way. 

I never did anything like that.. it was just more me just crying about family issues and such."
766,"I didn't want to respond to any of this because like, looking at the rest of what you've said here, you just seem kind of terrible. For other more reasonable folks I hope this helps you all understand: When I was younger and told my parents that I needed therapy, my father initially said nothing, then took me into a room the next day and asked me why I needed therapy when I could just not be depressed. He also blocked my efforts to get medicines for months because he thought that

1. pain meds just dulled what needed to be felt (I know depression meds aren't pain meds, he didn't believe it)

2. depression is just something that goes away with gumption

3. If you breathe better anxiety goes away
 
Turns out that shit was clinical, ran in the family, and my sister also had all of it. She started going to therapy before I did. She didn't have to deal with that kind of bullshit, wonder why...

But all of that is irrelevant, and you know why? BECAUSE MENTAL HEALTH SHOULDN'T BE STIGMATIZED LIKE THAT AND MEN *SHOULD* BE ABLE TO TELL OTHER MEN THAT THEY ARE IN THERAPY. THAT'S A PROBLEM DOG! THAT'S MEN'S PROBLEM TO SOLVE BUT MAKING FUN OF DUDES WHO DON'T SEEK THERAPY IS JUST CRUEL.

Edit: Reading more of this thread, this is either some kind of MRA troll or an FDS devotee, swear to God. I'm leaning heavy FDS, they're using the exact FDS talking points on mental health. Hope this ain't a regular."
767,"Well at the time when I was in highschool I'd have no idea how to get therapy and like I mentioned before I don't think I'd have been able to afford it. 

Also I still can't handle but feel like there is a double standard here. I've had girls unload on me emotionally. What kind of monster would have I have been if I told them to seek therapy?"
768,"I'm not making fun of anyone.  It just seems pretty simple AS AN ADULT to just not tell anyone if they're assholes about therapy.

For children who are at the mercy of their parents, it's different.  It's not a child's fault that their parent is an idiot.  That said, I thought we were talking about adults here, not children."
769,Yes.  The poor mens.
770,"This kinda fits exactly my point. I am explaining a situation  of why men handle things emotionally wrong and you are now insulting me. 

I am not sure where I am supposed to go from here other than hold it in and shut up about it. Cycle repeats."
771,"Well, you weren't talking about men.  You were talking about children.  A child can speak to their parents and ask for help just as a man can just make up his mind to get help.

So my questions is still valid.  Why do men have to tell anyone they're in therapy if it falls negatively on them.  Answer:  they don't and no one ever has to know."
772,"Honestly, call them out on it. If you changed, then there is a chance that some your other friends may change as well. But if they don't, cut them off. It sounds harsh and possibly drastic, but if you want to actually stay true to how you've changed, that may be the only way."
773,It would be a good idea to get the perspective and advice of r/MensLib on this issue!
774,"Words can be a lot more harmful than most people think. Your friend will remember the teasing and humiliation for his entire life. He won't remember that they were ""just joking"". Stand up for your friend."
775,"I would say definitely don’t stop talking about it. Talking about it is the only way things change. In terms of how to talk about it that’s trickier. You could call them out on it, but they will probably get defensive and maybe even hostile at times, depending on your relationship with them. What I generally do is try to use the Socratic method - ask people questions to kind of get them to analyze why they are doing certain things or what they are really joking about. That way they are kind of coming to their own conclusions about if they really believe the things that are at the foundation of those jokes/statements. A lot of people don’t actually have malicious or particularly sexist opinions when they actually think about it, they’ve just absorbed a lot of garbage from society and never questioned it. Sometimes I weigh in on stuff with my own opinions immediately - like someone makes a joke about something gay being weird and I’ll say “it’s not weird it’s just different.” But generally I hang back and try and talk through stuff with people unless the conversation gets to a really outrightly bigoted place.

I think it might be good to point out to your friends that they created an environment where one of your friends didn’t feel like they could come out to you, doesn’t feel like he can be himself around you guys. How that’s really sad and you don’t want to loose this guy as a friend. 

The most important thing imo though would be reaching out to your friend and letting him know that you’re there for him and support him, and that this girl is telling all his business to y’all.

I also second the recommendation of checking out r/Menslib it’s pretty dope there."
776,"> But if they don't, cut them off. It sounds harsh and possibly drastic, but if you want to actually stay true to how you've changed, that may be the only way.

This isn't always an option for people. Not to mention the fact that you can remain around someone and modulate their actions."
777,"At this point I might even start questioning whether you and your friend would be better off without these folks. I don't know the kind of impact they have on your life in other areas, but consider it."
778,"You know what, you're right. Not everyone can decide that right away,  especially if they've been friends for a long time. 

  I suppose I speak from my own experience with the advice. I did stick around to try and help with my friends when I was in this situation. But after awhile it does get exhausting trying to modulate the actions of people who just don't care to change, and at that point it was better to cut them off."
779,"If you're looking for a different perspective I've got one.  I'd go in the opposite direction you are suggesting.  Good parenting is important to kids, but having one or two parents (or three or four) or a parent of any particular gender is not the key to well raised kids.  [Here's](https://familystoryproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Case-Against-Marriage-Fundamentalism_Family-Story-Report_040419.pdf) a good rebuttal of the source you cited on these issues.

I think being a parent is something that either men or women can perform well.  They can perform the job well solo, in opposite gender couples, in same gender couples, in polyamorous networks, in platonic co-parenting arrangements.  They can parent ""biological"" children well, they can parent adopted children well.  There's nothing about being a man or a woman that makes you a better parent.

What I would suggest from a feminist perspective is we eliminate laws that stigmatize and punish solo or single parents while privileging married parents, and we eliminate gendered stigma and obstacles to make it as easy and common for men to parent children as women, in any parenting structure or arrangement that works for them."
780,"For 1) My dad spent a lot of his time fighting to keep child support low as a way of punishing mom while he made himself up to be the cool parent by getting a house and taking us on trips as kids. It created an unstable living situation for us when we weren’t on visitation with him. Having gone no contact, I believe my brother and I might have been better off with a fatherless household.

2) I think social changes would have to come first... such as having changing stations available in the men’s restrooms or expanding maternity/paternity leave policies at work. For the divorce laws themselves, starting with a greater focus on the children in the household may be the answer. Things like requiring child support to be at a level that maintains a similar standard of living in both homes, a class with a focus on single parenting, a representative/advocate for the kids, and regular check-ins with each party (like with adoptions) could help minimize trauma all around. As a kid, my dad and his lawyer regularly manipulated my brother and I in proceedings related to the divorce. I know resources are limited but I can’t help thinking more accountability would open the door for both fathers and mothers to be playing an active and care-based role rather than just present."
781,"It depends on the father.  My father became heavily into crime and drugs when I was a few years old.  I could only benefit not having him in my life.  But I grew up with an amazing mom who went back to school and got an education and became a social worker.  My childhood wasn't always easy but I was well taken care of by my mom, well loved and I had grandparents and aunts and uncles that provided me with vacations and fun outtings that my mom couldn't always afford.  

Even though my father is clean he still doesn't want to be my father as he became religious and considers me an abomination because I'm gay.

Two parents are ideal.  Even three or four as long as there is good parenting skills, with a lot of love and support for each other and the child.  But I dont think it's necessary to raise a well balanced, succesful individual.  I consider myself that.  And a bonus my mom has always been my best friend and always will be."
782,"1. &#x200B;

Maybe this perspective isn't what you were looking for, but I think that usually this problem is framed in a really misleading way.

Fundamentally, I don't think that there's any difference between what a mother and father can bring to a family, they're both smart (and hopefully empathetic) people who when needed can fulfil whatever necessary role for their childs upbringing.

It seems to me that the problem is less to do with a child being ""fatherless"" per se, then a child not having as many parents as they need.

In a society where single parents are forced to work to pay for themselves and their families, it's inevitable that one person is going to have trouble providing all of the caring and nurture that a child needs.

So, it's less to do with fathers/mothers imo, and more to do with a sheer lack of parental time.

2)It seems reasonable to me that (up to the childs discretion), in a divorce all parents should have a good amount of access to the child. I wouldn't be able to say much about this though, I'm not at all versed in divorce law."
783,"Fatherless homes can be just fine, same as motherless homes.  It depends on the financial situation of the family, the social support system around the family, the individual situation of the parent and to what extent they are in a good position to raise children.  I don’t think there is anything essential to men that makes them ‘naturally’ worse parents than women. 

Now, they may be less trained to provide child care roles — from a young age girls are encouraged to think about how to take care of a child.  They are given toys that resemble infants, they are encouraged to get involved in household chores, given jobs babysitting, helping with children in Sunday Schools and summer camps, etc.  So by adulthood and parenthood a woman may have had more ‘practice’ at taking care of kids.  This may create the illusion that women are just better, but it’s that a lot of work went into their skill. 

It isn’t divorce and parenting laws that need to be reformed - there is no law that says women get custody more, and not sure what you mean by parenting laws.  What I think needs to change is being more equal in how we prepare people for child raising.  There needs to be as much emphasis on knowing child care for men as thereis for women, and we could do better encouraging men to consider what will give them the best chance to physically care for their child while financially contributing to their family when they think about their career choices.  

I could go on at length why I think the call for default shared custody is the event of a divorce is, while well intentioned, perhaps a bit misguided, but this has been long enough."
784,"I think two parent households (whether they be one mother one father/ two fathers/ two mothers) are important for a variety of reasons. 

Not only because the more people that love and support a developing mind is always better, but because parents need support from each other as well. 

I’m not just talking about monetary support. 

Emotional and mental support is even more important imo."
785,"We already reformed divorce laws specifically to make it easier for women to leave abusive spouses. We absolutely should not tamper with this law in anyway that could end up trapping someone in an abusive relationship.

If people want to get divorced, they should, be ause that usually means there were quite a few issues going on and they will no longer be able to support one another in a healthy way. And any child of theirs will grow up feeling the tension, fearful that abuse will turn towards them, or just confused that they had to saty with two people who dislike each other and made the child's life uncomfortable and unhealthy.

Two or more loving parents is ideal. Gender doesn't matter so much. However, if you have two parents that constantly fight you will grow up in a dysfunctional system and often wish your parents had divorced so that your life wouldn't include so much toxicity and anger and resentment. 

And let's remember, children tend to model their relationship after what they see their parents do. A child expose to a lot of screaming and hitting is very likely to continue the cycle in their own relationships (you can look up the cycle of abuse as this is pretty well studied). So no, it's not always worse to be raised by one parent, if that parent is loving and supportive and the other parent was not. Or if both parents together caused a lot of conflict."
786,"I grew up in a motherless home for the most part. Without getting too in-depth, I was raised by my father, my relationship with my mother strained and almost non-existent most times.

This is not the norm, because mostly, women give birth, have custody, and raise children while the father has more access to an “escape” route so-to-speak. That said, I still suggest two parent households. Not because fathers should have a set and specific “role”, but because having two parents is healthier for a child overall. 

To answer your questions, however...

1. I think fathers have the potential to be just as important as mothers, but there are a lot of contributing factors here. Is the father abusive towards the mother? Child? Then, I’d say that it would be better that he stays away. I’d say the same if the roles were reversed as well. 

2. We shouldn’t be looking at divorce courts and custody courts to “reward” fathers who stay with their children. Truth of the matter is that a lot of absent fathers just don’t want to be fathers and don’t file for custody, or try and gain. I think looking at the value we place on parents overall is something that needs to be done. We already undervalue mothers, especially single mothers. Sure, there are empty praises of strength and such, but let’s be real, it’s a condescending pat on the head most times.

The concept of gender and parenting isn’t really a factor here, though. I would suggest, if possible, two parent households... if that consists of man/woman, man/man, woman/woman, it’s good enough. It’s better on the child to have two parents, it doesn’t really matter if one is a guy, one is a woman, one is non-binary, or both are the same gender."
787,"1. Both (or all) parents have an important role to play in their children's life, but I don't think there is anything magical about the role of ""father"" per se. Kids usually do better with two (or more) loving parents. Single parents, who are usually single mothers, will usually have fewer resources (from time to money) and that's what can have negative impacts for children. Children also suffer if there is unhealthy conflict between parents. Two mothers, two fathers, or a single parent who is able to arrange for significant resources to be available to the child through other means all lead to positive outcomes for children. 

2. In my view, parents rights are and should be secondary to children's rights when it comes to divorce and/or care arrangements for children. Children's welfare is paramount, and in most cases at least some/equal contact with both parents is best for the children. If divorce laws are to be changed, I'd want to see them change such that children are centred, which I do not believe is currently the case. 

As far as increasing the proportion of men who have regular contact with their children after divorce, the legal side has little to do with it. The primary reason men don't get custody is that they don't seek it. We need social change to overcome that (with some legal remedies such as mandatory paid parental leave for both parents)."
788,"Yes, most definitely.  I see your points here and I appreciate how well lined up your thought process is.  I agree with much of what you said. I guess I should have specified, I had already thought of the different parenting dynamics that could take place among parents of varying sexuality and orientation.  I guess, more specifically, how important do you think it is for a child to grow up with two or possibly more parents with different mindsets and approaches to life?  For myself and many of my friends who have been lucky enough to have this,it has been very beneficial and we all agree.  Whether it be from a gay couple or some other arrangement, do you agree that that is an important part of growing up, to be mentored from different perspectives?"
789,"These are very good points, I think that’s awesome how your mom was able to do that.  Truly awesome.  Completely okay if you don’t answer this one but I’m just a curious individual tonight with nothing better to do.  Did your mom, grandparents, aunts and uncles, ever alienate your father?  Tell unpleasant stories or highlight his bad qualities to you?  If so, how did this alter your perspective toward your father?  Did it affect you?"
790,"Actually, that is the exact perspective I was hoping for.  So you believe that no matter the circumstances, it’s better for a child to grow up with more than one parent?  Regardless if it’s two mothers or two fathers or even more.
Also, you may not be well enough equipped to answer this question but I’m gonna shoot anyway:  No matter the sexual orientation or arrangement between separated parents, how big of a role do you think parental alienation between parents plays into a youths ability to grow into a successful person?  I may be mistaken, but it almost seems as if this is a factor that could play into children growing up with single parents, turning toward more unsavory paths of life such as crime and drug addiction.  If a child’s brain has been poisoned with propaganda making one of their parents out to be a bad person, it could taint their view of more than just that person.  I would think that more than anything plays into a child’s perspective on life and their all around surroundings.  I appreciate the discussion."
791,"I'm adopted - It's why if I don't marry, I'll fund an orphanage or something, rather than single-parent adopt."
792,"I agree completely.  Now I’m going to ask a more difficult question because I’m bored and enjoy conversing with level headed people such as yourself.  Do you think that regardless the number of parents in the household, do you also believe that it is important for parents to offer differing opinions and perspectives toward life when raising a child?  It seems to me, that if a child were to have two incredibly like minded parents who never open the child’s mind to discussion from different viewpoints, it would negatively affect the child in the long run.  For example, if both parents were vehemently against something and never stimulated the child to see how some people could enjoy what the parents hate, wouldn’t that be detrimental to a child’s sense of empathy as well as their ability to have open discussions with people they may not get along with?"
793,"I agree with the majority of the points you brought up.  However, I disagree with your portion on the divorce courts.  I never said, nor do I believe that fathers should be rewarded for sticking around.  Although it is true that many men are not fit for fatherhood nor do they want fatherhood, from what I have read, it is definitely not the majority.  Divorce courts almost always favor mothers, I do believe that there could and should be reforms made to make it easier for fathers who want to stay in their kids lives to do just that.  My uncle was unfortunately a victim of this.  My aunt won full custody initially because she had made up false allegations against my uncle claiming he was unfit to be alone with kids with no proof and the court had believed her.  Two years down the road, my uncle uncovered a bit of information from his son(my cousin) that actually led to my ex-aunt losing custody in totality and she has now been deemed by the state as an unfit mother.  This is most certainly not the norm but I have also heard of this happening between same sex couples.  Do you not think that there needs to be change in the court system to objectively evaluate the ability to parent so that situations don’t arise where a parent wants to be present in their child’s life but can’t because the court won’t let them?"
794,"My view is it's not particularly important for a child to have two parents specifically for a few reasons.  To your point about perspectives, as they say it takes a village, and no child being raised today is influenced by just one or two parents -- childcare, schooling, and teachers play a huge role in children's development and ensure a diversity of perspectives.  Solo parents might have friends and relatives that assume the ""aunt or uncle"" role and can also give a child different life lessons.  So a child is going to get a lot of different input in life no matter how many legally specially-designated ""parents"" he has.

There are other reasons I have for this view outlined in my link which bust the resource myths of one parent vs. two.  But aside from that, a common assumption when we think that two parents are often better comes from those of us who had good experiences with two parents and the perspectives they imparted.  Having those kinds of parents makes one very privileged and lucky in life, but they are not the norm for most people.  If you have two parents with crappy perspectives who are always fighting with each other and have a gendered division of labor within the household, most children would have been much better off with one parent.   So it's fair to ask whether there is a problem with the institution of the romantic parent coupled norm that makes many of them work badly.  A fifty percent (or less) success rate is hardly a ringing endorsement for the future of a child-raising structure -- even if it is awesome being one of the lucky ones who grew up with upper-tier parents."
795,"I don’t think children of single parents are necessarily more likely to turn toward “more unsavory paths of life such as crime and drug addiction” due to being in a single parent home (if at all).  If they are more likely to do those things, it’s more likely the fault of poverty.  A wealthy single-parent can afford help—nannies, tutors, housekeepers—making them more available to the child.  A poor single parent can sometimes not afford food.  And so that child might turn to “crime” to feed themselves and/or their parent."
796,"Parents aren’t the only place that children can see healthy disagreement modeled.  But it’s very unlikely in a two or more parent home for all the adults to agree constantly.  And they are exposed to all sorts of different things in pre-school and k12 and at their friends houses.  

I think your questions are working from the assumption that all of a child’s socialization comes from parents.  It doesn’t."
797,"Let’s get down to it, then.

Fact: Most women get custody of children.

Okay, why? What does the data say?

Well, most of it states that as well as gender roles, men are not seeking custody (91% of divorces don’t even involve custody court) or agreeing that a child is best with their mother. 

So how, with the data, do you think that should be fixed? *Why* are men not going for custody?

We can’t ignore the data, here. We can’t just take the claim “women primarily get custody of children” without investigation why that might be. Since the data not only mentions that women are more likely to be spending more time with their children even while married, leaning towards a favour of said mother, it also mentions that men aren’t asking for it.

So the question is here: how can we get more men interested in parenting? 

It does no good to ignore what the data is saying in favour of your own explanation bias."
798,"Well, it can be. For example, for a long time it was common practice to use “he” and “his” to mean “anyone.” For example: “if a voter wishes to cast his vote by mail, he must obtain a mail-in ballot.” It wasn’t considered necessary to specifically acknowledge women’s presence in the audience of written or spoken speech — women were just expected to decide when “he” and “his” also included them and when the speaker was actually only speaking to or about men. Mostly the use of these words *reveals* sexism, racism, or classism that is already present, but of course these usages also continue to reinforce them. 

This is why the singular “they” is becoming so much more accepted in general English language use."
799,"It’s not exactly the claim you’re making, but if I’m not mistaken, I saw someone post [this comic](https://www.democraticunderground.com/10027167539) here a while back, and it does briefly mention how dictionaries of speech have been primarily written by straight white men, and how they aren’t truly as “neutral” as we like to think they are."
800,"“Grammar is racist” is an insultingly reductionist version of the argument that African-American Vernacular English is a valid and internally consistent vernacular and that its sentence construction shouldn’t be seen as incorrect, just different from standard American English."
801,"Not inherently no, but some people do us grammar pedantically as a way to police and/or discredit women and people of color."
802,Grammar and language are a reflection of society. They aren't inherently anything.
803,Ah well then it’s good that it’s been changed to have they then!
804,"Ah I see, thank you for the link but is it racist?"
805,So grammar isn’t racist then? That’s good because it’s not. And yeah I agree with how it should be seen as a different standard and all
806,Ohhh I See! That sucks that people do that though
807,"Ah, makes sense too!"
808,"You’re looking for a binary answer here, and I’m sorry to tell you that nothing works that way. Is it racist? Not necessarily, but the criticism of it can absolutely used as thinly veiled racism."
809,"Grammar isn't racist, but criticism of particular grammatical constructs can result from racial bias. Nobody is saying 'black people say that so it must be wrong', it's more implicit. If you're from a white community, only interact with other white people, and only see white vernacular represented in the media, you might be led to believe that particular characteristics of English spoken in African-American communities are 'wrong', because they're different from what you're used to. But this is false, because there is no such thing as 'right' or 'wrong' use of a language, as long as you manage to communicate. Considering African-American vernacular 'wrong' is just as misguided as calling British English 'wrong' - it's not, and an American accent sounds strange to British ears.

The point about sexism in grammar is a slightly different one, and not as important in English. Many other languages, including Spanish, French and German, use gendered nouns, and adjectives. When you refer to people, the default is usually male. A group of Latin American people would be referred to as Latinos, even if it were made up of nine Latina women and a single Latino man. This is why, in the English-speaking literature, some people have adopted the gender-neutral term 'Latinx'."
810,Grammar Nazi's tend towards racism and sexism in their grammar.

814,"Just as a historical fun-fact, there were feminists in the Middle East and other parts of the Muslim world in the 19th century as well as Europe.

822,"I don't get why people underestimate it either. Wiki is good for a first ""look for bibliography"" attempt. Then you can dig and check if it is true or not, but it is always a good first iteration for information seed."
823,"I’ll give you my own personal explanation. When it first came out we still existed in a “trust nothing on the internet” stage combined with HS and colleges being very strict about not using Wiki. It was easier for crazy stuff to slip in for a day or two before getting noticed. And it was new.

At some point, it may have been when I went back to college about a decade ago, it had started to shift. Wiki was now a great place to get an introductory explanation for a new topic (or a review for a topic you haven’t thought about since elementary) and provides a platform to begin your own research. But if I hadn’t gone back to college at the right time, I’d still think of it like I did before.

Also I refuse to let go of my “don’t trust anything on the internet”. Unless it’s a news source from a trusted provider or research in a vetted paper. Makes it easier to not get taken by fake news as I have to prove it’s true before I accept it."

826,"""you women"" 🙄

Most feminists-- myself included-- would like to see a comprehensive men's movement that actually helped men and focused on finding real solutions for their issues, instead of being dedicated to finding the worst woman in the world and blaming women and feminism for all their problems. We generally recommend /r/MensLib here."
827,">I've seen that men have started fighting for their own rights now,

The mens liberation movement has existed for decades. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_liberation_movement

Fighting for mens issues is not, nor has it ever been in opposition to feminism. In fact, the reason the popularity of the mens liberation movement died off is because their cause was adapted into much of mainstream feminist thought.

>just like you women fight for equality. What do you think about this?

Not all feminists are women."
828,"Largely unnecessary. 

You say ""you women"" but you dont actually have to identify as a woman to be a feminist, and feminism doesnt actually solely focus on women's rights.

Men (like me) are welcome to create our own spaces within feminism to focus on mens issues, and many feminist platforms involve men and addressing mens issues.

Movements focusing on men are fine but they dont have to come up with another name for themselves besides feminists. They're already included under the umbrella."
829,"> men have started fighting for their own rights now 

This is kind of a funny way to frame it. 

I support men pushing back against gender roles and expectations; women can't be the ones doing all the work on that front. I don't support hateful shit like Men's Rights."
830,"Good, y'all have some work to do. Just make sure you're not blaming women/feminists for your problems. If your solutions are ""women should go back into the kitchen"" you're doing it wrong."
831,"I’m mostly for r/menslib, despite some of the iffy things I’ve seen from their users and mods. Truth be told, it’ll take a while, and a lot of trial and error to fully get a men’s group in a healthy place.

Overall, though, I support men having a safe space to air their issues."
832,"I think they do have their points, but unfortunately it is a very toxic community.

But yeah, they do have some points that need to be addressed just as much as the feminist movement, although they fail to see what feminism really is. 

But overall, to say men are oppressed is a bit of an overstatement. There is a difference between a few bits of discrimination and oppression."
833,"What hurts men the most is the hatred and irrational fear of all things so-called feminine.  Men go to such extreme to stop the so-called feminization of men that they are willing to self destruct emotionally and physically.  And in the process destroy everything in their path.  The only right I see men's groups fight for is to keep it socially acceptable to hate women and minorities.  They're nothing like feminists and have done zero to better the quality of lives of men.  They would rather try to keep men irrational, angry and ignorant."
834,"The ridiculousness of starting a mens rights movement always shocks me. As a man myself I can fully understand that social issues men face are largely an issue of the Patriarchy. Mens groups like these seem to always focus on ideas like 'more men commit suicide than women' and just focus on stats that prove that 'men have it worse of', this may be true but the issue lies deeper as to why this is i.e. Financial burdens - possibly due to Patriarchal ideas of men having to be the breadwinner, or struggling with mental health - again Patriarchal ideas of men not being able to show emotion. These are, albeit simple, ideas of mens struggles but prove that it all links to a basic feminist idea of Patriarchal superiority. 

All in all I think it's dumb when men start a whole separate movement (just branch from basic feminism instead), I can understand the necessity as struggles are not always exact but they seem to always end up attacking feminist movements."
835,Came here to say this.
836,agreed!! i hate it when people separate feminism and “men’s issues” bc men’s issues are largely caused by patriarchy which feminism aims to dismantle lmao. feminism literally means equality of tha genders idk word so hard about it for some ppl
837,"I’m not a feminist but also not part of the “feminism is bad” side either. I understand the point of your post but a men’s movement within feminism seems counterintuitive. Isn’t the core of feminism focused on bringing up women? Hence the name. If your movement is about men and women it probably makes sense to brand it under something other than one genders label. If it truly is focused on women, which is okay, then why not have a separate men’s movement as well? The whole “men are included in the feminist movement” is odd."

Then you are not looking.

There are men's groups fighting for father's rights to see their children; for the right to bodily autonomy in the face of genital mutilation; for the right to have domestic violence shelters; for the right to have mental health support; for the right to have prostate cancer research financed; for the right to be treated equal when it comes to selective service; for the right to a fair trial in Title IX cases; and the list goes on."
843,"Maybe it seems obvious to you if you are wrapped into the movement. The majority of people who aren’t involved think of it as a women’s movement, hell the name feminism ties in with a focus on women. To act like it’s crazy that people tie feminism in with a women’s movement seems disconnected."
844,Pretty hard to challenge gender roles for women without challenging gender roles for men and vice versa.
845,"My question is why would a men’s movement want to consciously not call itself also feminist?  Maybe major points of feminist activism aren’t the main focus, but I tend to be suspicious of a men’s group that goes out of its way to say ‘we aren’t feminist’.  A lot of groups that are helping men have been started by feminists - the Innocence Project, Just Detention are two I am familiar with.  Now, neither of them make the ‘stereotypical’ feminist activist issues their main focus, but they don’t distance themselves either."
846,"I‘ve seen even mods call women discussing their systemic issues “just venting” almost as if we’re discussing small things and shouldn’t be listened to, which is worrying.

There could also be group that largely focuses on men’s issues but supports and helps with women’s issues as well. The bulk of men’s rights movement at the moment are shitty, but hopefully they’ll evolve upward and support women’s movements as well."
854,"Yeah if men’s groups are specifically saying they don’t support women’s rights, the definition of feminism, then they’re assholes. I think the bigger point is that it should be okay and acceptable to have both women’s and men’s groups. Ideally both sides should support each other but that’s a different conversation than was asked. I think it is okay for there to be mens movements along with womens movements."
855,"> My question is why would a men’s movement want to consciously not call itself also feminist?

Because they may not agree with the feminist narrative? Because they see a lot of feminist lobbyists going against men's issues? Because there is a lot of misandry accepted within feminism? Because the feminist movement ostracizes egalitarian activists such as Erin Pizzey, Warren Farrell, and Cassie Jaye?"
856,"The post this week asking ""Is male sexuality demonized?"" (already an obnoxious old MRA talking point that I remember from several years back) was really frustrating - lots of guys making sweeping statements implying that women's sexuality is accepted and celebrated, plus the whole post premise of ignoring queer and trans men completely. And the mods just let it go. 

Don't even get me started on how TITRCJ reacts toward women in that sub.

I still have a generally favorable view toward it - especially in comparison to the rest of Reddit - but its potential can make its shortcomings even more frustrating sometimes."
857,Not sure what was funny about my post.
858,"Women's groups also often become men-hating groups, so your argument is pointless."
859,Thanks! Comment is restored.
860,Im curious what you mean by society hates women overall. Do you mean things like the pay gap?
861,">That makes perfect sense but largely feminism is focused on women, would you agree with that? 

It's irrelevant. Breaking down gender roles for women equally breaks down those roles for men. If two people are shackled to the same 50 lb weight, and I remove the weight, both people benefit, it doesn't really matter what label is put on the process."
862,"You started in your first post by saying «I am not a feminist».
But here you define feminism as the support for womens rights. 
So is the logic here that you don’t support womens rights? 
I  think you actually are a feminist but you don’t want to be identified with the lable. 

It is great with organizations that focuses on issues that affect mostly men, but I don’t see why this has to be put up against feminism as something that contrasts feminism when both want exactly the same thing. A world where your gender doesn’t hold you back. 

Feminism isn’t the reason why men die more often at work, or the reason why they get the short end of the stick when it comes to who the court thinks is the best parent to have the child after divorces for example. Those problems come from old views that say women should stay home with kids and men should go out and be tough. Feminists fight against those views.

These organizations have potential to be great input in the fight for equality but often (with some exceptions) I unfortunately see them end up hating on women and not really working towards solving the problems they claim to be working towards."
863,I have never seen any serious feminist objection to groups working on issues predominantly facing men so long as they aren’t anti-feminist.
864,">Because the feminist movement ostracizes egalitarian activists such as Erin Pizzey, Warren Farrell, and Cassie Jaye?

In addition to what JulieCrone says: Erin Pizzey accused feminists of doing heinous things to her with no evidence. Warren Farrell is a piece of shit who compares a woman not fucking after a date to *date rape*. Cassie Jaye made a movie sympathetic toward a misogynist hate group.

Shunning people who do that shit isn't misandry. I have no interest in joining hands with someone who promotes my dehumanization and actively works against my rights."
865,"Well, Erin Pizzey has made a lot of statements on the dynamics of domestic violence that she isn’t really qualified to make — she has no background in psychology, sociology, or any kind of research discipline that would give her a frame work for studying the issue.  I know she had a very abusive mother and a very hard childhood and I have great sympathy for her and respect for a lot of her activism, but she is not someone I would turn to for an expert opinion and I disagree with her trying to put herself out as an expert. 

With Farrell, how much have you read of his work and how much do you know about his background? 

Regarding Cassie Jaye, you may want to see these:

https://youtu.be/P0dwWLY3SyY

Further, I would question this idea of a ‘feminist narrative’.  There are a lot of feminists I disagree with: Germaine Greer, Meghan Murphy, and Julie Bindel to name just a few.  

I don’t see feminists going against men’s issues.  We have supported being included in the draft, we tend to support justice reform, work place safety, free access to mental health services, equal family leave, etc.  Yeah, some shared parenting bills we object to because they don’t do anything to protect spouses who are victims of domestic abuse that doesn’t meet the legal standard of criminal assault.  This impacts men too, as men are victims of domestic abuse too, even if that assault doesn’t meet the standard of criminal assault.  Virginia’s law where shared custody is to be considered but isn’t mandated is a good one feminists supported."
866,"I absolutely agree. I think part of it, too,  is that I expect better from them? Kind of how internalized misogyny almost disappoints me more than regular old misogyny. So close, yet so far. Sometimes it seems like they’re getting to good points, other times it seems like they’re using “feminist theory” to virtue signal and, yet again, paint women as celebrated while the poor men are the truly oppressed.

As Frye said, “The word ‘oppression’ is a strong word. It repels and attracts. It is dangerous and dangerously fashionable and endangered. It is much misused, and sometimes not innocently.” Along with her other statement, “Human beings can be miserable without being oppressed, and it is perfectly consistent to deny that a person or group is oppressed without denying that they have feelings or that they suffer.”

I feel like honestly, they actually need to only have mods who are actual avid feminists and actually know feminist theory, or at the very least, have the major mods educated with it. Because if they don’t want the space to become another MRA-esque echo chamber, and want to actually practice the claim of “pro-feminist” like they advertise, they actually need to put it to practice.

And no, no one is a perfect feminist, but it seems like the bare-minimum is applied here."
867,"Not the person who asked on menslib, asked a question about this here like months back, I don't think the idea that male sexuality is demonized is just an MRA talking point. Women's sexuality may not be accepted and celebrated but it isn't seen as inherently predatory or wrong like men's sexuality. Taking a look over the thread, that seems to be most of what they're discussing as well, and very few people are painting the rosy view of women's sexuality you're accusing them of having.

Idk, kinda sad to see that folks here have a dim view of r/menslib, really does feed into the frustrations I see expressed there from time to time with the idea that men's liberation groups have to be chaperoned by feminists to be legitimate. Men should be allowed to start their own groups without being held to the standard of actively practicing and preaching feminism and being governed by feminist theory. Feminists often, and should tell men that they should be advocating for themselves instead of pushing that responsibility on to women. But that also means giving up control of men's liberation movements, they can't have both no responsibility and full control. Ya'll gotta sit back at some point, people are posting in this thread about how the men's liberation movement has been around for decades. Its grown now.

Edit: Lemme try that again in a post-""procrastinating on an LGBT History assignment"" headspace. I've been sitting around here watching you all work for a few weeks, what you all do is fantastic. You all promote amazing discussions about feminism. However, I've been sitting around here for a while, and I've noticed something that's been bugging me: feminists talk a big game about supporting men's issues, but they don't do it because they want to. Feminists seem to support men's issues only because if they maintain control over discussions of men's issues, they may be able to change men in such a way that neutralizes their threat to women. To an extent I don't have an issue with feminists participating in the men's liberation movement just because they feel the need to do so in order to make men less of a threat to women. I just wish they'd be up front about it and know when to step back. This discussion of the demonization of men's sexuality was an honest discussion between men who want to become more open about their sexuality and gather various viewpoints, and the feminist criticism seemed to be that that didn't reflect feminist theory well enough. Guys, feminist theory is great, but like, this was one for the boys. Like, am I wrong? The way men are socialized is an active threat to women, women want to change that, but if feminist participation in men's lib begins and ends at ""how do we make men not pent up bottles of rage and insecurity so that they don't harm women?"" then helping men is a byproduct, not a goal. And that's fine, we shouldn't be pushing the burden of men's liberation on women, and you all did what you could for us while you needed to focus on women's issues. My question is, why do you want the helm back?

I've seen some wild claims on this thread, like the idea that men's lib died because everyone realized that they could just take up the mantle of feminism. I've seen the idea that men's issues groups are unnecessary due to feminism be used to deny funding to men's groups in real life. I just don't get it, it really does feel like you all at some point wanted men to take ownership of men's lib, then got nervous when you saw men discussing their issues with eachother, understandably, because you were afraid that those discussions could morph into something harmful to women.

But instead of trusting men to discuss their issues and putting the good faith in men that you talk about whenever one of you calmly and elegantly responds to an whiny MRA, saying, ""I believe that men can do better than this for themselves,"" you all were like, ""ok, you're done driving the social conciousness car, we want the wheel back."" I'm not the only one who feels this, the tension has been palpable for a while. I've seen discussions about this on menslib. Folks are starting to question whether the women who want to be seen as fully human by a patriarchal society see the men trying to free themselves from the confines of the patriarchy, men who may not know the meaning of the words  'patriarchy' or 'hegemonic masculinity' but are tired of conforming to harmful gender roles, as fully human. Do you see us as *your* equals, or do you see men as dangerous creatures who have to be trained and controlled for the safety of women? Do you want to see men's issues groups, or groups that show how well you've trained those creatures by spouting feminist theory the loudest? 

These are genuine questions. If you're responding to this, please do think about them before you say anything. I'm just speaking my mind and hoping I'm not right, because if I'm right then I don't know what to say. If this is the last time I see you all, thank you so much for all you've shown me and all the help you've given. I truly do hope that you all are proud of the wonderful, educational community you've created here, and I wish you all good luck on your mission to help people achieve a better understanding of feminism."
868,"Oh, sorry, I just giggle really hard at obvious bait dangles. They’re funny to me."
869,okay
870,"Not the person who you were replying to, but I see it as the devaluation of anything feminine as ""less than."" One example would be with young kids-- if a little girl wants to run and climb trees and be loud and messy, it's cute and she's a tomboy, but if a little boy wants to paint his nails and play with dolls, everybody freaks out. Or the idea that female-dominated hobbies are all stupid and superficial, but men's hobbies are important intellectual pursuits."
871,So we agree? Men and women should have group supporting the specific issues each of them face? Outside of the question asked I think we also agree that they should support each other. At at the end of the day we all need each other’s support to make the kind of changes that are needed
872,"I don't know, maybe as a gay black guy I'm not being fair, but I feel like menslib is full of white guys really out of touch with reality when it comes not only to women's issues but also race issues.  The two main threads I read on race issues was basically only complaining about white women.  And as a black man that is really insulting.  White women didn't kidnap, enslave and murder millions of Africans.  They also never talk about the white male campaign of rape and terror they perpratrated against black women.  That still goes on today.  They may be a little better than most men's groups but their dealings with the race issue really turns me off."
873,"oh god. just, yes to all of this. i've been thinking everything in this thread so hard and wondering if i was alone."
874,"I don't see guys on men'slib claiming that they are oppressed but I think the problem is feminist perspective sees men as oppressors and women the oppressed, so the experiences and perspectives of men are dismissed if they aren't in harmony with mainstream feminist theory.  Mainstream feminist theory was never about men in the first place.  They are pioneers over there forging a whole new path that has never been explored within feminism. Men are not allowed to vent without being problematic, yet the opposite is not true."
875,"I’ll respond. And before I do, thank you for taking your time to type all this out. Since I kinda brought up the issue in the first place, I’ll try to respond best I can. I do tend to type very blunt and use words that may come off hostile sometimes, so please note that I will try my hardest with my tone to not come off attacking, and even pre-edit before sending, but if something slips through the cracks, know this: I’m not here to dismiss your concerns, but I will be trying to give my view on these things, and not beat around the bush about it.

1) Men’s Sexuality - The issue with men’s sexuality (which, we’re going to talk about heterosexual sexuality, since gay and bisexual was glossed over in the original thread) being seen as predatory is because for a very long time, it has been. Let’s not beat around the bush here. There was a guy who came in, not two days ago, claiming that men should be able to create deep fakes of any woman he desired in order to beat off to her. He claimed that jerking off to friends social media pictures is in no way creepy, and ignored every single woman’s (and men’s, and nb’s) protest about it. To him, “consent” only matters in one area, one that leads to physical rape, other than that, men should have free range of the world to use as his fap folder.

Lesbians and bisexual women are being sexualized at a crazy rate, if not “raped straight”. Fat women are being called “BBW” as if they’re a porn label and not an actual human, that is, when they’re not being told they’re disgusting and need to hide themselves until they approve of the number on the scale. Trans women are being called “traps” and “seductresses” because of how they were born, and are often hyper-sexualized. Straight men, very often, see women as either “items to fap to” or “ignorable”— and this *is* an issue. 

In what way, would a healthy men’s group, ignore these issues? Why are they, instead, comparing women’s sexuality and men’s sexuality while ignoring the fact that other men have abused male sexuality? Why are they not going to the root of the problem to call their friends and peers out on this creepy behavior? At this rate, claiming that male sexuality shouldn’t be seen as predatory in any light, is telling women to let their guard down and trust random people after having numerous bad experiences with them their whole lives.

Women’s Sexuality - You’re right, we’re not praised. But let’s stop acting as if even our common kinks and tropes are celebrated as healthy. Submissive women often are targeted for not only abuse, but they’re seen as weak people outright. “you mean they *choose* to willingly give up control??” While, I am in no way advocating for 50 Shades of Grey, *trust me*, it does no good to completely ignore that a good deal of women we’re into it— and that society as a whole laughed at them for it. Memes were made, claims of finding dildos and vegetables in movie theatres. We hate what women like. We hate and mock bands and musicians women like, we hate and mock books women like, movies, hobbies, and functions. That doesn’t change for our sexuality. A lot of women read erotic fiction, or fanfiction with tons of sex in it, and it’s mocked. How cute, how disgusting, why would they chose that? Pathetic. 

All this while not even touching on being called whores, hoes, thots, prudes, teases, so on and so forth— because I think you already know about that. That said, there are issues with sexuality on all sides, but if men want to talk about male sexuality being seen as predatory— they need to discuss *why*, and then they can get to how to fix it in a healthy way.

2. Making a Men’s Group

Yes, we’re going to advocate making a men’s group for men in a healthy space, but not at the expense of women. To act as if men haven’t made “groups” before, like MRA, MGTOW, the pills, inceldom— there’s a reason we took issue with these. Number one, they’re not based on any factual gender sciences. Number two, they’re stepping on the faces of women, stomping them into the dirt, and posing themselves as the “truly oppressed”. 

You cannot care for one gender while completely ignoring another, which brings me to...

3. “Feminists talk a big game about helping men but don’t actually do it” — paraphrased, but that’s the gist? It’s an unfounded claim. In fact, there’s an entire document created that outlines what feminism has done for men, and you... just want to ignore it? The issue is that we can only do so much, until men need to take over and change the things that women do not have the ability to. That doesn’t mean that our issues should be ignored, and teachings should be thrown out. Gender studies is mostly geared towards women because women need the most work, and ignoring that and saying “I’m only gonna focus on men and ignore the issues of women” when the issues are VERY commonly intertwined is something that catapults a group into MRA territory. Feminists have not, ever, discounted men. At least... well, intersectional feminists, I can’t speak on *other groups that may not be named*. 

I cannot focus on women’s issues while ignoring the issues black women go through, trans women, disabled women, fat women— which inevitably ties into issues that gay men, trans men, “feminine” men go through. You cannot bring gender equality, by ignoring the issues of half the population. It just doesn’t work that way, and that’s why exclusionary groups are so stunted or behind overall. 

No one is saying make a group all about women. Absolutely focus on men’s issues, but there’s no reason to IGNORE women’s issues while focusing on men’s issues is my point, and by trying to compare “women are so great in this area” while not even asking women’s experience? That’s what MRAs do, and you’re better than that."
876,"No idea what you're talking about. The response I made was genuine and sincere. 

Please visit realsexism.com if you want to get an education past some feminist website. Good day."
877,"They’re not wrong. Gender critical is a mostly women space and they fucking hate men. FDS also pretty much hates men.


Before TwoX hit default status, it was more of a girls club and they didn’t like men very much. There are more examples. Would you like me to list more? Becoming a toxic femcel works the same way as becoming a toxic male incel, in fact the term “incel” was coined by a woman...


Okay?"
878,"Hell, when people want to denounce men, what do they call them? Either gay slurs (which, gay men are often clumped with women or “woman-like”) or slurs they use for women."
879,"Well, I don’t see why they need to be separate based on gender.  Just Detention, a group that works on ending sexual violence in prisons, isn’t exclusively men though it may predominantly work for men, just like  RAINN isn’t just about women.   Just Detention doesn’t hide from being feminist, even if the primary focus of its work isn’t women."
880,"I think this is a legitimate concern. I like MensLib, but I don’t think it’s perfect — but I also subscribe to the philosophy of “don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” That is, they are trying to make steps in the right direction. Sometimes they don’t get it all right. I understand how frustrating that can be, and I’m not trying to minimize that. But I believe in their overall goodwill and I think that with repeated reminders to consider viewpoints that don’t belong to straight white cis guys, they can get there. Feminism has also struggled with that, and continues to struggle with it in some areas, but we believe in the overall mission. I think we have to look at all of these things (including feminism) as works in progress — *constant* progress."
881,"Lol, I just had a notification that linked my original comment in this thread that said “women are upset that menslib isn’t all about women”, but it disappeared.

Imagine thinking that criticizing a group that prides itself on being “pro feminist” while not sticking to that ideal is the same thing as “complaining that it isn’t about women”, smh."
882,"
Saying things like “Men are not allowed to vent without being problematic” and “Men’s sexuality is demonized and Women’s is celebrated” isn’t a problem of venting— they’re false statements, and absolutely hinging on “Men can’t , Women can.”

The issue is not mainstream feminist theory, because even most feminists aren’t all on board with all aspects of mainstream feminist theory. The issue is ignoring that, despite men having problems in it, it is a man’s world and groups like this still need to recognize that rather than ignore it. Are we forgetting that women having feelings lead to things like hysteria happening, and even to this day, we get called names like “femn*zi, b*tch, c*nt? Are we forgetting that even if we cry, we’re often called over-dramatic, attention-seeking, manipulative? 

Do you think people would have stuck up for Christine Ford if she would have acted the way Brett did during those hearings? Because I can tell you from personal and non-personal viewing experience, it would have gone down entirely different if she weren’t able to keep herself composed.

Do you think that feminism, a group of people fighting for women, even to this day are still treated with respect? Because we’re not. Not by a long shot. 

Saying “women can and we can’t” is a roundabout way of saying “we are oppressed, and they are privileged” without using those exact same words.

The point is that, you can talk about the sufferings of men, without putting down our issues, or ignoring them entirely. That’s not what’s going on in these instances. It’s slowly starting to silence women. Like I said, it is better than most places, absolutely, but something feminism has done is still take men’s issues into account. The majority of us (cause there are still some problems) still welcome men in our spaces, especially if they don’t fit society’s ideal of being men, which is why a lot of our feminist men think making a group like menslib is pointless... we still recognize toxic masculinity, and in fact, have championed to have it demolished forever, along with gender roles.

The reason feminism includes men’s issues is because you cannot fight for women and not fight for the issues men face. Men *should* have a space for themselves so they can be around other men who aren’t toxic, but beginning to steer against the entirety of feminist theory, and ignoring women when they speak about their issues of oppression— all while preaching feminism alignment turns into virtue signaling, because speaking over women and making false claims while explicitly ignoring the oppressed, is not feminist. It’s just not. 

You can talk about your issues, without stepping on the heads of women is my point. Having a men’s group to celebrate men is fantastic, having a men’s group talk over women and ignore their issues in favour of a false talking point, isn’t."
883,"First, thank you for putting a whole lot of effort into your response. I see someone came here before me, not sure what they said, seems like they tried to use their knowledge of feminist theory to push their non-feminist views. I don't want to do that so I'm going to try to clarify something right now: If I drop some words related to gender studies or feminist theory in what I'm about to say, it's because I'm in a course right now where we have to use that language regularly planning an essay, so it's kinda fresh. I'll try not to abuse what little I've got to pull one over on you all, you all know more about this than I ever will and I recognize that. I have genuine respect for ya'll's intelligence. I try to use bigger words when I'm arguing on the internet because I get insecure when I'm arguing with smart people. I have buds who try do the same thing when I post an article written by someone about a race issue that makes them uncomfortable, and it is pretty annoying, so I'll try to cut the bullshit a bit and dig into this in a more natural manner.

Ok, I'm just gonna go paragraph by paragraph here and give sort of what I think. I didn't really want to respond, but you put a lot of work into this, I feel like it deserved a genuine response.

1) Thanks for being honest about your views on male sexuality, genuinely, I kind of feared I would be fed something palpable, this is raw but it's fantastic. I don't thank that men should be making virtual nudes of other women, I would be furious of that happened to me, even if it wasn't disseminated. I acknowledge the fact that women have been sexualized by men to a very harmful degree. However, I really don't think that men sexualizing women in their own minds. Masturbating to friend's social media posts is creepy, but sexualizing somebody in your mind is only ever harmful if it's a situation where it's a friend or it affects your conduct towards them. If sexualizing strangers in your mind is both harmful and something women don't do, then men really don't have a chance at appeasing feminists when it comes to how we discuss our sexuality. If finding someone sexy for a particular reason is harmful, then men's sexuality is inately harmful. This is what the discussion was meant to address. That and, more of a problem that men's issues groups have to address directly, women have made strides in normalizing the use of sex toys for women's pleasure, but men have not. (This kind of extends in a weird way to the sex toys themselves, I remember feeling proud to buy a dildo because I felt it symbolized taking control of my sexuality but feeling ashamed at buying any...uh...male pleasure toys because there's a stigma attached to those, they're the symbol of giving up on sex with women.) This is due to patriarchal and toxic views upheld by both women and men, but views that are primarily the fault of men. MRA's do try to blame this on feminists, it's bullshit. We have to do that ourselves, but this is the first point of contention: we cannot do that if before we discuss our sexuality we have to lead by saying ""oh also all of this is inately harmful to women"".

Also, don't think I don't know what goes on in those fanfictions and erotic stories women read. As I bisexual men I will confess without shame that I've read quite a few of them because they widely feature pseudo-bisexual men having sex with other men. Men who have sex with and are primarily attracted to other men but maintain their attraction to women because women also like sexualizing these men. Women aren't, for the most part, bosses who abuse their power or coworkers who make men uncomfortable because the patriarchy doesn't afford them this power. They don't really have the power to do it to an extent that's harmful to gay men (besides those annoying straight girls who hang out in gay bars hoping to be some kind of exception, idk, I hear about them all the time but I haven't encountered any in my time exploring the bar scene) but I'm suspicious of the idea that if they did, they wouldn't.

2) Men's groups. I feel like you misread what I said here or I messed up the wording, probably the latter, I apologize. I'm not suggesting that feminists talk a big game about men's sexuality and then don't do anything about it. I'm suggesting that feminists back in the day only supported men because they had to just to get anything for women passed or start groups that helped women (I read the page, I read the page the day I got here, don't think I noticed which links referred to issues from the 90's at the latest...), and that feminists only lead discussions about men's feelings, harm done to men, etc to the extent that they have to to make women safer (...and which links were more recent). And I do see feminists discounting men all the time. Maybe not trans men, maybe not femme men, maybe not specifically gay men, but certainly I've read the responses to my questions about men in general and black men in particular. I'm at a few intersections, I'm not going to be happy just because I have one partially covered because I'm also attracted to dudes. I noticed how quick feminists were to dismiss the issue of black men being falsely accused of rape because it had it's basis in racist patriarchal ideas, and ignoring the fact that modern movements like #metoo ignore and disregard this when they discuss rape accusations against black men. And I'll repeat, not Bill Cosby, who was depositioned in 2005 and said on the record that he drugged women. Not R. Kelly, who had multiple child pornography tapes siezed by the police and got off multiple times because the police used illegal procedures to sieze them, as they often do for black men without million dollar defense attorneys. Black men who do not have the power to resist rape accusations from white women.

And I'm going to say something contraversial that I hope you know in your heart of hearts is true, because you all have to do it here all the time: you can and sometimes have to ignore half of the population when discussing your gender's issues. I mentioned a university group where men got together and discussed their mental health issues that was denied funding because it did not show it had an explicitly feminist leaning. The feminists in charge of the student government funding organization said that the Women and Trans Collective covered men's issues, so this group didn't have to exist. I don't know about you, but I feel like a group where men discuss problems and solutions related to men's mental health issues deserves to exist whether or not it discusses how patriarchal ideas feed into this using feminist language. The hardest part of this is convincing you of the fact that men should not need to convince you that they're covering your issues when they cover theirs. You have your groups. Let them form theirs. Don't let MRA's, incels, etc form hateful groups against women, stand up to them, but while you're fighting them, spare the groups that simply want to discuss men's issues without taking a class in women's. 

I'm not saying r/menslib should be like that, it shouldn't, the Men's Liberation movement has a strong stance allied with feminism, but sometimes men need to discuss issues themselves, and discussions on r/menslib that are just for the boys are valid as well. **The goal of these discussions and groups *isn't* to bring about gender equality by propping both men and women up. It's to move men forward to where women have already brought themselves.** I don't know about you, but when I was suffering from crippling depression getting out of that headzone was my first priority, not my work, because I wasn't going to do anything if I couldn't get out of bed. We want to replicate the progress women have made advocating for themselves so that we can both focus on bringing about gender equality, you all are already way ahead of that. I don't support men complaining about why feminists discussing women's sexuality aren't discussing male sexuality, all I'm asking is that you all extend the same courtesy.

Edit: That said, never directly addressed it, but I don't wanna give OP the benefit of the doubt. I should, based on all of what I've said here, but I think he's talking about an MRA group. I came here for the title but like, come on, nobody here was born yesterday, ""men's rights group""? That's some MRA language, men already have all the rights, we just have issues, that's why I call them men's issues groups, and men need to be liberated from shitty gender roles, that's why they're called Men's Liberation groups.

Also, little bugbear that I have, a lot of feminist advice to men is just not useful because we live in the real world and patriarchal mentality has been absorbed into our brains. Feminists like talking about the patriarchal role of the pursuer and how men shouldn't approach women at bars, etc, but the vast majority of men just wouldn't be with women if they didn't approach them, and that's on women, how they were socialized because of the patriarchy. Nobody wants to start forcing women to go after men (besides like, Bumble, but y'know, I don't mess around with Bumble, once a bi-exclusionary zone, always a bi-exclusionary zone). Just don't try to bullshit folks, we know what's up. Honesty is always appreciated. I don't love honesty, anyone who says they do is lying, honesty sucks, but I always appreciate it. I feel like women are going to feel uncomfortable no matter how men approach them because some men are real threats to women, and men just have to get better at communicating with body language and speech that rejection is both appropriate and expected."
884,It’s amazing to me how many times you used gender stereotypes as fact to support your arguments..you’re not as progressive as you think you are.

886,"I was with you until you basically called me out.

>jerking off to friends social media pictures is in no way creepy,

I do it too and unless you tell them it's not creepy. it's natural to have fantasies about people you're attracted to.  I agree with all the rest, I'm all for fighting sexism and i agree that men's rights groups should stop blaming women and start finding more systematic reasons for their problems. I'm totally fine with feminism when it fights important issues, just don't get bogged down with non-issues like men's masturbation habits and peeing positions, this is when feminism becomes unpalatable even to the most progressive guy."
887,"I think I’m going to listen to the scientists who have been studying gender based politics and social interactions for generations, rather than some pseudoscientific hack, but I hope you have a good one :)"
888,okay
889,"Exactly this. I think there are criticisms that can be noted, ones that will make feminists a bit more worried in general, because this isn’t yet an established group with a solid footing, and our history with men’s groups attacking, deminishing, and villifying women— but that doesn’t mean that I don’t think they’re off on a good foot overall. Nothing will be perfect, and as you said, even feminism isn’t perfectly unified— but I think, unlike a place like menslib, we’ve had more time to suss out the kinks to bring us closer to intersectionality and true equality as a group, whereas menslib haven’t had the time to really work out who they are or where they stand yet. That said, at least they do have a group to model.

I can offer my opinions on it, and criticisms, but ultimately, I support a healthy group for men to empower each other, and I do think that menslib is at least trying in aspects that other men’s groups aren’t."
890,"Yes, someone who has been banned from this sub is trying to start a brigade. Report anything that’s reportable, and we’ll handle it."
891,"Most venting is not to be taken literal because that's just how the world seems to be the person who is venting. Opposing views are allowed on that sub just like they are here. We don't learn anything from being in an echo chamber. 

I think you misunderstood when I was talking about men being seen as problematic when sharing their experiences, I was talking about within feminism. You're right that universally men have more influence when it comes to most things. But then again no one really cares about feminist men sharing their experiences universally except for other feminists who are not dismissing their experiences because it doesn't echo mainstream feminist thought. And that amounts to very few people who are taking these men seriously. That's why there is a need for a place like men's lib where men can learn from other feminists through shared experiences. I think of it like when someone talks about being a victim of something the best response isn't to call them a liar but to bring them perspective and understanding.  When someone's personal experience leads them to believe women can and men can't do something who am I to tell them that their experience is wrong and they should shut up? 

Generally that's not the case but individually that very well could be. I think that's what we try to do here when a feminist says something a little outrageous we give them the benefit of the doubt."
892,">Saying “women can and we can’t” is a roundabout way of saying “we are oppressed, and they are privileged” without using those exact same words.

Pretending that women are never in a position of privilege seems really, really healthy."
893,"Thank you for your well written response, and kindness, I do appreciate it and I feel like you listened to me as well as making your points known.

That said, I will be the first to admit that feminism is not perfect. Yes, even if we are intersectional, and even if we care about men’s issues. It’s a tough balance, and something that I think a lot of feminists might have issues navigating. Because, while this is new for you, you have to understand that it not being new for us might bring wisdom, but it also brings trauma.

A guy saying something along the lines of “men are stifled in this way” is not really going to set off alarms, but I do think it’s important to say that if you’re adding in “and women are not stifled in this way”— you can’t expect feminists to sit back while a bunch of men talk about our experiences. I will retract my statement about always taking in women’s struggles when talking about male issues, and agree with you that sometimes it’s not necessary. You’re right in that aspect.

However, I will say that I disagree with ignoring women’s struggles when referencing them. We’re told, on a very often basis, how our life is, and it’s tiring. It’s one of the biggest things toxic male groups like to pull. They theorize that women are just going around looking for “chads” and conniving about how to best fuck men over. That’s as tiring for us as it would be for you for me to tell you “men just think about who they’re going to rape all day”. And while I know menslib is not doing anything so drastic, this is still something they’re doing.

While women have easier access to mental care, it’s not good care. Just as our healthcare overall is not good. We’re very often scoffed at, misdiagnosed... sweet Anita (twitch streamer) was failed to be diagnosed with Tourette’s until her 20s, years after fighting with professionals who insisted she was “attention seeking”.

Saying that men need better access to mental health providers, and need to be more encouraged to take the help, is *fantastic*. 

Saying that men get shitty healthcare, while women are loved and supported in what they have, is *not*. 

The difference here is one is speaking on the issues of men, as a male, from their prespective.

The other is speaking on an issue of men, and comparing it to women, as to deny the issues we may have in a similar area. That’s what’s not okay. It’s speaking for women, and assuming our experiences.

It is of my thought, however, that if you are going to allow men to speak freely enough to start creating a wall against women, even passively, that you cannot, in good authority, call yourself feminist-aligned. You do not dismantle the patriarchy by stepping on the heads of others, making false equivalencies, just to make things better for yourself.

Additionally, I happen to agree about the issues black men face. Tears, if *any* tears are going to matter, are white women’s, and this is something that, I agree, feminism needs to step up on. However, and I say this with the most delicate dissection possible, I am a white woman. At a very young age, I was molested and raped by my brother’s friend, Greg. I never reported. Greg happened to be black. I’m going to be honest, if this happened today, I would be reluctant to report a very valid claim like this, because... honestly, I’ve dated many other races— and if it ended badly, everyone blamed it on their race rather than them being a shitty person.

My abusive ex? Was from another country, and was Muslim, and I could never talk about the trauma inflicted because people around me would seriously try and comfort me with words of “well, you know how those Arabs are.”

As a feminist, with education in a lot of tender subjects like this, I’m disgusted by this. I wouldn’t have allowed them to talk shit about my SO’s race if I were with them, and my SO’s race still doesn’t matter after I am no longer with them. That makes this subject hard for me, because while I acknowledge that stigma, who am I choosing? The potentially valid rape victim, or the person who is potentially being a victim of racism?

Personally, I don’t think we need to denounce those potential victims, they should be heard just as much as anyone else. However, I do think we need to look more into the individual case, especially if it’s a sensitive matter. I think the hang up might be, for some feminists, feeling like they have to choose between believing a woman, and believing a person of colour, and aren’t really sure where they should be. To be fair, immediate stances are very often demanded.

I think it’s a more tougher thing to navigate, rather than a cut dry topic. And to be solid, I am not advocating for white women against black men. I care about both, truly, but I can see where the tugging might come from. Nevertheless, I still do think the issue needs to be talked about, at the very least, and I hope it becomes easier, truly.

As far as the gay fanfiction world, I have a friend who loves gay fanfiction. I don’t. Not because I don’t love gay men, or support them— but honestly? I like reading stories from women’s perspectives, simple as that. I did ask my friend, a devout feminist, why she likes male slash stories, and this is what she told me...

“I think too much with heterosexual pairings. One interaction that may happen between a man and a woman may be problematic depending on the underlying sexist tones or not, that gets more erased with two men. I mean, usually it’s not entirely, but it’s far less prominent. I don’t wanna see sexist shit when I read. Not only that, gay men tend to be more expressive with their feelings.”

When I asked why not two women, then...

“‘Because I’m attracted to men. I don’t mean genitals, I’ve read slash where one or both were trans as well, I don’t really care, I’m just attracted to men, so I read about men.”

 I’m not saying all women who like to read that stuff are doing it with such  intentions, but at least a small portion of them are and I think that’s important to note. And, to be fair, I read het pairings— I rarely, if ever, love something I read because there is so much misogyny laced through it. I end up having to settle for stuff that’s subtle enough to try and glance over, or I just go read femslash.

Anyway, I’ve rambled enough. Thank you for your time."
894,"Gender stereotypes are used to justify sexism all the time, which is why I used them as examples. It does no good to ignore their existence. “‘girls who like pink” are just as valid as girls who do not like pink, and ignoring that a lot of people try to practice misogyny by mocking women who do fit stereotypes is not progressive.

But sure, if you want to ignore what I said, you’re going to do it regardless."
895,"Again, the point is you can’t address men’s issues without acknowledging the oppression of women. Making claims like “women are believed in rape cases” in order to talk about the issue men face in rape cases is not something that should be happening, especially when it’s not true. Claiming “men’s sexuality is stifled while women’s is celebrated” is also example of that exact same premise.

It’s leading to the guise that women are just needless complainers and don’t have systemic oppression, merely to address men’s issues.

Feminism is going to focus on women *because* women are the oppressed gender when it comes to politics and social issues relating to gender (and, if it were men, it would focus on men, rather than women) that does not mean that men don’t suffer and shouldn’t bring up their issues, but you’re acting as though this all is equal in terms of power and suffering. It isn’t. Women don’t have the power men have, and to deny that men are oppressed is not to deny that men suffer. 

If you want an excuse to be misogynistic and ignore women’s expressions of issues, you can go literally anywhere else, up to and including the toxic men’s “movements”. If you want to work with feminists to address men’s issues, you can’t ignore the voices, politics, and experiences of one half of the equation just to focus solely on the privileged class. That’s not how equality works.

So I don’t know what to tell you at this point, but saying shit like “women have this so great” while ignoring women avidly saying that they do not just to portray yourself as the “true” oppressed group, is not in the name of education or gender equality. It’s in the name of the same misogynistic shit society and other toxic men’s groups do— to paint women as crybaby children while men are the “true” victims.

Do not use terms like “feminist ally” or “feminist theory” while actively opposing it, that’s virtue signaling to gain a foot up."
896,"No one cares how you pee.

Jerking off to your friends is disrepectful.

They did not take pictures for your fap-book.

Otherwise, as long as you’re not being hostile towards women, we don’t give a fuck about your masturbation habits, except, maybe stop telling women you don’t know about them. 

“i was with you until you called me out” is the war-cry most guys go to. You can’t only give a fuck about our feelings as long as they suit your needs. To quote the commercial: that’s not how any of this works.

You don’t get to pluck the things you like from the equality handbook and toss the rest because it isn’t about you and may make you question your own habits."
897,"I could get you to give me the top 3 hardships women go through here, and then I can give you the top 3 for men (with plenty to mention after).

Men by far suffer quite a bit more in the USA than women.

900,"1. Opposing views aren’t allowed in this sub in terms of feminist theory. This sub is not the same as menslib because it’s not even the same style. This sub is for people— whether they be other feminists, MRAs, what have you— to ask feminists questions. The only people responding, must be feminists who are advocating on feminist theory. I cannot call myself a feminist, and then a question comes up about internalized misogyny, and answer it like “women are crazy”— because that doesn’t come from a feminist viewpoint. (Bad example but I hope it gets the job done.) 

Non-feminists, as long as they’re respectful, may participate in nested comments, but that’s about it.

Sure, two feminists could have different (not opposing) views on how to approach something, or how something is seen, but ultimately, if both comments reflect a feminist perspective, they’re not opposing eachother. So no, we don’t really have “opposing views” here, unless nestled in the comments, and they’re not considered feminists.

2. Even while “venting”, feminists correct each other. I can’t come into a feminist space and say something highly problematic about an oppressed group, and get away with it. It just wouldn’t happen.

3. Men are only seen as problematic in the feminism space by sharing their experiences, when they’re looking to talk over others or derail a discussion. Other than that, there are heaps of men in feminist spaces that don’t even really have the longing for a place like menslib. Let it be clear, however, that I don’t think those men are “better” than the others. Some need a space to talk to other men, which is perfectly fine and valid, and most feminists will support it— as long as it doesn’t become a fuck fest of ignoring women entirely to try and preach a false narrative of gender inequality.

The issue with me misunderstanding you talking about men in feminist spaces as opposed in general, is because you said “while women aren’t.” I’m not welcome in men’s lib to talk about my issues, I’m not welcome in any other male group even more than that, I’m also not welcome in society. So, pardon me for being a bit forward— but where the fuck am I supposed to talk about my issues? Feminist spaces, where people will actually listen to what I have to say— men *and* women, and not denounce me for being a crazy, manipulative, over-reacting c*nt. Which, I think you already know is perfectly valid.

The issue here is men needing a space where they can talk about issues such as the specific gender roles they’re forced into, feelings other than anger, horniness, and being content— so on and so forth. And yes, I empathize with you on that. Feminists understand this. The only issue taken here, is when that same group wants to turn around and make un-true claims about women, or talk about “women’s experiences” when there are hardly any women even present. Incels talk about how sad they are all the time, how they feel that they need to fit into a masculine stereotype to get any form of validity and attention. Incels, believe it or not, are touching on issues men face, but they’re going about it in the wrong way, and blaming the wrong people. This is one example of how a group, not necessarily terrible at it’s base level, can go from “seemingly healthy” to “toxic” very quickly— by ignoring privilege, blaming the wrong people, and ignoring what women have to say on the other side of the gender spectrum. 

Same with MRAs. On the base level, talking about male rape victims is a good thing. Wanting to advocate for men is also a good thing, but the calculation of society is incorrect. Instead of asking “why are people not taking male rape victims seriously?” They’re claiming that women are “evil manipulators” who cry their way out of trouble, or pointing fingers claiming women have it great without taking our issues into account, rather than looking at how society views women overall. They genuinely believe that women who are raped just have this easy process of reporting and being believed that women flat out, *do not have*, despite us telling them that we don’t have such a process. 

You cannot fix all of society, without taking all of the factors in and listening to the issues women have, as well as the issues men have.

I’m not advocating here that menslib is terrible, but just like anything, it’s not free from criticism, and yes, I find it troubling when mods as well as users are engaging in the same victim-blaming techniques other more toxic groups do, just in smaller doses."
901,"No one said that women, individually, cannot be in a position of privilege.

I’m saying that women, in terms of societal structure and gendered politics, are not. Especially if they’re women of colour, or disabled, or in any other way don’t fit an appropriate “subservient cis female” narrative. And, even then, women are mocked and beaten and belittled.

Women can be bosses, in which that individual woman may be in power over her male subordinate, that does not, however, mean that she has systemic privilege."
902,"Wow, thank you for your honesty once again, I really don't have anything else to say, just thank you for your time, your words, and your stories. I really do hope that someday we'll all be able to create a world where nobody has to make the choices you had to, either between themself and another or a group and another. These are things I will keep in mind as I continue my own journey, I wish you luck on yours. Also on a lighter note, thanks for the bit on slash fiction because that always confused me, but I get the rationale now. A lot of the het stuff does have an uncomfortable level of misogyny that I notice I don't have to think about (as much) when I'm reading stuff written about gay men, especially by gay men (not to say they aren't misogynistic, but they tend to include much less explicitly misogynistic stuff in sexual stories involving two men. Funny phenomenon that you or your buds might have encountered yourself, heterosexual erotic fiction gets weirdly misogynistic when it's written by a gay man, and I truly don't have the psychology stuff needed to explain why)."
903,[deleted]
904,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not discarding your feelings and as I said I agree with pretty much everything you said, it's just that sometimes these little things add up and one ends up asking ""what is really feminism?"". As you said, you do agree with some ideas from MRA groups but you don't agree with these groups when they discard women's problems, well it goes both ways. Policing men's peeing positions like the Feminist Party did  in Sweden is not feminism, making moral judgements about men's natural attraction to their friends is not feminism (it's just your personal opinion), banning people from negotiating their salary is not feminism, all the man-hating SJWs you  see on Twitter and YouTube are not really feminists...yet they all call themselves feminists and all this keeps adding up.  it goes both ways, feminists and MRAs can both be toxic, I'm not discarding anyone's feelings more than you're doing, I just want to support the good part of feminism, the part that concerns serious issues that women actually face but sometimes it's hard to find it just like sometimes it's hard for you to find  the good part of MRA."
905,I don't think anyone is claiming men have no issues.
906,"Yeah I mean

The GC/FDS/PP types... are weird. GC are transphobes with a background of misandry, and PP/FDS are misandrists with a background of transphobia (though I'm not convinced FDS isn't a bunch of dudes masquerading as women). I don't know anything about TwoX. But as for the others, we certainly don't associate with them and we don't welcome them here. I don't know that it's fair to say ""women's groups usually become man-hating,"" though, just based on that.

The person I was responding to said ""my argument was pointless"" because ""women's groups also do that,"" but I'm not arguing that men's groups *shouldn't exist,* just that if they crop up there has to be a serious effort not to allow misogyny to be a major factor in their activism (or whatever they do).

I see you edited your comment, so I just want to note that this isn't an explicitly female space. Plenty of men and nonbinary people participate here, and are welcome."
907,"If it’s a post on this sub, report it to us via the “report” button. If it’s a DM, report to Reddit admin (we don’t see reports of DMs)."
908," I really respect your opinion and you make some very good points. You're right that men'slib isn't perfect by any means and they are still trying over there to strike a balance between helping men without being too presumptuous and overstepping their bounds. Sometimes it could be a tightrope act.  

I could see a lot of times were feminists would take issue with some of the things said there. But my criticisms tend to be on the other side, that there is too much emphasis on men taking responsibility for everything and being condemned for their own socialization. There is sort of a tone set where it is assumed that men are essentially flawed and we have to consciously fight against our nature to become better people and it gets a little tiresome in my opinion."
909,">I’m saying that women, in terms of societal structure and gendered politics, are not. 

Ever?

Really?

LOL."
910,"You’re welcome, and thank you as well! And yeah, honestly it confused me as well, so I figured I’d just ask.

But, again, I’m not deluded enough to think that’s the only reason out there that some women might like stories like that. I did forget the bit about sex toys— I do agree with you, men shouldn’t be stigmatized for using them. Women’s sex toys have a dark history. The first vibrator was used to “treat” women of “hysteria” by ~~sexually ass~~— “using this ‘medical device’ to tame them”... so I do think that society has made better strides in that department to kind of turn that form of oppression on it’s head, not that the women using them are any less stigmatized... 

I’m going in a circle. 

Anyway, men should use sex toys, and feel just as valid as if they didn’t. 

Again, thanks for this talk! It was good xx feel free to message if you ever wanna talk about something, my inbox is open."
911,"I apologize, I’ve just come to a stand-still about how many times I can say the same thing.

In gendered politics and social issues, women are the oppressed class. That does not mean men do not suffer, it just means that they are not oppressed. Feminism is going to focus on women *because* they are the oppressed class.

If men want to create their own space to address men’s issues, that’s valid and perfectly needed. However, if that same group is going to claim that they use feminist theory, or are allied with feminists, that means that they recognize the bias and privilege they have, and would not be ignoring the oppressed classes’ issues to address their own.

You can say “it’s shit that men aren’t encouraged to discuss their feelings”, without saying “men can’t cry and women can with no repercussions”— that’s entirely ignoring that women are often vilified as attention-seekers, crazy, manipulative, so on and so forth. It’s a round-about way of pointing fingers, something menslib accuses mras and MGTOW of doing."
912,"The serious issues women actually face, like the systemic issue of hyper-sexualization until women become just an object of fuckability, scored by our male peers? About how our worth is entirely tangent on how we look? The serious issues like when women are called liars in matters of rape because they were not conventionally attractive enough to rape? The issues like how guys try and paint feminism as “fat, d*ke, man-hating lesbians”— almost to say that if they don’t want to have sex with us, we cease to even matter as people?

The issue where bosses and superiors will often try and coax women below them to sleep with them for positions, and then, if they do, those women are then denounced as not being right for the job or role, because they “slept their way there”? How they’ll blame women for men putting them in those spots?

The issues like women refraining from putting certain pictures on the internet, lest be disrespected by her peers? And, if she does, be accused of being an attention whore, looking to be sexualized? I know women who also don’t use a microphone when it comes to gaming, because as soon as there’s a whiff of “woman” on the platform, they are bullied and harassed off of it. 

Life isn’t just about the political, and neither is activism. Why are we forgetting socialization? We’re trying to gain a woman’s worth, which is systemically low, and by throwing a tantrum when women point out that sexualizing your female peers is disrespectful, doesn’t change that narrative. What does it say? That women are still there for your fap-bank, that we exist for your sexuality. That’s what it says.

Instead of denouncing the summery of what people are claiming feminists are saying, how about actually listening to the feminists.

It’s like manspreading. Do feminists want to ban men from sitting with their legs spread? No. Do we actually care that they’re doing it? Not really. It was started as a narrative to show how men are open to dominate space, while women are taught to make themselves smaller. It’s a talking point. A thought experiment.

Instead of getting all hyped up over it, *listen* to what’s being said. Stop saying you’re going to pick and choose what to listen to, and just listen. It doesn’t mean you have to make a huge change. It doesn’t mean that you’re a bad person. It means that it’s duly noted how women are perceived in society— whether it’s conscious, or subconscious, and it’s best for everyone to at least be aware of it.

Society teaches sexism from the moment a person consents to giving birth, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with looking at why and how we started doing that, in addition to how it impacts society, whether small or large."

928,"I saw this on a twitter post, I’ll tell you the username."
929,"The end Father’s Day thing had an element of truth to it...   there are some people who believe, apparently in good faith, that it should end.  Not many though I hope..

930,It’s a good thing knowing that people on this sub are supporting equality between all genders.
931,"Please respect our top-level comment rule, which requires that all direct replies to posted questions must come from feminists and must reflect a feminist perspective. Comment removed; you will not be warned again."
932,"Yeah. They just look the rest of feminists look bad. It’s like that in most groups, the psychos are always the loudest."
933,"If it was a joke about people dying in general, I would of been fine with it."
934,"I'm with you. I'm so over this ""A woman/feminist said something bad or mean that I didn't like. Please explain this and then apologize!""

Like, no."
935,There was a thread on Gendercritical under the title “The coronavirus is killing far more men than women...” with plenty of celebratory comments. I can still find it via Google.
936,"Are you asking if this one tweet is representative of the hive mind of all the females?

I’d be interested if you told me what you thought the context of the tweet was. That’s probably something that could lead to a good discussion, but if you just want to show us a tweet and say “Feel bad about this,” I’m not sure what the point of that is."
937,"So you saw one tweet and now you're asking all of feminism to apologize for it? No, wishing death on people is not representative of feminists or feminism.

Should I be asking you to apologize for all the millenials calling it ""the boomer remover""…?"
938,"I mean, 4chan was literally out there on the internet publicly planning to start the #endfathersday hashtag to make feminists look bad."
939,Are these even feminists though?  This is Twitter and anonymous.  For all we know it could be another 4chan hoax.
940,"“And no, I will not be providing any evidence that even one person actually said it, no further questions”"
941,yeah those people pretty much hate men tho
942,"I should of rephrased the question, I meant to ask if this is a real feminist. Also sorry I couldn’t find the tweet, and I tried to find the Reddit post I found it on, but that seem to be taken down. The context of the tweets was saying that the bright side of COVID-19 is that more men are dying."
943,"1. I have had to say this a few times already, I am not asking for anyone to apologize.

2. What I meant to ask was if this person would be considered a feminist or someone who is being offensive."
944,"Sure, I know it was basically bullshit as a social media event.  However, there are people who genuinely hold the belief, that’s all I’m saying."
945,"Additionally: I don’t count non-feminist actions done by a small amount of people who call them feminists to actually be an issue within feminism. There’s a theory behind feminism, and how to interact with others, and this isn’t it.

People will always try to make feminists look bad, in order to try and debunk the basic principle, so I honestly don’t care about hoax that people claim they’ve seen “a few” do."
946,I dunno if it would be better or worse if it was like... a random Twitter account with 4 followers.
947,"Well I do believe they qualify as “some women”. I don’t think this is a particularly productive question, but since it’s here and people are doubting it I remembered that thread. I’ve seen a fair number of tweets expressing the same sentiment in jest or otherwise, but I don’t remember the usernames. It’s not too rare an occurence to find stuff like that if you occasionally peruse the femisphere in my experience."
948,Do you maybe see why we might be annoyed that you found a random Tweet by a random person who is so insignificant that you can't even find their single Tweet again and then came here asking us to feel bad about it?
949,"Why do you think the author of the tweet was happy more men are dying?

Do you think she liked seeing men die? Was she advocating for men to die? Was she relieved that she’s less likely to die? Was it a tweet talking about health care?"
950,And why are you only asking the feminists? Why aren't you worried about the millenials? Your concern troll baiting is boring.
951,"Well, yeah.  QAnon is a thing too.  I am not going to ask my local Republican Committee about them because the one has nothing to do with the other really."
952,"I completely agree. I feel on platforms like YouTube and 4chan (I don’t use 4chan, I’m just basing this off of other comments) are trying to make feminism look bad by showing the “feminists” who are trying to offend men instead of showing the majority of real feminists who are actually believing in equality."
953,Yeah I guess I just forget they exist sometimes since I pretty much discount them in all things due to the bonkers-ness.
954,"I’m not asking you to feel bad about it, I was asking if you would consider this a feminist"
955,"I won’t be able to recite it word by word, but it was along the lines of “At least let’s look at the bright side of COVID-19, more men are dying.” Then it showed a chart showing death rates by gender. It was a rather short tweet, but I thought it was unnecessary and rude."
956,"Well, that was an interesting google chain you just sent me down 😬😉"
957,"That’s always going to happen, tbh."
958,We get a lot of questions asking us to explain/defend/denounce/apologize for the actions of random people. It gets old.
959,I mourn your lost innocence.
960,Oh lordy that'll keep you busy for a couple hours at least.
961,But I’m not asking that.
962,"OK, so why are you asking the question you're asking? It just feels like a shit test for feminism."
963,"No, you’re allowed to watch and not-watch whatever you want. You don’t have to tolerate anything."
964,"I grew up with the UK Office. I thought it was one of the finest comedies (as a male teenager from London). I recently tried to rewatch it now it in my late-20s and ended up turning off after a few episodes. It was just no longer that funny to me.

Many of the jokes in the UK Office depend on cultural norms in an old world of work. Our office environments and expectations changed in a very public and highly charged way since the show was made. But the UK Office not only riffs on the old work environment but also on the way social change actually happened. It makes light of complaining about inappropriate behaviour. Watching the UK Office just reminds you of the lazy stupidity of people for whom the old environment worked. Complaining about inappropriate behaviour at work is taken more seriously.

In order to ‘enjoy’ the UK Office you have to channel a more naive and regressive age. That feels a bit cringeworthy. What used to be clever and treading a line now seems purile. Redrawing that socially acceptable line, so as to sympathise with David Brent is just a bit unenjoyable. 

I decided to turn off because the show now just felt a bit naff and had not aged well. I think the writing is good. The characters are well-developed. I recognise that, at the time of its release, the show was actually surfacing these issues and helping to raise a/ any conversation about inappropriate casual sexism, racism and bullying. As a viewer today though? Too much work to find it funny. We grew up...."
965,"I loathe the office.

I've had to work in toxic environments in my life - why would I ever want to bring one into my home for entertainment? 

None of the characters seem to have any redeeming qualities. And there's an awful lot of sexism and other bullshit going on.

I also hate that fans of the show replace bits of their personality with it. Like, I have personally watched maybe 4 episodes, but through people quoting it obsessively and memes I basically know the entire story."
966,no. sometimes shit is just cringey and not funny
967,"I can't speak to the UK Office but I tried to get into the US version last year and just couldn't do it for the same reason.  Michael just seemed so awful to his employees and so many of the jokes were nothing more than him being sexist, racist, homophobic, or some other flavor of bigot.  I kept waiting for a redemption moment that didn't come, at least not in the chunk of the first season I watched.  I stopped watching after the basketball episode, when his petty, insecure asshole traits were fully on display and totally unmitigated by anything approaching likability.

That being said, I totally get that this is a lot of people's comfort show, and we all have a tendency to overlook problematic jokes for the shows that give us the warm fuzzy feeling of being with our weird fictional friends.  I do the same for 30 Rock and Parks and Rec.  If I'd gotten into The Office back when it started airing in 2005 I'd probably be a lot more forgiving towards it."
968,No. There are a while bunch of movies I won’t watch for the same reason. I either leave the room or we choose something else.
969,Everyone has their limits and tastes. I start screaming at the screen if the thing I’m watching is preaching some sexist garbage.
970,"Nope.  Ricky Gervais (star/creator) is himself a terrible, terrible person and the show is freaking awful.  you don't have to find anything funny, you don't have to sit through something you don't enjoy and don't have to support something that is against what you believe. simple as that.  the joy of being an adult is getting to chose what you watch, tolerate, and enjoy."
971,"It depends. If you forced your partner to not watch it, then yes you went too far. But it’s fine for anyone to say it don’t like this, I’m not going to watch it, obviously."
972,"I really love the US version and tried to watch de UK one but is too uncomfortable and something feels wrong, that's my feeling. So speaking about the US ver. I loved every single character except for Michael, I coudn't stand him in any scene. He literally causes me anxiety, how he speaks to the secretary, his boss or the black coworkers... He is supposed to be a exageration of all those childish bosses but it would be nice to see him gettting some punishment... Anyway, I watched it bc of Pam, Jim and all of the others. It's okay if you can't tolerate that piece of shit, thanks to the new generations we can see that humor doesn't have to be sexist or racist to work."

976,"Thanks, I just have enough of those stupid sly remarks filled with bias. Not only towards me but everyone. It just infuriates me!"
977,Thank you!!!! I really love this feedback.
978,Yup! It absolutely sucks and is beyond inappropriate!!!!!!
979,"As long as you still let people make the jokes, like you’re not trying to take away that right, then I agree. Everyone has a different sense of humor."
980,Especially after Parks and Recreation did the same concept but like 100x better.
981,"Isn't the fact that Michael is a selfish, petty, racist, sexist, homophobic person the point? He's this awful person, and he's the boss everyone has to deal with. Obviously it's not everyone's cup of tea, and nobody has to watch what they don't want to watch, but it's not as though we're talking about outdated and inappropriate humor people forgive because of nostalgia. The characters, and the show as a whole, know Michael is awful."
982,"I have no problem with whoever watches it. I just hate the ""humour"" in it. It's basically an excuse to be a bigot."
983,I threw a pillow at the telly 😂
984,Thank you. I've been called over sensitive soooo many times that I've been second guessing myself at this point
985,"Ricky Gervais is like, the worst that's come out of British comedy. British comedy has a tendency to be edgier and more in your facd, and some folks find that fun, I enjoy some British comedy shows. A sad byproduct is people like Ricky who think that saying offensive things makes them inteligent."
986,He didn't really care either way tbh. It was just one of those things when you keep looking for something to watch on Netflix and get too tired to keep looking so you click on the first thing that you've heard is good XD

990,"So sorry that you had to deal with The Office UK. I tried to watch it, but like, when Ricky Gervais started liberally using the n-word I was just done. The racist and exist jokes were grating, and that was just it for me.

(For confused Office US fans, UK comes at you fast. I think the Michael Scott and Dwight equivalents start using the n-word around episode 3? I can usually deal with British humor, but this was a bit above the typical. The joke was also ""racism is bad,"" which was annoying. Like, making a joke as an excuse to say the n-word is one thing, I don't love that, but making a ""racism is bad"" joke as an excuse to say the n-word is just terrible)"
991,"I made the mistake of watching the pilot of M\*A\*S\*H, damn but that show is unwatchable. Much of mainstream culture has not aged well."
992,"I think it’s the best lens to view it if you were to have to watch it again (no one should *force* you to watch anything).

The lens of the time and place of its release and that it’s “undignified” humor was to highlight societal problems not just be *edgy*.

Personally I think a lot of shows that can now be viewed as “problematic” can often earn a pass (not always, and I think that varies show to show, person to person).  But I don’t think problematic shows from the past should be immediately axed from watching.  Friends is a good example.  Because we don’t ignore the issues that didn’t age well within the show (lack of diversity, gay/trans jokes, gender roles, etc) and there are plenty of YouTube content pointing them out I don’t think it’s an issue for people to start the show for the first time in 2020.  People should get to see the the difference of how a popular show generally thought to be “progressive” during its original run can easily age into the problematic category.

Of course some things just won’t be everyones type of humor and there’s only so much that someone can view without the problems overwhelming the viewing pleasure.  The N word, hard R’s, uttered by white people are generally a hard stop for me.  I only watched one episode of the U.K. The Office and knew it wasn’t for me.  Friends though? I can got back to it because even if there are parts that make me cringe overall what makes me laugh and enjoy it are the timeless bits about love and friendship."
993,"Uh... are you seriously wondering if we want to use government power to ban the Office from TV?

(We don't.)"
994,Making “jokes” is not a “right.”
995,"He’s supposed to the the awful boss with a heart of gold, or at least a character you love to hate. I never got any of that, he was just consistently cruel and insufferable."
996,"Yeah, but Michael Scott is meant to be a sympathetic character. The show constantly redeems him for all the shitty stuff he does.

Don't get me wrong, I like The Office (British moreso than USA), but I also like the older shows with outdated and inappropriate humor. My impression is that the younger ""woke"" crowd loves The Office, yet shits all over the older shows for being sexist/racist/problematic, and I've never really understood why The Office seems to get a free pass for all the problematic stuff Michael does.

&#x200B;

edit to add: I disagree that the show and the characters know Michael is awful. They think he's flawed and naive but is a good person underneath. I personally like the show because I generally agree with that sentiment, but I can totally understand and don't blame anyone for not agreeing with it and not liking the show."
997,"Fair enough, your fine then, your weren’t unreasonable"
998,"No free expression here, I see. This is to remain an echo chamber. 

I never understand why people wouldn’t want their beliefs challenged, like do you really think that’s to your benefit? 

Best regards,

999,Sorry.  I’ll leave you to your echo chamber. I’m a lesbian woman but clearly my opinion doesn’t fit your template.  I love how you are so tolerant of anything not immediately sycophantic to your cause
1000,The Office UK is horrid! The amount of shit that is said during the first episode nearly made my head explode!
1001,"g, I literally said I’m fine with it. I know the government isn’t trying to censor that, hence why I didn’t say “the government is trying to censor that.”"
1002,It’s freedom of speech.
1003,I do think you're definitely right about that when it comes to the first season. He's especially awful and hard to watch then.
1004,"I think the most problematic character on The Office is actually Jim. He's a bully, he's a snob about other people's interests, and he's a the epitome of the ""nice guy"" trope. But the show presents him as the protagonist without any of the (admittedly half-assed) comeuppance Michael gets."

1010,"I was confused, because you said ""like you’re not trying to take away that right"" as if you weren't sure whether that was the case.."
1011,"That just means the government can’t arrest you. It has nothing to do with how people react to you in public or private, or how we manage our user base here on Reddit."
1012,"freedom of speech just means the government can't come after you, it doesn't protect you from people telling you that your 'jokes' are offensive or that they don't like a show."
1013,"I don't totally disagree with you. I've only seen sporadic episodes of the US version, but Jim strikes me as smug as unlikeable. His only redeeming quality is that he's not Michael or Dwight. If you take that away, he's basically just a self-assured asshole who constantly makes other people the butt of his jokes. 

Part of the reason I like the UK version better is because I like Tim a lot more than Jim. Tim gets bullied at times, and is a lot more sympathetic and likeable. Also I watched and loved the UK version before the US version even existed, so I'm biased."
1014,"If I had a dollar for every time I asked someone to abide by the top-level rule and they exploded in ""oh, so this is just an echo chamber? where you don't believe in freedom of speech and want to censor everyone who doesn't agree perfectly with you? you just can't deal with opposing opinions! fascism! fascism I say!"" I'd be out of debt by now."
1015,"Name calling, very nice. 

So anyone who doesn’t share your point of view is a dipshit? Sounds like something an open minded individual would say lol.

I understand that you’re allowed to, just not why you’d chose to. It’s the why that’s making no sense to me. I wasn’t even particularly rude or mean in my comments either."
1016,"Yeah exactly. I’m agreeing with you I don’t know what the issue is. You shouldn’t ever tell someone to stop making jokes because you don’t like them, but you also shouldn’t feel obligated to listen to them. You can block who you want."
1017,"No, people who visit subs and get pissy that they're not something entirely different are dipshits. Do you also not understand why, for instance, askhistorians has rules about top-level comments? Different subs seek to serve different functions, and rules help ensure that they do so."

1034,yes
1035,"When you interact with a person, listen and be considerate. Obviously you can joke around, just don't do it at the expense of others. Don't make anyone else feel less than human. Basically what you want to do is recognise that a woman, or non-binary, or whatever, is a fully functional human being living their life... Recognise them, in that life, as being authentically trying to find peace in who they are. They are no more ""other"" in their identity than you are in yours. 

Beyond recognition, if you seek to help... then you need to offer your service and that act will often result in someone telling you what is needed. Here go to your local community and offer your service, start locally and work from there."
1036,"Obviously it varies person to person and situationally, as all humor does. But what I have found (and I am a woman) is that you need to develop trust with women you know and demonstrate your character and you can really take it pretty far. I'm 40 and work in healthcare, so I've worked with A LOT of women in my career. We are just as raunchy amd juvenile as men are, I promise you. So if a dude you like, who has demonstrated that he respects your intelligence and you as a person makes an off hand remark it's awesome! However, if a guy you don't know does it, it comes off as creepy or presumptive, like they're overstepping. 

I have a boss who is a former marine and about as cis gendered of a male as I've ever met. He's also a certified drug and alcohol counselor and has done his work on his issues and prejudices and such, so he's a fundamentally decent man. His wife also works for our agency in another department. He's in an office with 4 women and I'm the newest hire, I've been there a year. He would test out the odd risky joke here and there at first to see how I reacted. I don't offend easily so would try to meet him or beat him with a comeback. So we mutually encouraged this and the limits to how far you can go grew. We're wildly inappropriate in my office. It's great because everyone is on board. 

That said, if a nerve gets touched, the speaker apologizes and it's dropped, no justification needed. If he says a joke that is sexist (for effect because he so obviously does not believe it), he will get the laugh and then immediately say I don't think all.women [whatever it was] and genuinely looks for reactions. But really, there haven't been any hurt feelings because of it in the entire time I've worked there. 

I highly recommend Brooklyn 99 as an amazing example of feminist and inclusive humor. The B99 sub actually has a lot of discussion about that, if you are interested. 

Obviously this is just my opinion and one example from my life, but throughout my life I've had many male friends joke with me and it's about developing trust and taking cues and correcting if you cross a line. I hope this helps."
1037,">How much can I joke around?

Without even getting into gender, I have always found that some people ""joke around"" at other people's expenses 

Humor is subjective, but if your version of ""joking around"" includes putting someone (or a group) down, whether they're in the room or not, isn't helpful"
1038,"So this is a little silly because it sort of presumes that feminists don't like men around, don't want them to have fun or be at ease, etc. So leaving aside that part of your question, here's a list of DON'Ts:

* To me this is one of the biggest ones-- don't be a ""White Knight."" Functionally, this means you should not assume you are a better feminist because you are a man. In practice, this might look like: re-stating a woman's feminist arguments so as to improve on them, on the assumption that you can do so more clearly and objectively; defending a woman in an argument while cutting off her own defense of herself; assuming feminism is in dire need of a man's input; or explaining to women how to ""do feminism"" or suggesting ""improvements"" to the movement (which usually come off as a man telling women what to do to ensure he is happy and comfortable).

* Second biggest: don't co-opt feminist language to tell women what to do. This means: Don't try to get a woman to send you nudes or engage in sex acts with you by talking about liberation and sex and body positivity; don't tell women how they should look or behave on the grounds that it's ""not feminist"" to do X, or it would be ""more feminist"" to do Y (e.g., makeup, short skirts, body hair); do not use slurs like *bitch* or *slut* and claim you're using them for ""empowerment"" or to ""reclaim"" them; they are not yours to reclaim

* Don't think that draping the mantle of feminism over your shoulders will shield you from accusations of misogyny, or will protect you from people interpreting your words or actions as sexist. Do not gaslight women who call you out on your own bad behavior in feminist spaces, or tell them they are overreacting, being emotional or irrational, or claim you are only acting within the highest standards of ""reason and logic"" in order to brush off criticisms. Do not play Devil's advocate. Do not treat feminist issues as thought experiments for your own detached amusement.

* Do not assume that feminist women will still perform emotional labor for you because you are a feminist too; do not enter a feminist space and dump all of your emotions out and behave as though your ""being vulnerable"" is a feminist act while you sit back and wait for female feminists to help you sort through all your problems. Do not treat women in feminist spaces as sounding boards off of which to bounce all your personal struggles with your masculinity.

* Do not treat feminism as a pin on a jacket. It is not a way for you to feel good about yourself and to safely remove yourself from difficult discussions about patriarchal societies and sexism."
1039,"Joking is fine, but dont do things like joke about men dying or being killed, etc

Dont talk down to/condescendingly to people, thats gonna put people off you real quick. Dont make other people feel like they're lesser

Dont tell women what to do or act like you know more than them about the issues they face

Dont do things like act like all other men are horrible and make a point over distancing yourself or do any kind of self-flagelating shit."
1040,"I am a male feminist myself

\> Can I still be fairly sarcastic?  How much can I joke around?

Mate, joke around as much as you want (as long as it is not some of that 'women are stupid' shite, then you'll be good. If your gonnae be a feminist, any sexist comments need to be dropped). Maybe it is just the environment I grew up in, but I just always felt comfortable doing banter with my mates (most of them are feminists anyway). The worst thing to do in my opinion is to treat your feminist friends as some other group. Just treat them like with anyone else!

Welcome to the movement by the way!

Edit: I saw one of the other comments mention that you should not marginalize other groups. That is very important too."
1041,"Have you ever seen this?

https://youtu.be/EUGDDbuLvvU

It's a really easy watch.

The main thing I reccomend for fellow feminist allies is to be open to criticism of your attitudes and behavior. Just dont get defensive when someone says you're being sexist. Try to understand why and see if you can change."
1042,"I know this is probably entirely unintentional, but your question implies that feminism is about this careful PC line you have to walk down, and if you put a toe out of line, you'll get crucified. In reality, \*\*you are very unlikely to put a toe out of line if your actions come from a place of respect\*\*, and if you are generally respectful, the reasonable people will be OK with an occasional faux pas.

Let's take Aziz Ansari, fake male feminist. He says all the feminist phrases and seems to publicly support women's rights, but the way he treated that girl (see the scandal he was involved in) was disrespectful and demeaning. There are conservative men who say they don't like feminism, but treat women with more respect than Aziz did, and ultimately actions are more valuable than words.

When you respect someone, you are careful to not do anything that makes them uncomfortable, and consider how your actions are making them feel. For example, let's say this woman was Aziz's boss, do you think he would have continued pressuring her for sex even when she seemed reluctant? Haha no, at the first sign of reluctance he would have been tripping all over his cowardly ass apologizing and trying to make her feel comfortable. He would have been polite and faked interest in what she talked about during dinner, instead of making it obvious he was all about hitting it and quitting it. 

To me, feminism is asking that women be treated with the same respect that men are treated with. All you have to do is treat people like they matter, try to see things from their perspective, and eventually you'll get it right."

 I'm so so so glad that you were able to put this into words!

The message really stuck with me because it's something I had been feeling for a long time but couldn't really find the worlds to explain.

I think maybe you think I'm asking you not to open up to your friends or ask them for help, which isn't the case. The issue is that men too often assume their female friends-- feminist or not-- will be more than willing to help them sort through their emotional bullshit, without asking if it's OK or offering any sort of reciprocity. You should avoid that whether you are a feminist or not.

As for the input/defense: basically, if a woman is holding her own in a feminist argument, you don't need to jump in to be like ""Hey, don't talk to her like that"" or ""What I think Kaylee is saying is..."" Unless she asks you to jump in, maybe just let her go-- I hate Twitter for this, like if I'm talking to someone about something and someone else jumps in to have their own related argument. Then these two dudes are arguing with each other and I'm like ""okay, guess I'll just go make a cup of tea then.""

Generally just avoid gendered or racist insults? There's plenty of pejoratives for people that don't invoke gender at all."
1060,"""Being well-meaning"" is not the same as ""treating people with respect"". It is very easy to be a jerk on accident, it takes effort to be kind and understanding.

So when i casually bounce in to a conversation and challenge or question things I don't understand or agree with, I'm surprised the amount of emotion and defensiveness I'm met with.

1069,"I mean, Archer is a funny show and they portray female characters as being their own representations of assholery and fucked-up-ness without being victimized or made the butt of everyone else's jokes for their displays of autonomy. Even Carol gets to display her freaky affinity for being choked in the light of being absolutely demented and disturbing, without it being turned into a show corner stone of sexuality.

Archer is enjoyable for its equal representation of fuck-ups."
1070,"Asking for The Feminist Perspective on [subjective topic] isn't that useful most of the time. Feminists aren't a hive mind. We don't all like and dislike the same things for the same reasons.

Personally I really enjoy Archer. Other people here may not.

Question: Do you think feminists only consume media that they feel is perfectly feminist?"
1071,"I really enjoy it. I haven't really watched Archer while thinking about it through a feminist lense, but I think the show is really funny and entertaining."
1072,"Just to clarify the the Carol point, it due to the fact that they both let all the female characters display their sexuality so Carol isn't singled out and let her have more character than that with her addiction to glue, general insanity and delusions of granduer?"
1073,"No but I assume you guys seek it and would probably be more likely to enjoy something like Michiko and Hatchin over say Katekyo Hitman Reborn.

Really my question I guess is more related towards their use of their characters"
1074,"Yea, it's not like other shows where one female character is singled out as ""the hot one"" that is so fetishized by the creators that other show characters lust for that one particular character only. None of the characters in Archer are painted in a light as being a sexual object with no depth or level of personal depravity, even in the episodes Pam was given a massive weight loss she was still shown as being a very flawed person. It makes the show more interesting to have all the characters be multiple things simultaneously. And Archer himself is shown not to be an exceptional person above the other characters, but is just as dumb, and self-destructive while being a unique show character. It's just good writing."
1075,"Well, this isn't a hugely broad question or anything."
1076,"This is a very broad question but I’ll *attempt* to bite. 

Sex as a whole can be very harmful depending on the context, just as it can be beneficial depending on the context. 

Sexuality is too broad of a term for me to give my views on.

All sex workers deserve respect and the right to work, but I do acknowledge that many sex workers do not wish to have this as their occupation and often are forced either by someone else or their own circumstances. That being said, I do feel it should be decriminalized for sex workers sake. Sex workers that are underage, or are being trafficked deserve whatever support they need to get out of that situation. The concept of a pimp is morally wrong.  
All in all sex work is a very loaded and nuanced topic within the feminist community. 

Masturbation can also be harmful or harmless depending on context. Porn has had some not so great effects on society, considering a lot of it is violent or degrading towards women and many women in porn are being hurt or didn’t consent to what is happening to them. Revenge porn or porn that is made without the consent of the person(s) in it is morally wrong. But there is also porn made by consenting adults. It really just depends."
1077,"Sex is natural. Sexuality is on a spectrum and should be respected. Sex work is a legitimate and respectable business. Masturbation is normal. I'm not saying everything involving sex is all wine and grapes, but I believe the less taboo sex becomes the easier it will be to address issues involving it, such as abuse and exploitation within the sex work industry, sex addiction, and rape, so I'm sex positive."
1078,"\> sex

As long as it is consensual on both ends, no problem whatsoever. I shouldn't get a say in what happens between consensual adults in the bedroom

\> sexuality

You can fancy whoever the fuck you want

\> sex workers

Although I do not *encourage* it per se, I do recognize that because of the society we live in, it seems to be a legitimate way of trying to deliver for yourself and your family, and it should be legalized. In a lot of places where prostitution is legal, they have police to ensure the safety of these women, and I think that is a brilliant strategy.

How much should sex play a role in life?

If someone wants to sleep with as many people as possible, is that okay?  Not in like a womanizer, maninizer way but more, I just actively have casual sex whenever possible?

Sex Workers, how can I improve their lives?  Is using their services okay?  Would they exists in a non capitalist society?

Masterbation in general?  I know its okay but I guess is there a feminist perspective on it?  I guess that curtails into porn, which do I take a capitalist approach on it and support female sex workers (is a director also a sex worker?)"

I'd suggest searching the sub re: the porn and SWs questions since we've discussed them frequently."
1083,Thanks.
1084,"Wow. This is a whole can of— something, but I’ll briefly go over my thoughts on it. 

First off, no, I don’t think it’s ethical. Any of it. To liken it to violent video games? Violent video games can be problematic depending on who they’re being violent to— but mostly aren’t targeting real, actual people. Of course, there’s some philosophy that can be spoken to at length about the possible apathy towards violence created, but that’s a different subject and ultimately we’re not talking about the same issues here.

Just because “a lot of” guys do it, doesn’t make it ethical or “okay”. A lot of guys also think that getting a girl drunk to increase their chances to sleep with them isn’t a form of rape, but it is. A lot of guys also think that one woman sleeping with many men will change the structure of her vagina, but yet that’s still not true either. So, with all due respect, your argument that “people do it, therefore it’s okay” isn’t a great argument at it’s root.

Additionally, slut shaming is when women decide for themselves to sleep with someone, a few someone’s, or how they choose to dress or express their sexuality— and get stigmatized over it. Slut shaming is not someone purposefully violating an individual by doctoring pictures or videos of them with their clothing off, and the backlash that person who doctored the picture gets. Do you understand the difference here? One person is deciding what to do, and what to share, and with whom— about their own body. Another is making that decision FOR someone.

Women already don’t have control over their own bodies. You truly expect feminists to sit here and swallow that you should be given the right to take their photographs and do what you want with them in order to bust a nut? How is that anything other than creepy, disrespectful, and downright sexist? “Men wouldn’t care” — no, no they would. They would if their entire worth was put into how they look, and if they were sexualized since childhood. Even then, some still might. 

Bottom line, absolutely not. There is no ethical standpoint to any of this. If a woman decides to take her clothes off, and take a picture, and share it— that’s her consenting for her body, face, and image to be used in that light. She may do that for *herself*, you absolutely shouldn’t be doing it *for her*."
1085,"Suddenly only women think consent matters? That's pretty insultimg to guys like me who believes consent is extremely important and who hangs out with people who also value consent.

This isn't some thing only women believe because their tiny woman brains don't understand men or supposed ""male urges"" Men are capable of understanding consent and adhering to it, when they are properly educated. It sounds to me like you could use some of that education...it's seriously creeping me out how you are treating consent like some curiosity or thought experiment, instead of the moral imperative it is."
1086,I mean you kinda answered your own first question there champ
1087,"It is immoral and wrong to use other people’s social media images for masturbation. Tbh I find it disgusting and disturbing.

Those images were not posted for people to masturbate to, they’re memories of special moments or something people wanted to share with their friends. If the person misusing them was supposed to use that person in their fantasies they’d probably be trusted enough to get nudes. Or other pictures meant explicitly for the purpose of fuelling a fantasy.

So... they know they’re not supposed to do that. They know the person in question doesn’t want them to be their fantasy and they know it’s not acceptable.

But they still don’t respect that person enough to just leave it, go the extra mile and use their own brain for their own gratification. Like they should."
1088,"Hey also, what about fictional characters i.e. your Wonder Woman's, Storms ect?"
1089,"Question, what about look alikes?  Let's say you find a sex worker who looks like a friend of yours or some well known celebrity you have a crush on?  How does that come into it?"
1090,"You made a valid argument against people who would share those deep nudes and pointed out that slut-shaming is not the problem here but appropiating of someone else's body is, it's wrong to  decide for women what they should do with their  own bodies.  I understand consent when it comes to sharing someone's else picutres without consent, this is why I said the first point is valid and I was only asking about the reasons why women suffer from it while most men wouldn't. Your average young college guy wouldn't suffer if his nudes were altered by swapping his body with jason's Momoa's one and then distributed, women would suffer instead, I only assume slut-shaming is to blame but this is why I'm asking. One question: if women's value is based on how they look, wouldn't having a female model's body increase a woman's value in society? This is why I assume that slut-shaming may be the main problem but you probably know better.

As for the second point I enunciated, Just like people are free to do whatever they want with their body, aren't people also free to fantasize whatever they want in the privacy of their rooms?   Do you think it is wrong to masturbate to social media pictures of your acquaintances? How is this different than fantasizing scenarios about people around you in their head? Do you think this is also wrong?   You did even associate this with drunk rape but I find these to be two very different situations."

1093,"That’s not a real person. The ethics of it can be debated, like the porn industry as a whole, or, violent video games— we can discuss the potential issues surrounding such an action, definitely...

However, fictional characters do not exist, therefore there is no direct victim.

That said, that doesn’t mean that it’s problem-free entirely. As previously stated, we can always talk about the ethics behind the sexualization of women, even fictional or consenting. 

Like I stated earlier today: *nuances* exist, no single subject exists in “all okay” or “none okay”."
1094,"If you’re purposefully trying to search for people who look like the person you’re sexualizing, that’s weird too. At that point, it just looks like trying to take any step you can to justify creepy behavior."
1095,"1. I didn’t associate this with drunk rape, I associated the claim that “because people do it, that makes it okay” with drunk rape. It’s a direct example used where a mass of people assume it to be okay to do, even though it’s not. I never compared it explicitly to fake nudes, but rather your logic to justify them.

2. You can say you’d be “flattered” all you’d like, however... a) This contributes to unrealistic body expectations, a huge issue we’ve had with porn forever. b) You’re still using a woman’s face, even if you’re using another person’s body. You’re still making that choice for them. The model, also, did not consent for you to use her image to violate other women.

3. A woman’s worth in society is based on looks, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good thing. It’s a thing women have been fighting for years to change. Women should be empowered to do what they want with their own bodies, absolutely, but that doesn’t mean that their entire worth as a human being should be focused on it. So I don’t know why you’d think it would be a good thing to continue this tradition. Women’s worth should be based on who they are as human beings, not how many people want to fuck them. Full stop.

4. Sure, you’re free to fantasize what you want, but not at the expense of others. When you’re advocating for the common practice of violating a woman’s image, and claiming that it’s not problematic to sexualize women as if they are your own personal fuck toys, that’s where you’re losing me. Yes, it is creepy. And, yes, it makes women uncomfortable, but that doesn’t seem to be bothering you guys? “oh well, got off.” Good for you, doesn’t make you a good person. Doesn’t make you ethical. And, doesn’t make you any less creepy.

I’ve been sexualized since I was a *very young* child. Shit like this makes me cover my image on social media with either heavy filters, cutting off half my face, or using a different picture altogether. That said, if I found out any of my guy friends did this, I’d absolutely distance myself from them entirely and indefinitely. It’s one thing to have a fantasy, it’s another thing entirely actively jacking off to your friends with either doctored pictures or photos they put up that we’re not meant to be sexualized. 

Ultimately, it just shows a lack of respect."

Yes. This! If I ever heard that one of my friends was masturbating to pictures of me (I don’t have any on social media anyways but still) - I’d be livid.

It’s not normal, it’s not welcome and it shows they don’t perceive me as a full human being but rather as a sex object to be used in their fantasies. It’s just not ok. 

They know that friends wouldn’t send them nudes or anything to help their fantasy along - that’s why they use images from social media. Otherwise they could just ask for new pics. They know there’s no consent from that person for their pics to be used that way and they simply don’t care enough to go the extra mile and use their own brain. Or find some porn with consenting folks."

This seems like a impossibly high standard. I think the details of anyone's private thoughts (sexual or otherwise) would make people uncomfortable, especially if those people are the subjects of those thoughts.

This argument doesn't make sense in this context, we're not debating about the morality of piracy and, honestly, are your social media picture copyrighted? No, most people pictures aren't copyrighted and most social media do even have  a function to easily download public pictures.

**THIS**.

I actually once had a guy tell me he used pictures of me to get off, and I blocked him almost immediately. It boggles my mind that there are people out there that think this is totally normal and okay? Like, there are loads of awesome, beautiful women of all shapes and sizes who have consented to this, so why are they purposefully using images where it’s pretty obvious that consent isn’t given?"

1110,"What I am saying is that if you are going to ask if it is ‘okay’ to get off to generic social media pictures that someone posts when you have no reason to believe they are comfortable with that, I am not going to say that it is just peachy.  Now, I have zero interest in stopping it as that would require a huge privacy violation, but just in the abstract moral sense I don’t think it is so great to consciously fantasize about someone you have reason to believe would be upset by that.  It’s intentionally treating someone as a sex object just because you find them attractive, regardless of their feelings, and I think that is a lousy thing to do. 

I’m not talking about masturbating and idly someone’s face pops up in your mind, dreams or just getting excited seeing someone.  I’m talking more about stalking someone’s social media for something to get off to, and yeah, that seems kinda crappy and weird to do to someone who wouldn’t be okay with that.  Sure they will never know if you don’t tell them, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a not so great attitude there."

As for the other thing, sure, how would we know except you are posting here looking for us to say it’s okay.  No, I don’t think it is great to consciously fantasize about someone based on the vacation pics they posted online if you don’t know they are okay with that.  They are just existing online and you are treating them as an object for your sexual gratification, and that isn’t cool.

1113,"I already answered this, and you’re still searching for answers, but let me break it down for you as best I can so maybe something can stick.

Nuances are a thing. Life does not work in the binary. It does not work in the “this thing is okay in any light, subject, or way” and “this thing is not okay in any light, subject, or way.”

Why do you feel that it’s okay to use images that were not consented to be used as such? There are millions of pictures and videos of women who have consented to it, so why must you ignore that line, and act as if all pictures of women are just prime pickings for your jackoff folder? Go visit a cam girl. Go watch porn, or get a subscription to a premium Snapchat. Leave your female friends alone, it’s very clear at this point that you don’t respect them, and are in fact, just using them as porn filler.

Having a fantasy in your mind, alone, is entirely different than using pictures that were not meant for your jackoff folder to doctor or add to. This is where nuances come.

I don’t mean to be rude, truly, but I’m trying to press this issue. Guys really need to stop acting as if women exist to get them off. We do not."
1114,"No. I have never fantasised in that way about a casual acquaintance or even a close friend. I have never felt the need to use other non consenting people in my sexual fantasies.

Even if I had a crush on someone it was mostly the “I’d love to get to know them more” sort of idea. Sexual desires usually remained very unspecific until that person became active part of my life. And even then... 

I would be totally creeped out if men I know use me in their sexual fantasies regularly. Because I don’t want that and they know it. Otherwise I’d sleep with them. Or be intimate in other ways.

How hard can it be to not use other people for your own sexual gratification without their permission? Hell there’s even porn or tinder if you really need someone else. Or accounts on snapchat. Or gonewild on here. If it was really just about having someone or something there’d be options. This kind of stuff is a deliberate choice to take someone you know and use them."
1115,"I find your points inconsistent now. You first said that masturbating to your photos is wrong because it reduces you to a sexual toy for their fantasies since you didn't consent for it and now you're saying that it's okay for them to have sexual fantasies about you, but don't these fantasies still reduce you to a sexual toy? Wouldn't that also push you to cover yourself when you're around them, just like you do when you're filtering your social media pictures?"
1116,"I said it before and I’ll say it again: it’s disgusting to masturbate to your friends social media pictures. They don’t want that and you damn well know it.

Yes. I’d be creeped out if people were regularly using me in their sexual fantasies while knowing I want no part of that.

And where the line is: if you feel weird walking up to that very person and telling them „hey, I just did XY“ then you know it’s not something you should do.

Just use people who are consenting and all it good. But I’m guessing that’s too hard a concept to understand."
1117,"You keep repeating yourself, looking for a “gotcha, feminists!” I’m sorry, but I fear that if I continue this conversation I may start to become rude and condescending. Maybe another feminist here can continue with you, or you can re-read my words until you understand them— either way, I’m bowing out of this conversation and hope you have a good day. :)"
1118,"So to be clear, it's immoral to masturbate and think of someone you know who you aren't 100% sure wants a sexual relationship with you?"
1119,"Your public pictures on social media are not copyrighted, are you really arguing against this? Most social media even allow you to download public  pictures even in their user interface, I've never heard about lawsuits against this function. I don't want to sound rude, but this argument is ridiculous. Watching porn is much more likely to infrange copyright, piracy is rampant on every porn website but this still is completely off-topic.

Your second argument is reasonable and in-topic. I am asking whether this behaviour is moral or not, telling a random attractive person you'd like to have sex with them is rude because you infrange their personal boundary and not because your fantasy is inherently immoral.  I meet a lot of women everyday that I'd like to have sex with, just because I wouldn't tell them it doesn't mean that my ideas are disgusting as long as they're fantasies. Sexual fantasies make us human, otherwise we wouldn't reproduce and as long as people respect other people, in my case this transaltes into not telling random women that I'd like to have sex with them (really, is this you measure for morality?) I don't see where the problem is."
1120,"It was honestly a good 7 or 8 years ago, he’s been long gone. But thank you for your kind words! Xx"
1121,"This! There’s even subs on here for this kind of purpose. I mean... there’s a gonewild for everything. If you’d want a brownhaired someone with a specific body type in a very certain pose you could get that. 
But instead they take a person they know isn’t up for that and just go at it. I really don’t understand that mindset and it makes me mad."
1122,">No. I have never fantasised in that way about a casual acquaintance or even a close friend. I have never felt the need to use other non consenting people in my sexual fantasies

It appears that to be a good feminist one should comply to this then. I'm really curious  on whether male femist on r/menslib agree with this  or not since this goes against how male sexuality works in my opinion, I'll go ask them.  Trans people are an interesting example. You can just take a look at the FtM and MtF subreddits, reading what they write is shocking, HRT doesn't just make trans men more horny, it also changes them into people who can get horny just by seeing a portion of a woman such as a nice leg, it's anecdotal but makes sense since it is true in other male animals such as bulls or fawns which can get horny even just by seeing the head of a female of their own species even if it's decapitated and impaled.

**Thank for you answers, I appreciate that your line of thought is consistent. This is not a debate sub so even though I don't agree with you I now  know all the premises  that push feminists into thinking that this kind of behavior is wrong. It was very helpful, thank you.**"
1123,"I didn’t say it was okay, I said I wouldn’t find it creepy. I find it creepy when guys feel the need to prioritize their orgasms over my consent with my images, that’s what I find creepy. I never claimed that there wasn’t an issue with men thinking that women exist to be fuckable to them. In fact, I said the opposite."
1124,"Repeating that it's disgusting while ignoring my ""why?"" questions. doesn't help, do you understand? I  find your idea unreasonable but this alone is not an aargument and repeating it wouldn't help you, you should give reasons if you want to convince someone and debate.

>and where the line is: if you feel weird walking up to that very person and telling them „hey, I just did XY“ then you know it’s not something you should do.

Thank you, this is an argument. I meet a lot of women everyday that I'd like to have sex with, just because I wouldn't tell them it doesn't mean that my ideas are disgusting as long as they're fantasies. Sexual fantasies make us human, otherwise we wouldn't reproduce and as long as people respect other people, in my case this transaltes into not telling random women that I'd like to have sex with them (really, is this you measure for morality?) I don't see where's the problem is. I consider myself an unattractive guy, I've never had a woman interested in me, should I stop having crushes and fantasies about women around me just because no woman would consent to that if I were to act on them, even though I don't act on them? Is this what you're justifying?"
1125,"No problem, I can handle it but I can see why certain topics are triggering for others and probably everyone has one."
1126,"Not what I was saying.  I am sure people who are willingly putting out nudes aren’t interested in a sexual relationship with everyone who sees their pictures but are okay being fantasized about.  

And fine thinking someone is attractive and someone who looks like them is something you fantasize about.  

What isn’t fine to me is using an acquaintance’s social media of that’s clearly not intended for that and consistently and consciously doing that anyway.  Note I say consistently and consciously - we can’t always control what turns us on.  Something about the way this person looks in their pic from a fishing trip just gets you hot and bothered and you masturbate? Hey, that happens.  Downloading that pic so you can make it a nude or use it again and again?  That’s where it gets kinda weird.  Again, won’t know if someone does it unless they say so, but just in principle yeah I think that’s kinda weird.  

There are plenty of wonderful people putting out pictures that are intended to be used that way.  Why not look at their stuff rather than trying to find ways to get people you suspect don’t want to be in that kind of image in one?"

Still not jumping everyone in sight.

A friend is FtM trans, he’s taking testosterone and he, also isn’t doing weird stuff like that. 

Also: this is my sense of morality and the kind of feminist viewpoints I have found myself agreeing with. We’re not a hivemind. Other people may have other ideas, the guys at r/menslib may have different takes on it but seriously: your bioessentialist view is outdated and unscientific.

1130,"Thank you, I understand your point now. Thank you for answering my questions. Do you think that education can stop men from fantasizing about women around them? Or is it just biology? I just get aroused from seeing pictures of a woman my age, in my opinion this is also why dating apps work so well  for women but not for men, men are probably much more visual but I'd like to hear your opinion.

They're not ignoring them. They've been answered. You just weren't satisfied with it. That's your problem."

My thread

>Using this technology to privately satisfy personal fantasies is immoral and creepy.

Do you now see why I keep saying that  this  one argument from you is wrong and off-topic? You simply didn't read my thread and replie otherwise you'd understand that I was right since the beginning on this. **I've always said that it's wrong to share pictures but I don't agree that it's wrong to use them for personal fantasies.**"
1133,[deleted]
1134,Thank you. Slowly but surely this discussion feels like BS-whack a mole.
1135,"And my statement:

> If you are taking someone’s picture, which is their creative property, and photoshopping it to make a nude, chances are you are in violation of copyright law.  

These pictures you talk about in the original post do seem to get shared and in the sharing they are likely in violation."
1136,"I'm not doing shit all here, I'm just telling OP to stop being such a weirdo about whether or not other people approve of him cranking his hog to women he knows"
1137,"Which pictures are being shared? I made two clear points and scenarios, read my thread again. First point concerns picture that are being shared, I said it's wrong and it's right to be against it. Second point, I said that it may be ok to use pictures for private reasons. What did I say that is wrong? We seem to agree then."
1138,"""Cranking his hog"" lol."
1139,"I'm OP, why the ""3rd person""? You asked ""why do you care""."
1140,"I have known couples who made a new last name on marriage and their old family names became part of their middle name.  Then the kids get the new family name, and that seems like a cool option. Also they get to bond over what a total pain in the ass a name change is."
1141,just picking the cooler last name tbh.
1142,"I know this isn’t much help, but I don’t love the hyphenated system. Ex. Person A’s last name is Smith-Jones and eventually has Baby C with Brown-Cortez. Does Baby C’s surname become Smith-Jones-Brown-Cortez? Or do you run into the same problem of deciding which names to drop. 

We gave my son my husband’s last name, simply because I liked the flow of it with the first name I selected. The plan was always to give baby #2 my name when the time came. Now that I’m pregnant with twins, I’m leaning towards giving them both my husband’s last name. My son will always be the singleton and boy (assumption, who knows) to two twin girls. I don’t know. It’s interesting reading about what others do!"
1143,"The problem is that last names as we use them are patriarchal from head to toe. They are used to describe a men’s lineage. And it is to show who belongs to this men (children and women alike). I don’t think we can fix a patriarchal institution. I would abolish surnames for lineage relationship.


Extra Info: Genetically, human pedigree analysis is done by mitochondrial DNA, which is passed maternally. The mutation of blue eyes can be traced back to a specific female individual. All people with blue eyes are therefore related to one woman."
1144,"Icelandic uses ‘sson’ for sons, and ‘dottir’ for daughters. For example: my brother and I inherit out father’s (fake) name, that makes me Robinsdottir and my brother Robinsson. I think it would be easier if you just followed the European method: when you marry, you can choose to get the last name of your partner (sex of either doesn’t matter, man can get the surname of his partner) or to keep your own (most chose this). Children can get either last name or a combination of the two (in either order), but of course all children get the same last name. You can decide to change, though the procedure is a little hard in my country, but de facto you get to chose. Most children inherit their father‘s name, though I do know people with their mother’s or hyphenated."
1145,"I think the best thing would be just to get rid of gender for naming altogether and make all names unisex, you know, name your child what *you* want to name them rather than what society tells you"
1146,"Uh, I mean. Hyphenating seems fine."
1147,"Since we now have a largely literate population, written records, databases, recognized national registration systems, and authority control mechanisms for identity management, we could just not use names to communicate information about who your parents are. That way you could pick whatever you want. Maybe use sets of things so everyone gets  their own surname: each child a different colour, or tube station, or utensil. Or after your favourite authors or characters! That would be far more meaningful."
1148,"Me and my husband made up a new surname entirely. Me, him and our 2 kids are the only ones who share it.

We both have “maiden” names and it’s really lovely as it feels completely equal. We are a unit with our kids, and neither set of grandparents is more “family” than the other."
1149,"I feel like the most feminist thing straight couples can do is just take the woman’s last name. I also think the coolest or least common name should take precedence, unless it’s crazy hard to spell or pronounce."
1150,"Come up with a new name (based on the surnames of both parents if desired) for the child/ren. Parents could take this name on too, although I don't see this as being essential to the system.

Personally my son just has my surname."
1151,I like the one where daughters take their mother’s surname and sons take their father’s surname.
1152,How about the system where every mother decides how to name her own child based on her wishes and her situation at the time of their birth and no one else’s opinion matters?
1153,I've often thought about this. How do grandparents names work in this context? DOes the mother take her mother's last night where the father takes his father's last name?
1154,A family I know from the Democratic Republic of Congo has a system where the daughters take the mothers name and the sons take the fathers name - kinda cool!
1155,"If or when I have kids, I want them to take the last name of whoever has the easier last name to spell and pronounce. So if my partner has a 5 letter last name and mine is 2x longer and harder to pronounce, the kids will take my partner’s name. I intend to keep my last name and my partner keep there’s too."
1156,"I think that what you do is simply flip a coin when you decide which name to pass on to the kids. You can do a double-barrelled name, but it’s unworkable once the child marries another person with also a double-barrelled name, and also has associations of upper-class poshness in the UK. At the end of the day, I don’t think it’s an issue we should spend too much time on. Flip a coin: easy. I’m more concerned with the degree to which gendered first names are compatible with feminism."
1157,My fiancée and I are modifying my last name and both taking that. It's something we decided together to show the start of our new life together.
1158,"I grew up hating my last name. It's originally Swedish, but it was misspelled during turn of the century immigration, and now is *incredibly* unique. Unique to the point that I am one of two people in North America who has my first initial and last name... and I'm related to everyone who has my last name. In a world of internet searching, this makes me very uncomfortable.

So I was absolutely convinced that I would take my husband's last name. 

And then my dad passed away and now the idea of losing another piece of him is incredibly painful.

------

TL;DR I know nothing. Do whatever works for you. My sister took her husband's last name privately (on her passport etc), but keeps her maiden name professionally. I might do this."
1159,"My wife is from Spain and retained her names as is their custom. Not a single dam government agency can get her name correct. There’s always some variation on the first last name becoming a middle name, or joining the names together. It’s infuriating because of how they disregard the form you filled out. Both of the names are in the last name box, is it that hard to figure out?"
1160,The only thing that I would say is that we are assuming we know the child's gender but what if they are non-binary or trans?
1161,"I honestly would never give up my last name, but there's little probability that I could because I'm lesbian. If I merry I'll keep my name, which is hard in premonition and in spelling( Polish name) and my wife can either take mine or keep hers. If we decide to have children( which is unlikely but possible, although I won't be the one getting pregnant for sure, we can adopt) we will give them both of our names or mine( if my hypothetical wife decides to take it). I'm working very hard to make my name mean something and I want to reclame it from my abusive father by fully making it mine and I'm very attached to it. I could consider adding mg wife's name to mine but I'm not too prone to that idea"
1162,"husband and i tried to combine our last names into one cool new name, but both our names are too short and the only name that was pronounceable was ""smunt"", which is arguably a really stupid name."
1163,"I wanted to do this with my first husband since it was an short-passing issue with me keeping my last name of Holmes vs his last name of Cramer. I told him I’d be willing to do a mashup of Crahlms or something. Didn’t fly. I never had kids and we divorced after 15 years, so it ended up being a non-issue. I’ve graciously offered two fiancés and my current husband to take my name, but alas! They never seemed keen and often seemed a little more affronted when confronted with reverse logic. I assume it didn’t fly because it’s not about equality al all; it’s about patriarchal status quo, whether they realize it or not."
1164,"It would take a long time for something like that to become the norm though. 

I would change my surname to ""Alyosha"""
1165,"Or the one that's easier to spell. I kept my name when I got married but in the event that my husband and I had kids, they could have his name because it's 100x easier to spell and pronounce."
1166,"That’s what I did. My last name = ugly, hard to spell. Husband’s last name = nice, sounded good with my first name."
1167,"Traditionally, I believe you use the first “last name”, so that baby would be Smith-Brown. And since the man’s name traditionally comes first, that’s the one that usually gets passed on, so if you have two last names, they probably both came from your grandfathers. 

I actually quite like the idea of hyphenating names, in theory, since it lets both parents keep their names and lets the child have a name that represents both parents. I feel like there are ways to tweak it to be more gender balanced. Like if you made a decision when your child was born whether to pass on your mother or your father’s name or if there was some kind of 50-50 split on whether the man or woman’s name came first."
1168,"I mean, those people are also all related to one man - the woman's father. You're right that we often trace through the female line, but it's not like that makes one sex's lineage more ""real.""

I agree with your overall point, though - the system is inherently patriarchal, and furthermore not as necessary as many people seem to think. My ancestors didn't even have last names until Europeans made them adopt the system."
1169,Why would pedigree analysis be done with mitochondrial DNA? Isn’t it different DNA and also a only a small portion of the rest of a person’s DNA?
1170,"What would you suggest for naming then? Two or more given names with no relation to family?

Also, would switching to a matrilineal system for surnames be problematic?"
1171,"Here in Germany, if the parents are unmarried/have kept their individual names the children automatically get the mother's name as far as I'm aware. I know a lot of people who grew up with single mums that never married and they all share their mum's names. E.g. my half sisters have a different last name than I do, because they have a different mum."
1172,"Iceland doesn’t have surnames. These names are descriptions to specify which person exactly is meant since there might be several who are named „Björk“. So, the Icelandic telephone book is ordered by first names. But usually, that descriptive name is the fathers one but can be the mother’s one, too"
1173,"Ungendered names have always been available, they are selected by people and parents who want them.  My ID Cyathea for example.    

If children are given ungendered names some will reject them and choose a gendered name.   In the longer term gender associations will emerge for at least some names."
1174,"Unless your like me, where my initials pre-marriage were KK and my husband's initials were also KK in which case hyphenating is not fine."
1175,The kids should have hyphenated surnames? Then their grandkids would be named John Smith-Anderson-Murray-Jameson-Wilson or something.
1176,"Yeah, there ain't no escaping the gubment"
1177,"I have a friend who took her husband's last name. I asked her why not keep hers and her answer was that it would be an empty gesture since it would just mean keeping her father's name over her mother's. 

Not sure how I feel about that argument but it's relevant to your suggestion so I thought I'd through it out there."
1178,How is that feminist?
1179,"My surname is kinda of weird, if my future wife's name was really simple I'd let the kids have her name. I'd still keep my name though."
1180,"That conceals and devalues the sibling relationship, creating social confusion. Not just at the critical period of school and university, they will be siblings long after the parents are dead."
1181,Shouldn't both parents have a say?
1182,No
1183,My last name is a weird Basque name that looks funny. If my wife's surname was Evans or something I would just let my kids take her name.
1184,The parents would decide.
1185,"“Hi, we’re the Smunts” doesn’t sound great 😂"
1186,"We didn’t legally do it, but since we both kept our surnames when we got married we call our family the “Turpez” family."
1187,"Is it something like ""Smith"" and ""Hunt""?"
1188,Who are these crazy people  who wouldn't jump at the chance  to take the name Holmes? Madness!
1189,"If no one wants to take the other's surname, why not hyphenate?"
1190,"Well, yeah, any of these changes would take some time.  The hyphenated names thing has been kicked around for decades but isn’t terribly common. 

And that is a cool name.  Dostoyevsky reference?"
1191,"We had a hard time and just decided to keep our own. Husband and I both have really ""ethnic"" names and were fairly attached to them. I also recommended possibly using my godfather's last name since it was from my husband's culture but I had a connection to it. By the end, we kept our own names to save the effort, he said if we have kids they can take mine."
1192,I'm gonna guess your last name is Polish?
1193,My husband had a hyphenated surname and literally never used the first half of it (his mums half). I don’t think he even knew how to spell it! I’m glad we made a new name entirely rather than tried to hyphen the hyphen!
1194,"The kid gets both names as their surname, like a royal house."
1195,"Daughters take their moms first last name and sons take their fathers. 

Boom."
1196,"Yes, but he can’t be traced genetically. She was the first with the mutation to pass it on"
1197,"Because you can only get mitochondrial DNA from your mother or the egg. The mitochondria in the sperm are in the tail which “breaks” off when it contacts the egg.

As for why it’s different, there’s lots of ways it’s different. Structurally, it’s circular instead of linear. It’s also made of less base pairs, but there’s more of them in the cell. It’s kinda neat actually."
1198,"Most names were ultimately given by location, job or character. We could do this again for everyone. You can choose what you want to be associated with."
1199,"I didn't know that! In my country, stepfamily doesn't need to share the last name of course. Thanks for the clarification"
1200,"I didn't know that, thank you for the clarification!"
1201,"I mean, yes, that can be true, but we need to evolve as a society to change societal norms where this becomes more and more frowned upon."
1202,"That seems more like a medium term effect imo. Although that may happen for a few generations, eventually if names lose their status as a primary societal signifier of gender, I don't see a large trend of people changing their names to more culturally gendered ones being sustained."
1203,Ouch.
1204,"Just to be clear, I'm not even remotely suggesting that anyone *has* to hyphenate."
1205,"Well, that's the same problem with the Hispanic tradition. The mom's surname survives for her child, but it's dropped after that. 

So in your example, Cortez is little Emilio's paternal grandfather's surname, and Sanchez is his maternal grandfather.  His grandmothers' surnames are gone. 

It's better than our system, but it's still paternalistic."
1206,I mean obviously you'd stop including surnames after a point.
1207,"Sigh, I keep seeing this argument and yet it's just. Not. A. Thing.

You would take one name from each side. Ideally, one name flows down the maternal side and one the paternal (kind of like how most people pass on a paternal name now...just with a maternal one added), but in reality people might prefer to choose the two that sound better together, the one from each side that that each person prefers or feels more connection to, etc."
1208,"Just to be clear, I'm not even remotely suggesting that anyone *has* to hyphenate."
1209,"Thousands of years of women being expected to give up their identities for a man, the least men can do is take their wife’s name."
1210,It's not.
1211,"Concealing and devaluing sibling relationships is one of the issues I have with the current system. I know at least two pairs of sisters who I had no idea were sisters until weeks or months after meeting them, because one or both of them had changed their names upon marriage. Not generally an issue with brothers.

I'm a woman who has always liked sharing a surname with her brother so I've never been a fan of the idea of daughters getting mothers' surnames and sons getting fathers'."
1212,"If that’s the situation the mother is in at the time, sure."
1213,"I also have a basque name.  I lucked out and got a pretty easy one, though. It's only seven letters and fairly easy to pronounce"
1214,Obviously when the baby is born yes but if they grow up and do not fit in the binary system what then?
1215,"I, for one, welcome our new Smurf overlords."
1216,Sherlock
1217,If my last name was Cramer I'd definitely take Holmes over *that* name.
1218,"That makes zero sense. If you don’t want to take someone’s surname why would you hyphenate? It’s the same as taking someone’s surname. If he wanted to hyphenate and add mine name to his, he certainly could, but he was unwilling, so why the hell should I? I was raised as me for 20 years, I don’t believe I suddenly become a morph of someone else on marriage."
1219,"Not sure who that is.

1223,"Sorry I don’t think I worded my question clearly enough. I meant why do they use mitochondrial DNA for pedigree analysis. Pedigree analysis typically is used for analyzing the inheritance of genetic traits/conditions, so why would mitochondrial DNA be used for that?"

You can already change your name. Beyond that, if you're going to abandon a descendant-based system, you've got to ensure that record-keeping is very well done. It's a fallback heuristic for inbreeding reasons, not just sexism.

1226,"That was tried quite a lot in the 1980s and 90s.  Many parents tried to  de-gender their child rearing.  Unisex names, toys, haircuts, clothes, furnishings, books, activities. Schools joined in to varying extents.   

It did not work out as expected.  Children turned out to produce markedly gendered behaviour and preferences regardless of their upbringing.   

Adults got into degendering too, expanding their world to include activities and roles formerly reserved for the other sex.   Things got so crazy that in the early 80's men  learned how to do housework, childcare, routine cooking etc.  This was the SNAG revolution.  As with children, the results were not quite as expected.  SNAGs were  eclipsed by lad (and the derivative ladette) culture with its ostentatious ""ironic"" sexism and oafishness.  Other young women shocked their mothers by developing lipstick feminism.    

Social engineering isn't impossible but the results are not very predictable."
1227,"In English speaking countries the choice of which part of hypenenated names to drop from the children's surname is flexible so is chosen for  aesthetics, practicality, social status, to honour or denigrate grandparents, and sometimes for unspeakable personal reasons which I suspect would apply even in Hispanic countries."

1229,"Thousands of years? In which culture?

The Normans introduced them to the UK in 1066, so it's not even 1000 years in Britain yet. And it took about 400 years for them to catch on. 

Definitely isn't 1000 years in America. Native Americans didn't use surnames until about the late 1800s. Colonists introduced them.

Admittedly that's just US and UK, though most of Europe follows the same pattern. Most people think Romans had surnames, thanks to common knowledge of Julius Ceaser, but it's more of a clan name, I think, though I couldn't tell you the difference. 

In China, surnames began (according to legend) nearly 5000 years ago... But they were passed on matrilineally. They've been patrilneal for about 3000 years, though, so if you're referring specifically to China you have a point. If you're referring to western nations, it hasn't been thousands of years."

1233,"My step daughter just had a daughter and for her middle names, picked one gender neutral name and one ‘masculine’ name.  Figured it would be kinda cool, and then if she does grow up to be a man or non-binary, at least they will know that from the start her parents were cool with that, even if they don’t go with either of the middle names.  

And the last name doesn’t indicate gender at all in their case. My understanding is that now in Iceland -bur is an acceptable last name siffix.  So you could go with Jonsbur instead of Jonsdottir or Jonsson."

1247,"First off, there are studies showing there is biparental inheritance of mitochondrial DNA unlike what was previously thought. https://www.pnas.org/content/115/51/13039

Second of all, why would it matter if one part of DNA is passed down maternally. That’s like saying the Y chromosome is passed down paternally. Yes it is, but what bearing does it have on this conversation.

Both mitochondrial DNA and DNA on the Y chromosome are a small part of DNA, and not what we would focus on to analyze traits passed down from generation to generation. You would only see traits pertaining to the mitochondria, which really isn’t that much in the grand scheme of things.

Listen in regards to the original conversation I for one know that I’m probably not going to take a different last name if I marry. But let’s not misrepresent science to support our argument."

1250,"......in your opinion.

For another feminist's opinion (mine): the most feminist option if one is into marriage and heterosexuality is to 1) keep your own name and dash your kids' names, 2) change it to one or the other partner based on factors like spelling, cultural meaning changes, etc, or 3) create a new name altogether. 

By assigning a gender norm to it at all, you're perpetuating the exact same issues you're supposedly trying to end. I don't want men regulated to only the kitchen, and not having credit lines when single, and being denied promotions despite being more qualified to ""rebalance"" things. I want my sons to be able to choose to do whatever they want, including to take their wive's name or be a SAHD. I want my daughters to have that choice as well.

It isn't ""feminism"" to literally oppress another group in the way women have been.  That isn't the old ""privilege can make equality feel like oppression"" thing - that phrase would apply if someone was offended by women having an option at all. To deny someone an option just based on gender to ""make up"" for history? That's just oppression. And that's unfeminist."
1251,"I think that's ultimately the decision for each partner to make.

1263,"Hijab can be completely eliminated, but are surnames the same? So how are those comparable? 

If hypothetically Iraq had a rule saying one spouse in a household should wear hijab, then yes, your question applies  and I'd want my hypotheical Muslim husband to wear it (even as a sign of protest and to indicate how ridiculous forcing women to wear one is), because thousands of women are going to be the default hijabi spouses in their houses, and I'd want our household to reverse that stereotype (and still live under the law if we couldn't get out). Don't get me wrong, I'd also be protesting for my husband's right to remove his hijab meanwhile. Because irrespective of gender I don't agree with the concept.  

Last names are slightly different because unlike hijab you need(?) one (in most cultures/countries). Need is too strong a word perhaps, but you get my point. 

Again, I'm not the person you replied to and I think hyphenation is good. But I do think balancing the scale in this context would imply some men doing this to counteract the millions of women who have done this. A true balance would have to be millions of men doing it but that would never happen. And that will not be ideal (even to my feminist sensibilities). That would just mean we have reversed and now expect men to do it unquestioningly. But we have a long long way before we get there and there's no danger of such a society manifesting anytime soon, I think."
1264,"I am not the person you replied to, but honestly I too think that if there is going to be one surname, the husband should take the wife's. There's no reason to specifically do that, but then women did that for many many generations (and counting) without a strong reason too. So the least one can do in a marital unit would be for the husband to take the wife's name as a statement. To balance the scales a tiny little bit in this incredibly sexist world. 

Hyphenation is good enough, don't get me wrong. Or keeping each of their names without changing (this is what most of my friends circle has done)."
1265,I feel like having a reference battle
1266,"Why not just do the last paragraph? If some guys want to take her name, that's fine I guess."
1267,"> balance the scales

How does it do this?"
1268,"This is a weird question that we get all the time. It's like people are expecting us to talk shit on them or something. What exactly is your goal and asking us question? And don't say something like ""oh I just was curious"" because no you're not. What are you expecting?"
1269,"I support women regardless. I don't really care so long as no one is hurting anyone. Or straight up denying science. 

The only think I refuse to tolerate is forcing others to believe/think/do the things you do."
1270,"I love talking to women who have different views than me! If they are willing. It is fascinating diving into how others approach life and why they think it works or not. I'm trying to figure out my own place in this crazy world why not see how other people approach it. Doesn't mean I agree with them, but i don't have all the answers so who is to judge."
1271,"You can be “traditional” and still be a feminist. 

I’m extremely feminine. I prefer feminine clothing, I love cooking and cleaning, I wear makeup and spend lots of money on my hair, nails and overall appearance, I’d prefer my husband to be sole breadwinner while I take care of our children and our home etc. I’m about as traditional as they come and yet I’m still a feminist-and no other feminist has ever treated me badly or questioned my way of living. Feminism is about having choice. I choose to live the way that I live, and all women should have a right to choose what their life looks like.

I support women who are sole breadwinners of their family, women who are CEO’s of companies, women that decide to not have children, etc. Just because I do not live the same lifestyle doesn’t mean we can’t believe the same ideology."
1272,"The point of feminism, at least in my view, is making sure women have the opportunity to choose how to live their lives, as long as they're not hurting others. If I only respected women who were like me, I would deny them the choice I'm claiming for myself, which means I wouldn't be a feminist."
1273,"Depends on what you mean by ""more traditional"". There is nothing wrong with being like  tinylilcaterpillar. Having feminine traits and hobbies is not a problem but the concept of ""real woman"" is. Housewives are not a problem and there are not necessairly the ones with the most problematic beliefs. I know women who are not housewife material, who wouldn't fit the most patriarchial society due to their goals and hobbies but who are like, ""it's great that we don't have to be housewives and fully dedicate ourselves to children and spouses but women who work or want to work in certain fields is extreme feminists to me"". And these beliefs are problematic. BTW, I am not even the most unfeminine woman myself, I wouldn't want to be a housewife or, say, a football player equally. So, women with similar interests and dreams may have rather different views on women's issues.

I can't respect a woman who is like ""proud to be mature and wise enough to realize and accept woman's true place in this world"", ""happy because I am not deny female nature"", ""career women are all unhappy and denial"", who believes that women, unlike men, are naturally not intellectually curious and that education is needed only by ugly women and only for materialistic reasons, that sane women are disgusted by pretty boys/men who cry/artistic or musical men etc. I mean I support her right to not be body-shamed, not to be insulted by misogynist slurs and not to be recieve rape threats but that's all. I will fight back, I always do it."
1274,"This should depend a great deal on the beliefs in question, and how the person behaves. I don't lecture people on ""how they are wrong"" as a general thing and in a work environment I try to stay focused on the task at hand. It is only when the beliefs are really objectionable, and they act on them, that will call them on it. And even then it is usually a matter of objecting to bad behavior."
1275,"Just a question. I wonder if we support all women and all beliefs. I just found this community, and I am looking for one where I can really feel comfortable."
1276,"I appreciate that insight. I try to understand where others are coming from, instead of judging and arguing."
1277,"I really appreciate you sharing your view. Thank you. This is what we women should be about. Supporting eachother no matter what we believe, as long as we aren't hurting others."
1278,I like how you think!
1279,"I agree. If someone is hurting someone else or being racist to another, then that is definitely not okay in my book, and I would stand up to it."
1280,"I support all women, but not all beliefs. You can fight for people's rights without having to agree with them on everything."
1281,"Speaking with my mod hat on, I see you've gone through and peppered the sub with top-level comments. Can you explain exactly what your beliefs are, and why you would feel perhaps like they wouldn't be welcomed here?"
1282,True. But would a woman with different views be respected the same?
1283,"Agreed, I will also be watching."
1284,"Well I believe that women should have the same rights as men. We should have the same pay for the same job. We should be considered equal. Of course, I don't personally agree with women having to ""obey"" a man, but in some cultures, that is part of their religion. Unfortunately, I can't change that belief, but I won't bash a woman for believing that.

I also believe that if a woman wants to cook and clean for her man/woman, then that is fine also. If she would rather be a stay at home wife/mother, that is fine. I personally, don't trust anyone else with my financial well-being. I want to be successful on my own and wouldn't mind supporting my s/o. But if I work full time and pay the bills, then I would like for him to help out around the house. I don't want to be taken advantage of, and I wouldn't do it to someone else."
1285,"I guess that depends on what you mean by respect. I afford people respect because they're human and they deserve it; but I don't really ""respect"" beliefs I think are regressive or hurtful."
1286,"Depends on the views. For example, I would have less respect for a woman who is racist."
1287,"People can have bad views and I can easily be comfortable not respecting those views. Ex - I don't respect people who think black people are sub-human, or that women only belong in the kitchen. Those are bad opinions, in my mind, and I will lose respect for people who hold them. It's not something for me to respect just because they're different from mine. Not all opinions are created equal."
1288,"And yet elsewhere you say that in order to attract women, men should have the following 

> 1 very large checking/savings account should do the trick.

We absolutely don’t approve of that type of attitude here.

Do you consider yourself a feminist? Because with that type of comment, we do not consider you to be one."
1289,I agree there. Hurtful beliefs are not okay. Regressive as in unequal pay and the hurting of women is never okay.
1290,Well that was obviously a joke. Are people not allowed to make jokes anymore?
1291,"It’s not “obviously a joke,” because we get people in here *all the fucking time* saying “why do women only value men for their money”? 

Imma tell you straight: our community is not for you."
1292,"Well I guess you have answered my question. People aren't allowed to make jokes. I will tell you i am more financially well off than my S/O and I pay more of our bills than he does. The house is in my name. I pay utilities. He just pays a part of the rent, because I want him to be able to get on his feet a little financially. 

I was completely making a joke on a post I thought was ridiculous. I mean, come on....""what one item would you get to impress a woman""? That post in itself is a joke."
1293,"You have evidently not spent enough time in online feminist spaces to understand the kind of things we get here. Poe’s Law applies. And the idea that you would make that comment thinking it was a joke is indicative of a lot. So if you intend to hang out here, you may not make top level replies. You are welcome to participate in nested comment discussion as long as the other sub rules are followed. Please read those rules."
1294,"Sorry. What is a top level reply? Also, I am not an avid Reddit user, so I definitely have not spent much time in any sort of subreddit. Except r/discgolf lol."
1295,"I think the framework of that statement is faulty. It assumes that society collectively views women in a way that allows for them to be cast as specific types of villains.  The statement is like saying, “why does society turn a blind eye to women abusers” when mostly it’s just that society is simply blind to them from the beginning.  

I think people who come across as hesitant to chastise women accused and even convicted of a number of crimes is because they’re in denial that a woman could do such a thing.  You’ll see how quick society is to call out a woman when she’s unattractive or unconventional in her womanhood.  

tl;dr: No I don’t agree because when a woman doesn’t meet society’s standards they’ll jump all over her real quick but some crimes people simply can’t believe a woman could have committed it so it’s more of a denial due to gender not protection because of it."
1296,"Maybe because I live in a community where people are waiting for women to make one flaw, no matter if it is a silly mistake or a terrible crime, I feel exact opposite of what you wrote."
1297,"Definitely not. It seems the opposite. As soon as a female makes a wrong move they're ""called out"" even if it's for a good cause.

I remember a post (and I'll link it I can find it/it's requested) about a protest not too long ago in support of womens' rights in one of the South American countries where the government turned off the power. This wasn't the first (or second) time this had happened so they took to the streets. They ended up painting on one of the Catholic cathedrals about the abuses the church has committed against women (and children, etc.).

And what did the post do? Did it celebrate the women finally taking their voices? Did it focus on the injustices committed against the women that led to such an extreme?

No. It called them ""pieces of s***"" for daring to go that far.

So, no. I think that all over the world women are ""called out"" on everything that they do. Whether that ""thing"" is a ""bad thing"" that needs called out or a ""good thing"" that's twisted to make it seem bad."
1298,"I would say it depends on the crime and the society.  In the society I live in, while mothers are less likely to kill their children than fathers, when a mother does kill a child it is extensively covered in the media and there is a lot of public outrage and condemnation.  

Now, I will see people who are more dismissive of women raping and sexually abusing men and boys — see Bill Maher’s comments on teachers who rape their male students.  Now, this isn’t a view feminists tend to share with the larger society where I live.  Again, see Henry Rollins’s response to Bill Maher being so dismissive."
1299,"What do you mean call out? When I read this it seems like youre saying society knows women are commiting crimes, like rape and murder, but not asking them to stop because they're women?"
1300,"Fuck even being a victim is hard as a woman nowadays. Im afraid to ever testify against someone in court, they do everything to drag your name through the mud.

I’d also have to cast that people usually don’t frame women in certain crimes. My dad raised me because my mom was abusive and people couldn’t believe it. If society decides she needed her kids because of what ‘mother’ means, they would’ve been doing an injustice.

Women are capable of any injustice and it’s up to a jury or judge to be equal in their judgement."
1301,I think it's changed a lot. The media seems to gave a field day with focusing on female perpetrators.
1302,"This might be true of some, but it certainly doesn't apply to women of colour or women from Indigenous communities. Then it seems fair play to dump on them and disproportionately imprison them."
1303,"Going to break from the mold here and point out that in the US, women are given shorter and less harsh sentencing for the same crimes. 

I use this fact not as a a typical RedPill response to the idea that women are oppressed, but rather to use it as an example of the innate contradictions in how we view women in the US. Women are often held to an artificial raised standard, and will often be ridiculed for failing to meet that illusive standard. Yet there is also the notion that women are weaker and more vurnerable than men and must be protected. It's a innately contradictory and an apt display of how fucked puritanical values are."
1304,"I've seen people refuse to believe that women commit crimes, and ESPECIALLY that men can ever be the victims of women - if and only if they are social conservatives that believe VERY strongly in traditional gender roles. People - not society at large. Though I could imagine society at large doing so if it was socially conservative enough.

Basically, they are willing to ignore any evidence that they might be wrong about the inborn nature of men in charge of women, up to and including male victims of female crimes or female crimes of a type they associate with masculine behavior (violence, dominance-seeking, etc.).

I have never, ever, seen the MRA-myth of political correctness making police as a group afraid to arrest women in reality. Only in the wildest fever dreams of drug-addled hallucination would such a thing happen.

1305,"I think it has a lot to do with the victim of the female abuser/criminal. If the victim is a man I think people are more likely to focus on shaming him for letting a ‘girl’ get one over on him whether that be theft, domestic abuse, sexual assault, etc. if the victim is another woman or a child though I think people will not hesitate to call the woman out for being crazy, viscous, jealous, a bitch, et."
1306,"Yesterday, I literally found a page on a social media platform that was created to talk about female “criminals” and mock, objectify, or make abusive remarks about them.

And I put criminals in quotations, because this ranges from a woman who was at fault for an accident or got a speeding ticket or parking ticket, all the way up to murder, abuse, or rape.

Again, women only, and half the shit they said was really just  “socially acceptable” forms of sexism or bigotry, if only because the women in question were criminals.

So no. No I do not agree with it."
1307,"It depends on a lot of things. I think I see where you're coming from, and while women are definitely vilified for certain crimes, even more so than men (for example, prostitutes are punished more harshly and ostracized much more than the johns using them, and women who mistreat or abandon their children are significantly punished and judged more harshly than men, who are often barely acknowledged as doing wrong except in cases of severe abuse), there are certain crimes where the opposite is true.

The reason behind this isn't because women get ""a free pass,"" but rather because of how men and women are assigned roles in society. Women are seen as weak, fragile, nurturing, and vulnerable. This is why they aren't often viewed the same in cases of assault (toward other adults) and sometimes murder. Women often receive lighter sentences than men would in violent crimes that don't involve children, but not always. Sometimes people are so shocked that a woman could be violent that they want her hung from the highest tree.

This transfers over to the much, much more common area where women are excused more than men, which is cases of sexual assault. Again, this is based on sexism and gender roles. We see men, even boys, as sexually aggressive and ""always in the mood."" They're going after that reward, so any female contact must be wanted. You see this in our media a lot, with little boys snuggling up to hot women in music videos or jokes in shows that involve a little boy and a grown woman in a sexual situation. It's disgusting, but most people don't bat an eye, because it's been normalized. 

On the flipside, women are supposed to be a prize to win, never interested in sex the way that men are, and certainly never the aggressor. This goes back to women as weak and fragile, coupled with the fact that women are to be chased and not seek out sex themselves. That also ties into the harsh sentences prostitutes and women who abandon or abuse their children receive. Those women are breaking the unspoken rules and expectations of their gender. Women aren't supposed to charge for something that society thinks should be free to men, and she's also lost her value by not being virginal. She's supposed to nurture and be a natural child-carer, so when she isn't, she's punished more harshly than men, who are seen as natural wanderers. When a man steps up, it's praised, not expected. That's where the difference lies.

I hope that helps if you were able to get through it all. It's a complicated system based on sexist stereotypes and expectations toward women and men alike."
1308,"No, it seems like people are becoming more desperate to find female abusers, rapists etc. to help the “gee it sure is a scary time to be a young man in this country!” narrative. It seems like there’s even more effort put into this than there is effort put into stopping/punishing men who act the same way. Men also tend to be given the benefit of the doubt by most of society in cases like these, it seems"
1309,When a female teacher becomes sexually involved with a pupil that is under age it seems as though publications take every opportunity not to use the word “rape”. This may be for easier distribution to other places that only confer the rape moniker on sexual penetration by the perpetrator but it reads as a glazing over of what really happened.

1311,"Casey Anthony, Jodi Arias, and Amanda Knox would probably disagree"
1312,"I don’t think hesitant is the right word, maybe “turning a blind eye”. I think it depends a lot on the culture really and on the type of crime. 

More “normal” crimes like theft or murder without legitimate defense tend to get the same attention independently if the perpetrators is a man or a woman, in some places if it’s a woman committing this crimes it even gets more attention, probably because it breaks  from what people think is a “woman’s normal nature”(to be motherly, kind, etc). 

Now sexual crimes were the woman is the accuser do tend a lot of times to be rug swept, specially if the victim is an adult man. This is largely due to society’s view that men “can’t control themselves” and are “always up to having sex”, so we end up getting those really sickening phrases were people praise the man for “getting it”. Feminism says that’s due to established gender roles that affect negatively both men and women, so it fights to deconstruct those in order to achieve equal treatment for both be it praising or condemning. 

Appearance plays a role in both sexes, people seem to trust and think that good-looking people can’t be criminals and are more quick to offer them a 2nd chance."
1313,"When it comes to murder no. When a woman is involved in a high profile case she seems to be especially vilified. Casey Anthony was the most hated woman in America in 2012 and Myra Hindley is definitely hated more than Ian Bradey, despite him doing most of the actual violence. The only exception I can think of is Aileen Wuornos who is some radical feminist circles is hailed as a hero. For the record everyone I mentioned is an awful person."
1314,I wouldn’t say hesitate but won’t because they can’t comprehend such an idea. A lot of people whether consciously or not have this idea of the female victim and the male hero/perpetrator. It’s so ingrained in people that people can’t conceive of the idea of a woman abusing a man for instance.

I was never her biggest fan but the poor woman was absolutely trashed by the British gutter press (surprise surprise), and took her own life before her case even got to court. All because she allegedly threw a lamp at her boyfriend. I’m not saying she was innocent of assault - I suppose we’ll ever know. Both her and her boyfriend denied it. But she was most definitely called out, then figuratively hung, drawn and quartered. Disgraceful behaviour from the press."
1320,No.
1321,No.
1322,Depends in the crime.
1323,They are often called out but the punishment for similar crimes by men and women is far less stringent for women. This is because of the patriarchy that sees men as stronger and evil and hence gives them harsher punishments
1324,That’s why all those congressman went to jail for insider training but Martha Stewart walked free.  Or was that the other way around?
1325,No.

1329,This.  Last year I counted 18 different shows where it was solely dedicated to crimes women committed.  That many shows when women commit only about 4% of the world's murders and only about 15% of violent crimes.
1330,"100%. Ever notice how there are all these docuseries about women murderers? Ever notice the huge media circus whenever a woman commits murder? But men murdering their wives, girlfriends, kids?  It’s not even news."
1331,As in condemn them or chastise them for doing it.
1332,Do you think it should be up to feminist to address and fix this? If not who else?
1333,Would you say there are a lot of media articles about female crimals compared to male? Or would you say it's more of a matter of disproportionate reporting?
1334,Is that true for all races? Because i know for a fact. Black men are more likely to receive a longer sentence for the same crime compared to black women. But i was only told that stat in an modern African history class like 3 years ago.

1363,"Disproportionate reporting for sure.  Especially if the female is attractive,  the media will focus on that and demonize her much more."
1364,"I think it’s an outcome of something that takes place all the time. We like to vilify women just as much, if not more, than we like to ignore the issues of men. 

Women are called vicious, terrible names for cheating on an SO, being sexually active at all, being too “dramatic” or “emotional”, not being caring enough, etc.

We literally invented the vibrator to cure “hysteria”, which was a criticism of a woman having any thoughts, feelings, or preforming actions that men didn’t like. Doctors would sexually assault and use electroshock on women all the time in the name of “pseudoscience” to correct women being human.

This isn’t any different. The only reason some women are “let off” in a sense, is usually due to sexism as well. It’s thought that women do not have the ability to be truly evil, and therefore cannot rape men, or murder people, or be physically abusive— because they’re women, and that doesn’t fit the status of “woman” for society.

But to say that women aren’t criticized, cherrypicked, and weren’t literally hung, stoned, and burned is a fairytale. Yes, in every aspect. Whether the treatment was “justified” for them doing a wrongful action, or whether it was a made-up or petty crime altogether, women are absolutely, 100% condemned in society reguardless.

That doesn’t mean that men cannot be harmed by women being looked at this way. Obviously they can, but that doesn’t mean that women are just walking around, doing whatever they want because society just loves women, which is what your question is attempting to imply."
1365,"I can't confidently say whether or not men get the death penalty less, as men get the death penalty more in general. (Again, the men are strong, women are weak and must be protected concept.) But I can tell you that's the number one reason women do get the death penalty. To be fair, men do commit a much higher rate of murder in general, but it's still skewed to assume men are more capable and strong, so they're punished accordingly. And when I say ""people,"" I'm kind of including society in general. There are always going to be people who go against the grain, but the majority still see women and men in these damaging ways."

So I’d say, going on my very limited knowledge, every woman I know who’s been accused has received a backlash, where as not every man accused of the same thing has."
1372,When it comes to domestic abuse and such then absolutely. But the rest of the time with theft etc then I think society has largely moved past the idea that women are more likely to be innocent.
1373,"Yeah, it has to be that serious to grab our attention when men kill. But we all know Jody Arias and Casey Anthony—body count of one, each."
1374,"Maybe a push for gender neutral standardized sentences.
It shouldn't be possible for a woman to stab someone and get nothing but probation while a man does 10-20+ years for the same thing.
It shouldn't be possible for women to be given sentences served on weekends if men aren't given the same opportunity.
It shouldn't be possible for mothers to escape custodial sentences by virtue of having a child if fathers can't. 

If a man and a woman violate the exact same law, the sentence should be the exact same, no matter what. Removing the decision of sentencing from judges will help eliminate bias in sentencing.

I would expect feminists to be fighting against this benevolent sexism in favor or women, instead of largely ignoring it because women benefit in this particular instance."

1381,"How do you know women aren't getting longer sentences for murder than men?  And what makes you think that way more men aren't  given small sentences for violent crimes just due to the massive disproportionate amount of crimes men commit than women?  Let me guess, you read an Internet study that showed women get lesser sentences for FEDERAL crimes of which the vast majority were of non violent offenses like embezzlement and immigration.  And a study that would account for about 1% of crimes that go through the justice system each year.  

A man can embezzle a million and a woman 100,000, he gets 5 years she gets 3 years.  Same crime.  But he stole way more than her, should they be sentenced the same?  So you want feminists to start fighting for equal sentencing, based on what, some study done for Federal crimes, especially the vast majority non violent and only accounts for about 8000 women a year that go through Federal courts.  While about 100,000 men go through Federal courts. Like I said, get real.  You should be way more concerned about the fact  men commit the vast majority of crimes."
1382,And I was just giving *one* example of the literal dozens I've seen.
1383,"I do, while I think the men in the comments should be called out, I think it is more important to call out the actual abuser."
1384,"He continues to have a thriving career, make a ton of money, have a shit load of fans supporting him. He might have had his feelings hurt by people calling him a naughty boy but his life remains pretty unchanged as a whole.

Regarding Amber Heard - that’s my point. She’s the only one I can think of with a vaguely similar situation to Caroline Flack, and it’s not particularly similar at all. You asked me whether other women get the same treatment as Flack and I’m saying “what other women?” 

I’m not saying female-on-male violence doesn’t happen. But, if you consider how much LESS it tends to happen (I can only think of one solid example), and how huge a backlash Caroline Flack got (immediately fired from her job - hounded until she killed herself), and compare that to the many many cases of male abusers and their comparatively small backlash, I’d say women get called out more harshly than men.

But look, I’m literally going on your average jo’s understanding of celebrity culture. I don’t know stats. I haven’t done a load of research. I’m saying from my layman’s perspective, women get called out worse."
1385,What a nice change of pace
1386,"Look at the macro level disparity. As a whole men get 60% longer sentences.

We ignore nuance in the case of the wage gap so why not treat the sentencing gap similarly?

I'd support equalizing sentences for everyone until the gap disappears. This shouldn't be difficult.

*"" You should be way more concerned about the fact men commit the vast majority of crimes. ""*

Just wow. The sentencing gap has nothing to do with representation or the amount of crimes committed. Replace ""men"" in your statement with ""minorities"" and you sound like a white nationalist. You're using the logic of bigots. Think about that for a sec.

""You should be way more concerned about the fact men commit the vast majority of crimes."" 
While it is true that men commite the majority of crime,  law and society does a lot to condem and stop them where if a crime is committed by a woman, generally they don't. Whether or not you think that. It is justified, it does a disservice to male and female victims of the female perpetrator to just sweep their experiences under the rug because it happened less often.

For example majority of men who Successfully commite suicide are men but you should not sweep aside helping women who successfully committe it just bacause they do it less. 
(I am aware women try more often by using less violent means, also the gun argument its not that valid as the more men die from it in virtually every country with strict gun control like the UK)"

1391,"> Also why do you believe that people are more likely to give men the benefit of the doubt over women

I don't know that I'd phrase it this way exactly, but when a man commits a crime either *against* a woman or *because* of a woman (e.g., that pilot who intentionally crashed a plane because his ex wouldn't come back), people are very eager to sympathize with him for being pushed too far by some cruel woman/the pressures of society/whatever.

I think it circles back to the core idea of women being the moral gatekeepers and ""closer to Earth""-- we're thought to be responsible for curbing/handling/avoiding/mitigating men's bad behavior and worst instincts."

No, I cannot, since they are things I've seen or heard. How can you prove a personal thing that others just don't notice? Maybe you just need to pay closer attention.

1409,"I mean feminism is a progressive movement, based on a historical and philosophical reckoning with and rejection of the belief and action on the idea that women are inferior on the basis of their femininity-- people certainly can and do 'believe in' or 'identify with' feminism; but because it's a movement and a practice it's not like a religious practice where you have faith in it-- feminism exists to address a social injustice that has a long historical, physical, factual record.

Even after feminism achieves it's goals-- for example, say feminists were to make all the policy wins we're working on now (fair wages, fair hiring, child care, parental leave, bodily and reproductive autonomy, to name a few big ones)-- I would still identify as a feminist and there would still be need for that identity because those legal and institutional policies and social circumstances that guaranteed women's freedoms could be taken away again; civil rights and freedom are shockingly fragile, and their need of support doesn't just disappear-- especially in the face of centuries of historic and philosophic work that systematically denied those rights."

Can you do that?"
1411,"I understand that feminism is in a way an ideology, but the question does sound a little weird. The answer may be easy for other ideological groups who could say “Well I wouldn’t be a democrat if the democrats didn’t support LGBTQA rights” or “I wouldn’t be a Christian if Christianity didn’t have this idea of redemption”. To me, feminism is just about one thing: women having the same rights as men. I don’t think there is any information that could make me believe anything different or disassociate myself from this belief. It’s not like information could come out tomorrow saying that women have the intelligence of a snail or anything that would justify unfair treatment between the sexes. If you’re specifically talking about a feminist movement like they had in the 60s, I’d maybe say a focus on the “feminazis” as some men like to call them (the women who want a matriarchy more than equality), but those people aren’t real feminist. This question is like asking “what would make you think that you deserve less than men?” And I honestly don’t have an answer."

1416,"Thank you for this thoughtful response.

>To me, feminism is just about one thing: women having the same rights as men.

What if there were research done to suggest that equal rights (the technical definition of which seems unclear, which is a separate discussion entirely) decreases reported levels of content/happiness/satisfaction among either/or men and women?

Edit - In the following, I use ""welfare"", ""content"", ""happiness"" interchangeably, all referencing the specific idea of self-reported happiness or life satisfaction. I do not use the word ""welfare"" to refer to such metrics as levels of pay or employment in high management roles.

This is interesting to me. Presumably, the underlying goal behind Feminism/ists is the improvement of the overall welfare and reported content of all people, with a focus on women. The hypothesis, then, is that there should be a high positive correlation between levels of ""equal rights"" and self-reported content (weighted for female responses).

Within the zeal for this goal of ""equality"" (further driven by general western ideals about money, freedom, power, etc. which don't all have clear positive correlations with reported happiness), I can't help but wonder if the basic question of ""Does this improve the levels of life content among women?"" gets left behind. Presumably, Feminism is a model for how society ought to function and it is supported because and only because it will improve the welfare of women. If it didn't, it ought to be discarded for another model.

In my experience (I went to school at a large, liberal university and currently work in fintech), some of which can be gleaned in at least one comment here, there seems to be an inclination to feel that Feminism equates to caring about the welfare of women, as opposed to simply believing Feminism is a good model, while separately caring about women. The instant that happens, though, anyone who isn't a Feminist is a misogynist, and that closes the door for any constructively critical discussion (In other words, Feminism becomes less a movement and more a religion. I think this tends to happen merely because it is a quick path to self-comforting virtue and is not a behavior exclusive to feminists.). This leads to a, IMO destructive, ""with us or against women"" attitude. It should be assumed that non- and anti-Feminists do care about the welfare of women (not to say that they all do). This is why I think it is important to have a healthy and respectful relationship between the two/three groups. It is also why I find it concerning that my initial question was met with a rather pious hostility from r/feminism. It is also why I think forums like this are important.

For me, while I think some very specific and well-defined forms of equality are clearly beneficial (Suffrage being one of them), I think there really needs to be some more questioning as to whether equality in other realms of life is beneficial, as well as some clarification/quantification of the goals of the movement.

To be more specific, my impression from grazing over the available research is that it is not necessarily a given premise that greater equality, in the form it has manifested via the Feminist movement since early 1900, is entirely good for the welfare of women. Neither is it a given premise that a traditional gender-roles model is entirely bad for women. Feminists seem inclined to impose today's societal values regarding gender unto the past, when there is really not enough research to assume that women were exceptionally discontent with their relationship to men. Naturally, this is a difficult subject to begin with, as there are many other far more influential factors on reported levels of happiness than gender relations.

What if research was done that suggests women in regions with unequal pay, without an outstanding societal bias about pay, self-reported as being content and unaffected by the difference? (I won't go on about a big list, but one can imagine the other forms of conflicting research that could challenge core Feminist tenets)

I understand I've gone a bit tangential here, but I felt you gave a thoughtful response and would be a good sounding board and unlikely to immediately dismiss me as regressive. I am no expert on these matters, which is why I appreciate that this sub exists. I am curious what your thoughts are on what I have written here. I wonder if I shouldn't have just made this a post itself."
1417,One can only escape when they master every intersection.
1418,"Even if we reach all our goals, I would still call myself a feminist.  To not do so would be kind of like saying because I live in a democracy, I can kind of just ignore the government.  No one thinks one should stop caring just because a democracy is in place — things like gerrymandering and voter suppression are still a deal.  Similarly, feminism isn’t ‘over’ just because we can vote and hold a job."
1419,"Is equality about happiness? I’d be happier if I was a thoughtless animal, but I’m a human being with intellect and feelings. Equality is a naturally given right in my eyes. It’s not something that is reliant on anything else. All humans are equal. Period. That’s the end for me. Fuck happiness. Maybe some women would be happier not having to work or learn finances or be able to participate in traditionally male activities, but most women at least deserve the OPPORTUNITY to do those things. Choice brings a lot of unhappiness for everyone, but it also can deepen the world to you and bring you a lot of unexpected moments of happiness. The elderly women in my family never had the happy experience of graduating (even high school), and they didn’t get the opportunity to have a lot of the happy moments that have made up my life. I’ve heard nearly every elderly woman I’ve talked to say “I wish I could’ve went to school” when I tell them I graduated from university.


If someone isn’t a feminist, aren’t you the definition of prejudice against women. You can’t believe that women should have less rights than men and not be a misogynist. The definition of a misogynist is someone prejudice against women and believing they deserve less than men is prejudice. I hope you understand that in essence there really is no middle ground, because you either believe the sexes are unequal or equal. There is no half-measures in equality. 

Also, I don’t know where you’ve gotten your research suggesting that women have become less happy with increased equality. If women were happy with what they had, the gender roles would remain intact because women wouldn’t have found for the right to vote, work full-time, and live life outside of the home. I think women find greater satisfaction being able to have the choices that feminism brings. Maybe the research you’ve seen has shown that women have become less happy over time (which varies by country and we’ve had a downward trend in the U.S in both genders) as they’ve gotten jobs, etc. I’m sure that’s true, because many people don’t like working and wish they could not. But I don’t know that many women or men who would prefer not being able to CHOOSE to have jobs and have to rely on their spouses or father for money, housing, and food. Not only is in unfair for men to take on these traditional gender roles as it adds stress to them to be the primary breadwinner and everything else, but it’s unreasonable for women to be forced into these old gender types. Why would anyone want to give up their freedoms? There is no research that say having freedom is bad for women, because having a choice is always better than no choice. If women are unhappy right now, they have the option to leave their situation and start fresh. They can change jobs or be stay at home moms if they wish. They can decide to never get married. The only thing research could ever show is how one small piece has made women worse off when in reality it’s looking at one negative instead of a whole (like with the work example). A woman now has the choice to work and have separate finances, so she isn’t stuck with an abusive husband. 

I have seen studies that show some men can experience “dissatisfaction” with women having equal rights. I saw a study the other day that men preferred their spouses to make less money than them, because they wanted to be the breadwinner. First, I’d like to say that it’s incredibly stupid. If your wife has the opportunity to make an extra 20k, every man should be glad to be able to afford all the nice things that extra 20k can bring to the table. In all honesty, I don’t care if men like that aren’t happy with feminism. The world is changing, and they need to get with the program.


Lastly, I don’t get how you equate feminism to a religion. Of course it’s a model fueled by people caring about both men and women. Men get quite a lot out of equality between the sexes as well. How do you believe in anything without caring about it? Feminism is a moral code, an economic theory, and a fundamental aspect of life. Feminism isn’t about making sure women are happy, it’s about making sure women are given their inalienable rights. I’m not surprised that non-feminists are met with anger. It’s kind of frustrating talking to someone who thinks you are less than them for no other reason besides your gender. How do you think anyone would feel when the words “I’m not a feminist” equates to “I think you deserve less rights and opportunities than me”.  There’s a bunch of smaller groups within the bigger feminist idea, sure, but I don’t see why we have to have a complete list of what we are aiming for other than complete outright equality in all areas of life and within the law.

Edit: Maybe you can talk more about it in the r/PurplePillDebate. I’m sure that’s the “critical discussion” you’re actually looking for.

You’re coming at this from a fake research perspective, and it’s getting irritating. Feminism can’t be swept away with one change unless it’s a world-shifting change life everyone suddenly being equal. There is no theory that says less rights meaning more happiness. It’d never happen, because it’s impossible. It’d be like saying “What if people felt happier as slaves?” It’s not a real question because no one would be happier. It’s the impossible question because it completely negates reality.


You’re completely overlooking the whole feminist idea of equality (which isn’t hard to grasp), and are trying to get us to tell you some loophole to not believing in equality. I believe black people deserve equal rights and opportunities because again, they are human beings. I don’t spend half my day wondering “hmmm but what if....”. There is no what if. Human Being = Equal Opportunity.
Done. 

If you’d like to find a guy feminist to talk to, I will gladly hand my phone over and let you speak to someone who may be able to discuss it from a male perspective.

Edit 2: You don’t have to do research to believe in feminism. You can discuss with women and consult research and history books on certain feminist issues like voting rights, employment discrimination, etc to learn more about the topic. All women have a story of where they’ve faced discrimination based on sex, and history has a lot of examples as to why we as a whole are better off with more gender equality.

To get more information on how inequality and gender stereotypes negatively affects men, you can check out the r/MensLib reading list."
1420,"If there were research that suggested women self-reported, relative to the U.S., low levels of life satisfaction and happiness in societies wherein, among genders, there was equal pay, equal employment distribution among all industries, equal levels of property ownership, and/or sexual liberty (however that would be measured), would that affect your personal association with Feminism? If so, how? If not, why?"
1421,">Fuck happiness.

Then we can agree to disagree. I am not willing to sacrifice self-reported welfare/happiness of women for anything else. I think that is the most important fundamental metric by which any effort to improve women's lives can be measured. If a choice makes women fell less content with their lives, that is not a choice I will support.

>If someone isn’t a feminist, aren’t you the definition of prejudice against women... I hope you understand that in essence there really is no middle ground, because you either believe the sexes are unequal or equal.

No, not really. I am not a Feminist. I am also not an anti-Feminist. I am not prejudice against women. I am not an activist, but were I given choice between A) Thing that leaves women better off, and B) Thing that leaves women worse off, I would choose A. Am I still prejudiced against women merely because I am not a Feminist? Is it not unfair to assume what's going on in someone else's head without asking them just because of some title they do or don't align with?

There is middle ground, though. There are many different realms of life in which equality can be assessed. Are the sexes legally equal? Are they biologically equal? Are they equal in their capacity to perform any and all forms of work? The differences in the answers to these questions have ramifications. Do I believe there should be an equitable relationship between the genders? Yes. Do I believe men and women should have equal rights? Well, that's a pretty nondescript question and I think we would have to talk more specifically about what you mean by ""rights"" before I can really answer that confidently. That does not mean I think women deserve less rights.

In my experience with the laity (Perhaps it is different among scholars. I don't know any scholars so that is beyond me.), there tends to be a gross simplification of this concept of equality (which is, from the start, better worded as parity or equity). The relationship between sexes and genders is complicated. While some concerns like suffrage are indeed quite simple, equal representation across workforce industries is not. Equal pay is not simple; there are so many other factors that need to be normalized for and it's difficult to really measure that problem and discern an effective, granular solution (though more broad solutions have indeed been implemented through recent history). Those are the easy ones. When you try to measure concerns that are more thematic/social (balance of power, employment opportunity, societal expectations, etc.), it can be very hard to measure and harder to devise a practical solution.

>Also, I don’t know where you’ve gotten your research suggesting that women have become less happy with increased equality.... You’re coming at this from a fake research perspective, and it’s getting irritating.

As I mentioned, the results are difficult to draw confident conclusions from due to the other correlations involved with self-reported welfare.

\- [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-009-0257-4#article-info](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-009-0257-4#article-info) (Women in liberal areas with a smaller pay gap reported lower life satisfaction than women in areas with higher pay gap and more traditional gender values. You need an account to see the whole article, but the main point was that point of view was likely a significant factor in the difference, where traditional women did not view themselves as disadvantaged or unsatisfied with their life.)

Again, I am not an expert. However, my point was that it is not entirely clear that traditional gender values are wholly worse for women or progressive values are wholly better for women. This should give warrant for a more considerate reassessment of the value of some of the tenets of Feminism and/or how they ought to be implemented.

>There is no theory that says less rights meaning more happiness. It’s not a real question because no one would be happier.

It is a real question and indeed one that has been debated for a great deal of history in many forms. The whole idea of a governed society rests on the premise that the strategic restriction of freedoms will result in a more beneficial society for citizens than a total anarchy.

The second article postulates that part of the relative decline in reported satisfaction among women is because of the pressure they feel due to the vast opportunity they have been thrust into on top of the already existing responsibilities of womanhood/family care.

Yes, freedoms, in a localized sense, generally correlate to higher levels of happiness. Perhaps, however, we need to be more considerate of how we restructure our society if we are going to, in a historical blink of an eye, totally restructure centuries of precedent in the societal roles of genders so that it does not end up harming women more than helping them.

>are trying to get us to tell you some loophole to not believing in equality.

No I am not. Please do not extrapolate things I did not say from what I said. I am being very careful to be clear so that users are not inclined to do that. What I am trying to communicate is the point that ""equality"", as you put it, is much more complicated than I often see it made out to be by non-scholar feminists. I am not saying equality (read: equity) is unattainable or not worth pursuing. It is worth pursuing. One of the points I was trying to make in my previous comment is that if we are really to be productive about identifying, measuring, and addressing that issue, there needs to be deeper analysis into what is meant by equality and to what extent it is harmful and helpful, more openness to outside ideas that contrast tenets of a Feminism model, and less of this ""Feminist or misogynist"" frame of mind.

However, if you are less concerned with metrics like the self-reported welfare of women, and more concerned with ""x for the sake of x"", then my argument is irrelevant and any further critical analysis of procedure or goals is unnecessary. Again, this discussion, is why subreddits like this one are important and valuable.

Ultimately, I wanted some insight into feminists and feminism through the lens of the OP's particular question. This particular comment thread has evolved more into an unstructured debate, which I welcome. I am content and grateful for the engagement and the time people have taken to respond."

I really regret trying to give a thoughtful answer to someone who just came to try to inform women about him opinions instead of listening to what we have to say on the subject. Really shows you as a person. I don’t know why you asked your question just to try to push any information give to you into your own demented views which are “Although I don’t believe you deserve equality because women are not genetically/physically or whatever else equal, I’m not a misogynist. Also I don’t believe that women are happier with choices and freedoms, because there are these studies that show that women who work more and still take on their typical gender assignment within the household are unhappy. Feminism seems wrong, and I’m an expert on this. Let me tell you more about why you’re wrong.” Please just join the RedPill guys already."
1426,"I agree it is not a concern. The question was theoretical and I am curious what you response would be.

I believe Finland is up there. Although I'm not aware of any study that isolates the weight gender equity has on it's happiness levels, I would assume it plays a significant role."
1427,"Personally, I am just curious as to the responses. I wanted to know more about the nature of Feminist's belief/identification as such, as well as Feminism itself through this particular lens.

Typically, this question, or some form of it, is used in scientific,  academic, and corporate board settings, among other groups, as a self-reflective and critical exercise to internally evaluate a group's plan or hypothesis. It is typically used to assess and/or hedge the risk of tunnel vision that tends to form when a group comes together and formulates a plan with low levels of dissent and no outside reviewers. It is considered a highly productive exercise to identify and avoid risks or hypothesis flaws that the group might otherwise not notice if they did not force themselves to confront them through a thought exercise like this.

To further explain by example, another form of this kind of thought experiment would be: ""It is one year from now. We executed the plan and the company has lost money/our tests all proved us incorrect/the plan failed. Please take ten minutes to write down what happened.""

Additionally, the exercise is usually done unplanned and with little framing, so as not to compromise the productive function of it as a method of confronting risks/flaws which a group may become blinded to in their conviction for a plan.

I didn't really have a purpose. I just think it's a compelling question that has taught me alot about process and goals in my experiences with it, so I thought it would be interesting to ask it here."

I initiated it by expressing some opinions I had separate from the OP, actively interested in a Feminist view on them. Perhaps it was my mistake to engage you specifically in a comment section as opposed to a more formal, public post.

Obviously we disagree, and that's fine. I appreciated your thorough responses and indeed listened to them and tried to give a fair response. Though I think your interpretation of my argument is unfair, I do apologize if I offended you. It was not my intention."

WOW. No I did not know. Thank you very much.

> Poor women have always worked outside their homes

Yes, but there was a point where it was not a reason for social protest and there was a point where it was. My question is regarding when did it become codified as a public issue (not even a social issue but something that is the responsibility of the state and  which should be addressed in law).

> Women weren't 'pushed out' of the domestic environment-- this phrasing suggests that women have been somehow dissuaded or disallowed from domesticity, and that just isn't true

I'm coming from a marxist reading of the process. By ""being pushed out"" I'm talking about the processes by which relations of exploitation of workers pivoted to also exploit women through production work and not just reproduction work. I will no longer say ""pushed out"" because the effect was the double work day, not an abandonment of the domestic and I see how my redaction implies this.

 > A good place to start is the history of early labor organizing-- work was very gender segregated at that time, but women were as eager to join unions as men-- often because they felt it would allow them to demand more just wages.

Look, I'm not coming through.

There is a very precise definition of what a public issue is and what a social issue is. If something is not publicly discussed, debated, and if there is no burden of responsibility on the state on the part of the people, there is no *public* issue. Social issue and public issue are two different things

There was a point were women being poor was not a public issue, not because poor women didn't exist but because it was a social issue (not public yet, no burden of responsibility on the state, no public debate, no legislation, no political agenda). You are deliberately interpreting my comments in a very bad light thinking I don't know what I'm talking about.

When you're poor you do not have the capacity to turn a social issue into a public issue. Poor women have existed, structurally, since before the feudal ages. However, the **public issue** of the gender wage gap has existed for probably less than 200 years. 

I'm talking about *when* does this reality become a *public issue* by becoming part of what is considered to be part of the things the state must address. It has nothing to do with whether the problem exists or not. Please do not try believe I'm saying women only recently became subjects of laboral exploitation because it is not what I'm saying"

1. No, I really wasn't, and there's absolutely no need for your tone in this response.
2. I actually think this is an interesting/worthwhile thing to look into and was trying to be supportive in calling attention to what looked like a blind-spot in your process.
3. The public issue definition is a good way to evaluate, thank you for clarifying. I would suggest though that you not make a determination of your own about when it happened (saying it's only been a public issue for less than 200 years seems rather arbitrary given that you're just beginning research), but rather, let the research question guide you-- depending on the country where you are investigating the data, I think you may find there were some kind of ""public"" (this may require formal definition too based on your scope) benefits for poor women-- specifically women who had children out of wedlock. \*Workhouses come to mind most readily-- but limiting your investigation just to governmental or state recognition may unnecessarily narrow your capacity to understand the history. This is because most social work prior to the modern age was carried out by faith institutions and philanthropic societies and not governments and just because something wasn't being financed by a government doesn't mean there wasn't public debate about any given social problem."

Even though men as a group are not oppressed in comparison to women, there’s absolutely a hierarchy of oppression within men as a class. Because the hegemonic standard of masculinity is highly predicated on sexual prowess, dominance over other men, and impossible physical excellence, having a small or micropenis moves a man farther from the hegemonic standard and its benefits. Would I ever say that, by virtue of having a micropenis, a man is as oppressed as a woman least oppressed by patriarchy? No. This doesn’t mean, though, that patriarchy isn’t why men with small penises are mocked acquaintances and friends, shamed by sexual partners, and internalizing a great deal of patriarchal self-hatred. 

TL;DR: maybe there’s a better word than oppression, but whatever penalty society inflicts on men with small penises cannot be uncoupled from patriarchy

Edit: also, not all forms of oppression harm all groups in the same way. Racism oppresses all people of color in our society, but the extent and means by which that oppression takes place depends on many things. Asian people and Jews aren’t denied home loans in the same way that Black and Hispanic people are, but we’ve historically seen how our society blames plagues on Asian people and Jews moreso than some other groups."
1473,Feminists certainly tell small dick jokes all the time.
1474,"It’s a pun on Pee Wee Herman

1475,> the penis size issue aside
1476,"Because it’s punching up. I have a small dick. I think small dick jokes are hilarious.  It’s in good fun.  Not everything is an attack.  As long as you’re not being bigoted or taking away people’s rights, who gives a shit?  stuff like this is the reason the right calls us snowflakes.

It’s like when people (read: people who are probably not obese nor have ever struggled with obesity in their entire life) thought Thor in Endgame was “fatshaming”. I’m obese. I thought it was hilarious that Thor was fat. His fatness was authentic and relatable.  Like he had an arc. It wasn’t a one shot gag.  I have a lot of other *legitimately diagnosed* mental illnesses than the mild depression/alchoholism Thor exhibited in Endgame but his arc honestly was inspiring to me.  He had gone from a literal god to a complete failure but by the end of the movie he realized he was “still worthy”.  Why do people want to take that away from me?  It’s like they care more about conforming to the latest everydayfeminism article than they do about actually helping people.

I guess what I’m trying to understand is what is the problem with self-deprecating, relatable humor that doesn’t hurt anyone?"
1477,"Okay, I can tell this is somewhat of a hobby horse of yours, but here are a bunch of feminists saying it's not cool to make those jokes, so maybe lay off."
1478,"Ok while you're here I really gotta know, what kind of dog related booby trap are you planning?"
1479,"But it clearly *does* hurt people. Just because you aren't hurt by it doesn't mean other people have to swallow their feelings about it.

Making fun of people for stuff like that is just a shitty thing to do."
1480,I wonder if you finding small dick jokes and fat Thor hilarious is a subconscious coping mechanism your brain deploys to deal with the actual shame/pain you feel from society deeming those characteristics to be laughable.
1481,"Hot damn, this is like their... entire comment history."

1488,"Well we’re all victims to patriarchy to some extend and we should acknowledge that and I’m saying this as a straight white cis man. But as long as we dismantle it we are definitely not helpless. Feminism is only harmful to the privilege that some men and women have. 

In my opinion feminists do a good job in terms of fighting against sexual violence and spreading awareness about that topic. People that fell victim to such a crime do feel like victims but at the same time they often try to blame themselves for it. Personally I think that only a therapist could help these people to overcome their trauma so I don’t know how normal people could give them the support that they need. But  I know one thing for sure and that’s that feminist are fighting against rape culture to prevent that people get away with sexual harassing somebody else."
1489,"People don't like feeling helpless and, to be frank, her feelings aren't about you. It sucks that she's lashing out, but I highly doubt there's any argument you can make to address that. 

Feminism isn't about being a victim, but a lot of people struggle with how to recognize personal power after acknowledging marginalization or abuse (this isn't a problem limited to women or feminism). I would focus on supporting the person and let go of the cause of feminism for the moment-- this person is hurting and that has to be addressed first."
1490,"> She kept claiming that feminism encourages women to see themselves as helpless victims of society 

Feminism is what makes us not helpless. It helps us fight to change our world.

The above is how her views are false. Whether or not you can help her see that is another story. That depends on her, and whether she's willing to listen to you. She probably isn't. And that's not something you can force."
1491,"Patriarchy makes us victims and feminism seeks to change that, but in doing so feminism has to acknowledge that we are victims in the first place. I guess some people confuse that with feminism making us out to be victims and don’t see how feminism is just trying to change that."
1492,I understand that feminism helps us take back our power. I just don’t fully understand how people twist this ideology to make it seem like it creates a wide spread victim mentality. I can’t seem to figure out where in society people see this to confirm this view...hard to get someone to listen when I honestly struggle to grasp her POV
1493,"> I just don’t fully understand how people twist this ideology to make it seem like it creates a wide spread victim mentality.

Me either.

> I can’t seem to figure out where in society people see this to confirm this view.

Nowhere. They're not looking for actual evidence. They're coming up with a fictional story (or sticking with one they heard) that is convenient for emotional reasons.

She's probably afraid of facing her past trauma. Calls fear of facing past trauma ""victim mentality"" (it isn't). She knows feminists will encourage her to face her past trauma so she can start healing from it. She's afraid of that. So she denigrates feminists so that she doesn't have to listen to them push her to face her fear.

She is never, ever, going to listen to evidence about feminism or reasoned arguments if the above is the case. She might listen to encouragement about how facing her past fears will help them go away, or other things that can lead her to healing. But talking about feminism? The rationality behind her beliefs is rooted in deeply-important emotional pain. No amount of evidence or reason will help.

If you know her well, try to get to her to a therapist or support group or some other thing that might help her heal from her past trauma. Don't try to change her mind about feminism."
1494,"I would put Amy Poehler in there: 

*“Amy Poehler was new to SNL and we were all crowded into the seventeenth-floor writers' room, waiting for the Wednesday night read-through to start. [...] Amy was in the middle of some such nonsense with Seth Meyers across the table, and she did something vulgar as a joke. I can't remember what it was exactly, except it was dirty and loud and ""unladylike"",  Jimmy Fallon [...] turned to her and in a faux-squeamish voice said, ""Stop that! It's not cute! I don't like it."" Amy dropped what she was doing, went black in the eyes for a second, and wheeled around on him. ""I don't fucking care if you like it."" Jimmy was visibly startled. Amy went right back to enjoying her ridiculous bit. With that exchange, a cosmic shift took place. Amy made it clear that she wasn't there to be cute. She wasn't there to play wives and girlfriends in the boys' scenes. She was there to do what she wanted to do and she did not fucking care if you like it.”*

Also a pretty huge fan of Michelle Wolf.

1495,Check out Broad City and both Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson as activists and comedians!
1496,"No one can hurt feminism. That's like asking if humour can hurt human rights. A lot of jokes and comedians are sexist, though."
1497,"There are two comedians that I really enjoy: Ali Wong, and Iliza Shlesinger -- both are feminists, and use humor to interrogate their relationship to it (and how they have internalized patriarchal/misogynist/heteronormative behaviors & thought patterns).  At a *very* surface level read, some of their jokes seem to reinforce these negative aspects -- until you get to the part that subverts the norms."
1498,"1) [The Guilty Feminist podcast](https://guiltyfeminist.com/). (So so good).

2) The list of guests from guiltfempod."
1499,Y'all need to watch Tig Notaro and Hannah Gadsby. Both on netflix. I love them both. Had me laughing and crying
1500,"Can a comedian hurt feminism? Dave Chapelle can inspire misogynists to laugh I guess. Mainly, I want to chime in with my feminist comedy recommendation of The Marvelous Mrs Maisel on Prime. Written by Amy Sherman Palladino and phenomenally funny performances by strong female leads (Borstein, Lynch, Brosnahan). Refreshing take on challenging tradition. The male lead is also deeply attracted to strong women, so that’s fun. Modern, hilarious Feminine Mystique."
1501,"I *tentatively* support the podcast by Corinne Fisher and Krystyna Hutchinson called ""Guys We Fucked"". They're two stand-up comedians who talk about their sexual experiences and interview/harangue past lovers in the show. I think their approach to sexual comedy for women is absolutely hilarious and refreshing, however I say ""tentatively"" because there was one episode where their sexualization of a minority made me uncomfortable."
1502,"I’m gonna make perhaps a controversial topic here and that is Amy Schumer. I am not idolizing her or saying she is without flaw, but I am actually grateful we have female comedians like her. A lot of people (men Especially) are claiming she is awful and hate on her for being so vulgar and unfunny and claiming she is bad for feminist case, and she proves women aren’t funny, but I strongly disagree. She is provocative and pushes the boundries for how a woman should act, being as gross as she can with details. A lot of people find this threatening I think. If the problem with her was that she was just unfunny and stole jokes then she would just be ignored. But the problem They have with her is something deeper and I’m pretty sure it’s a woman being obnoxious in a way men feel should be reserved for them. She isn’t trying to be sexy or sweet for the male gaze and it’s infuriating."
1503,"Comedy (in particular stand up) has the ability to point out the absurdity of gender norms and other societal bullshit in a disarming way. So if it is done well it can be can be a really great tool to subverting people's world view just a little bit. That being said it can also be problematic reinforce crappy stereotypes and all  that other crap. So like most mediums, whether it is positive or negative depends on the content and the context. 

I just binged through The Comedy Lineup on netflix and I really liked most of the comedians, all of whom were new to me. I would especially recommend Sam Jay's, Sabrina Jalees's, Emma Willman and Kate Willet episodes if you are looking for talented progressive female comedians."
1504,I’m not familiar with comedians but bojack horseman has some episodes that deal directly with feminist issues in a hilarious way.

1508,"I absolutely adore Amy Poehler. And her [Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls](https://amysmartgirls.com) initiative is so important - it teaches and empowers young women to be their ‘truest selves’ (that is, encouraging them to value intelligence and inquisitiveness over the status quo). I truly think that the character of Leslie Knope is mostly Amy playing herself."
1509,"If we're doing TV shows and not just stand-up, then let's tack Crazy Ex Girlfriend onto that list. Rachael Bloom is amazing."
1510,YESSS! Broad City is epic!
1511,"I agree with you to a degree. I know a lot of humor (memes) shit on feminists and portray them as terrible unattractive dumb people who love to get offended over anything. I think this is to scare girls away from the movement and it seems to be working somewhat. I hear a lot of people say «I believe in equality but I am not a feminist» Which I think is because they don’t want to be associated with this stereotype.

If people who believe in working for human rights don’t want to join together and be identified as someone who works for human rights, it will mean human rights are not taken as serious. That’s why I think this humor is harmful to feminism"
1512,"I feel very conflicted about Iliza Schlesinger. Does she make me laugh? Yup, not gonna lie. Is she hugely problematic? Also yup. When she's addressing women and uses the phrase ""because you have a *girl brain*,"" then goes on with some complete stereotypical garbage, it's hard not to squirm uncomfortably.

Taylor Tomlinson, on the other hand, has quickly become my favourite comic. She's got a special on Netflix. You may as well check that one out if you're stuck at home."

1518,You definitely don't get to make top-level comments here.
1519,Then I ask what is the distinction between a feminist joke and a regular joke? Is it the person that says it? The content of the joke? Do all jokes stem from truth or do none at all?

1523,She said feminist humour 🤷🏻‍♀️Yes Rachel Bloom is great!!
1524,"Great show, I would also like the add the new Harley Quinn show, very feminist and great conversation on abuse, I was shocked when I saw all 3 of the creators were men, though some of the episodes are still written by or directed by women."
1525,"This ""humour"" is a 100 year old smear campaign. I don't care for it."
1526,"I used to find her hilarious but her last special was painful to watch. Not only a lot of the jokes were not funny but had a distinct edge lord-y vibe to them. Ugh.

Nothing is so boring as comedian on stage talking about how they will not let the mean political correct folks stop them. It's like: Ok, we get it. Can you please tell some funny jokes now?"
1527,"That's honestly how I feel about her, as well. Her later specials go deeper into subversions, but her earlier ones are pretty problematic."
1528,"Thanks, I’m not alone. I watched one of her stand ups and she had this joke about drunk women being sheep and she was making bahhh sounds... and I was over it. There are way more (and better) female comedians out there."
1529,"I dunno -- to me, Obama is closer to being a Republican than he is a progressive..."
1530,"That's also kind of the point - she's ridiculously sheltered and privileged, and some of the best moments for me are when she realizes that that isn't what reality looks like for most people, and that she's hurt people with her carelessness. It can get a little old sometimes, though."
1531,Sorry?
1532,"If the person is trying to make a statement and believes what they’re saying. It goes for anything really. For example, racist jokes. Was it meant to be taken lightheartedly or was it meant to be discriminatory?"
1533,What?
1534,"I am a feminist.

Edit* my original comment was “I like Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham”, not sure why the bot deleted my comment. Please fix that."
1535,Me neither. What’s nice is that when you know that it is actually a smear campaign you see right through this humor and it doesn’t affect you.
1536,Those things being true doesn't mean they aren't harmful to the cause though.
1537,Are you talking about Schlesinger or Tomlinson?
1538,"I watched Elder millenial and that joke about going to grocery store when engaged left me speechless like really, I didn't know that feminists are supposed to be enforcing gender stereotypes. And that's just a beginning. I'm just sad that there's no quality female stand up on Netflix, every girl is either 'I'm not like other girls' or a lesbian who's whole identity revolves around her sexuality. Although, I admit that obviously they are allowed to create their own content how ever they feel it's just not for me."

1545,Schlesinger
1546,"Shlesinger makes me sad because she could have been really great. She had this joke about planning break ups in one of her earlier specials that still makes me laugh just thinking about it. When she was making fun of herself and how much she fits into a specific stereotype about middle-class white women she delivered some truly inspired jokes. 

It's a pity."
1547,I’m wondering if you’ve gone so far the other way now because there is a lot of great female comedians on Netflix and not all of them fit a cis straight female character but they are very much great FEMALE comedians. I’m kind of off put by the “there’s no quality female stand up on Netflix” when comedians like Leslie Jones and Fortune Feimster have released specials in the last few months. Tig and Tiffany Haddish have shown sides of comedy on Netflix that are quality and also very unique to themselves. I don’t like that one girl but overall I am supportive of most female comedians who don’t put other women down in their jokes and would never support a statement that suggest non cis straight comedians aren’t included in female content.
1548,He's a neoliberal.  I think (hope) we're going through a re-alignment right now that will have future generations evaluating him as further right than we see him now.  This is true of most politicians though I suppose...
1549,"Yeah, it's pretty over the top there, and she didn't seem to learn much from it. I'm still kinda hopeful we'll get a character arc that shows her improving, though, especially after the end of last season..."
1550,"Words can’t hurt. Unless they’re a serious objective threat of violence, then there’s potential harm. But words themselves don’t hurt, actions do."
1551,"It **is** up for debate. You don’t get to decide what I believe, and people change. I have converted to feminism and you’re out of line. You’re on a power trip. Everyone in this sub is my friend and you *always* hated my success."
1552,"I don't understand. You don't think people exist who are influenced by these ""jokes"" ?"
1553,"Well it is. 
When I was a teenager I only knew about feminism via popculture. To my own embarrassment I have to admit: I was one of those „I don’t need feminism because I am not as whiny and oversensitive as the other girls, I‘m a *cool girl ^tm*“
I only got around to it we’ll in my twenties. So yeah, the smear campaign is real and it matters because it worked (at least on me)"
1554,"Dunno, seems to me like they're only playing out their stereotyped roles, especially Lesli and Fortune Feimster (angry black women and fat southern chick) and that's not funny to me. On the other hand, I understand that people love them and find them funny, and that's GOOD, although it seems that Netflix stand up section in general isn't my cup of tea."
1555,"Libel and slander are crimes. Being verbally abusive to your significant other is a crime. Verbal abuse in labeled as such because it inflicts pain/damage on the victim. It is objectively true that words can hurt.

To be honest, my first instinct was to make a hurtful joke to demonstrate. But that’s a dick move and I think people should be nicer to each other on the internet."
1556,"oh my God, okay"
1557,"No, I think these jokes are so obvious old bullshit, people will figure them out- if they don't live under a rock. It's only those who feel better about themselves to believe they are true will who go on to be ""influenced"" by them. Most deliberately use them to keep the upper hand. I don't waste my time on them."
1558,We all were at that point until our twenties or 30s. Nothing new or special.
1559,Did you watch Leslie Jones's special? She did not come off as angry to me at all. I thought she was great!
1560,Were talking jokes here. Do jokes cause harm?
1561,"Nah, I got to know some women as young as 15 already engaging with feminism and lgbtq+ topics. 
Also just because something is the norm it’s not automatically the best case.

Edit: also I didn’t claim it was new or special. On the contrary I tried to argue from my own experience since I thought it’s maybe a shared experience for some. So actually my example being nothing „new or special“ is rather underlining it."
1562,"If they express a shitty/rude opinion that is directly insensitive to someone’s identity, yeah, they do."
1563,That’s why I made the distinction between if it’s a statement and if they actually believe it or not.
1564,"Whether they believe it or not, the reception is the same, don’t you agree?"
1565,"What is happening during the current crisis is that underlying gender inequalities are revealed. Women already took over a disproportionate share of unpaid care work before, be it with children or older family members.

Previously some of that care was taken over by things like schools, day care, etc. Now with many people staying home women have to increasingly do both that care work as well as paid work simultaneously.

So the issue is not that the people who cared about feminism before don't care about it now. The issue is that feminism hasn't finished its work yet. This crisis does not show that feminism isn't needed. Instead it shows how much it is needed."
1566,"Manosphere types keep meme-ing that women all run away from responsibility and expect men to take care of them in a crisis, but that's flatly untrue. Women make up nearly two-thirds of minimum wage workers, many of whom are considered essential and are still required to work. Women are doctors, nurses, care workers, and other people who are on the front lines of this thing. The idea that feminism suddenly becomes unpopular and extraneous when women are faced with a crisis is an insulting fantasy.

Also? The only article that I read was a headline that said ""the Coronavirus is bad for feminism"" is making almost the exact point that everybody else here is making, not the point that you seem to think it's making."
1567,"No I think that the current crisis has revealed what Feminists have said all along, which is that some of the most important and fundamental jobs in society are disproportionally done by women ie. Healthcare, childcare, education, care of the elderly and disabled."
1568,During that pandemic it has also been brought up that conservative agendas are being pushed at the expense of women and women's rights. Abortion has been declared an elective surgery meaning that if you needed to get one under the current covid-19 legislation you couldn't.
1569,"Huh?  A lot of women work in medicine, as doctors, nurses, medical researchers, etc - biology and related careers is one of the STEM fields more women go into in the ‘easy affluent’ societies that men.  I don’t see all these women staying home.  Women work in the grocery stores and a lot of the still essential businesses that are open.  In what way could you argue that women are wanting to go back to traditional gender roles?  Sounds like a weak manosphere fantasy divorced from reality."
1570,"Citation for the first question needed! 

Second question is low-effort bait. Don’t bother y’all"
1571,"I don't understand what your second question means, even if I try to fill it in 

""men all <eat puppies> women most affected""

I just don't get it"
1572,"Well, if you fight for survival, social issues aren't priority.

But wars and emergency help women and poor people with emancipation. After WW2, it were women who rebuilt Europe as many men were captive, injured or dead. During and after industrial revolution, women took up paid work. Feminism is also class struggle. In quiet times, we can better contemplate about a vision while at turbulent times, we can just act on what we got."
1573,"> There have been a few articles that have been along the lines of ""corona virus has been bad for feminism"". The idea being the second there is a problem that makes life hard people go back to the more traditional gender norms and ways or stop caring about feminism. 

&#x200B;

Can you share any of those articles?  Because this sounds like complete nonsense."
1574,It isn't. Some of the greatest advancements for women came in conjunction with the Russian revolution. Russia was a poor agrarian society caught up in the most devastating war the world had ever seen and yet people still called for feminism.
1575,"Angela Davis (Women, Race, and Class)
and Engels (The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State ) would say differently."
1576,"I think you have a really good point.
In the current crisis we stay at home and a lot of women are tasked with „the domestic“ work already. Times like the crisis now only bring out the underlying gender normative structures even more. 

The same goes for the holiday season. A friend of mine recently hypothesized that domestic abuse rates are higher in those seasons because there is the expectation placed on women to make it more homely and festive while men are at home more. The live shifts more into the private so to say, which is seen as the women’s sphere.

Sorry for my grammar in advance. English isn’t my first language."
1577,"And like on top of that: I’ve seen plenty of women doing the grocery shopping for themselves and those who can’t, and going out to get essentials. They’re still expected to do these things even though it raises their risk of infection.

So while there’s a real tangible risk women still go out and do stuff to keep everything running."
1578,"I've seen a lot of ""women's standards for men will drop due to them needing help during Corona virus"" and...yeah, nothing has changed in my circle. Most of my female friends work in healthcare and tech and are financially independent"
1579,"I think maybe what might be happening though is that, while there may be a lot of women on the front lines, no one really cares that they are women.  It has become all doctors and nurses and restaurant workers etc. are heroes and the emphasis is on humans rather than women specifically.  There aren't articles coming out about business women being bosses and no headlines about women who have accomplished something for science.  A woman doing something heroic or great isn't a win for women anymore, it's a win for humanity and there is less emphasis on the gender.  So maybe the effect is that we are just hearing less about women specifically, though I would almost consider that a win for feminism?"
1580,"> Sounds like a weak manosphere fantasy divorced from reality.

They were *really* hoping this would cause that massive societal collapse they've been salivating for."
1581,"I think it's a complaint that if, say, a tragedy were to happen that resulted in the deaths of many men, women would still receive media spotlight as the *real* victims/focus on how women were affected, with nary a word for the men who died."

1583,"It's actually a really good article - but it doesn't say that people stop caring about feminism, but rather discusses the societal pressure that disasters put on women because they're seen as ""carers"" and that disasters magnify existing inequalities because the focus of society shifts to the urgent matter at hand.

1585,"Yesterday I was reading an AskReddit thread about how people were doing during the pandemic and I stumbled across a chain of comments amongst married men with children who suddenly had to stay home 24 hours a day. They were saying that their wives were nurses or other essential workers who still worked each day outside the home. They all agreed amongst themselves that they had NEVER meant to stay home with the kids all day and that they hated it. These men went on to discuss how awful they thought it was and how much they hated staying home and caring for their own children and homes during a pandemic. One guy said that now that he knew what it was like to stay home with the kids all day, and now that he knows his wife would really go to work and make him take the responsibility of his OWN children, that he regrets everything and plans to get a divorce after all of this is over. He would rather leave his wife and children than ever take the chance of having to be a stay at home parent again!

Women have been forced into this role for millennia and men tell us we should be grateful. Men try it for one week and they are willing to destroy their entire family for a chance to escape. And these men were so selfish to say that it was a job that they NEVER wanted, but they were happy to force their wife to do it instead. 

The other men in the thread said they agreed with him and were so relieved to hear someone say it!

And all of these men in the comments were just saying they could get a divorce and opt out of the whole thing without admitting or acknowledging that their plan meant that they were just going to dump every single one of those unwanted duties on their wife’s lap and just hit the road, carefree as a bird. 

They hate the job so much, yet they don’t think twice about forcing it all into their life partner. Or, soon to be ex life partner, lol. 

If this is a job that they hate so much that they can’t even do it for a week, what must they think of their wives that they would unthinkingly ask them to do it every day forever? Does even a small part of their inner mind ever stop to wonder what their poor wives think about doing all of these things all of the time with no chance to escape? It’s just so selfish and cruel. Why would you ask your life partner to do a job that you personally don’t think is worth doing?

I also wonder if they just never plan to see their children again, because if they plan to see them for more than an hour or two at a time, they will need to do at least some “child care “. 

I don’t think they’ve considered that the less time your children spend in your home the more you pay in monthly child support."
1606,"While I think there may be some over reactions on the parts of those men, I would also say in fairness to them that they likely did not sign up to be stay at home dads in the first place and the same way no one can force a woman to be a stay at home mom, neither can that be forced on them and if they choose to pursue divorce over that so be it.

The criticism is also disingenuous because if your spouse is a nurse, doctor or other essential worker then in all likelyhood they  were not ""staying home with the kids"" before all of this anyway. What's more likely is the kid was in daycare or some other provision was being made.

Regardless, people have a right to make their own decisions and in some cases, including when it comes to children it is in fact often one party that drives the decision. My last long term gf and I broke up largely over the fact that I did not want a child at least at that time because i wanted to prioritise my career at the time. For her, she wanted a 2nd child (she had a daughter from a previous relationship) as she felt her biological clock was running out. I  stood my ground because I was unwilling to be honest. A child and what that would entail was not what I wanted at that time. It was what ultimatly led us down the path to separation and thats fine because while she has a right to seek what makes her happy I also have that right.

To the others commenting on those men having to pay mountains of child support that is frankly not a disincentive per say because I know several men who are paying such support as a result of divorces their wives filed for. In at least 2 cases I'm very familiar with it was the wife that was caught cheating and then decided to file for divorce. So you can end up paying a mountain of support even when its not your fault. At least in this case it would be their decision."

1611,I imagine that this type of person is also the type of person who assumes women naturally gravitate towards homemaking and childcare and men naturally do not; therefore it makes sense that he thinks it is horrible and the wife wouldn't mind.
1612,"You also shouldn't be having kids you can't raise though. You can't ""sign up for"" being a dad or a mom with the condition of never having to take care of the kids if you're at home for an extended period of time and there's nowhere for them to be. These dad's were never dad's in the first place, just dudes who liked the idea of having kids."
1613,"Of course people have the right to make their own decisions. The issue here is that, given an extraordinary situation that forces everyone to do things outside of their normal routine (that was presumably agreed to), these husbands are considering abandoning their wives and children. The wives are not forcing their husbands to become stay-at-home dads. Their work is considered essential and must be done on-site, so they really have little choice in the matter either. The husbands' work is either not deemed essential or can be done from home, and the kids can't go to school or daycare. Given that situation, the rational thing to do would be to suck it up and do whatever you can to ensure that everything gets taken care of - both the husbands and the wives - until the situation is resolved and they can go back to their agreed-upon roles. Instead, these men are contemplating abandoning their families, permanently. I don't think it's disingenuous to criticize that view.

To put it another way, if the wives were suddenly trying to force the husbands to become stay-at-home dads against their will, then these men would have a valid complaint. The wives in that situation would be trying to take decisions away from the husbands, and that might end up being legitimate grounds for divorce. But that's not what's happening here. This is an external situation that has severely (and temporarily) reduced the options that are available to each person. Nobody is the ""bad guy"" here, it's just a shitty situation that needs to be handled in an adult manner."
1614,"They might not have signed up for being stay-at-home dads, but they did sign up for marriage and for having kids. A decent person would be able to buckle down and do the job that they willingly signed up for, especially since being a “stay-at-home dad” would be a temporary hardship. 

If the genders were reversed, (male health care worker, female being forced to stay at home with kids) no one would be crying, “hey! You can’t force a woman to be a stay at home mom!” Because it’s obviously a temporary arrangement forced upon families due to unforeseen circumstances.

Also when it comes to child support, it does not matter who is at fault for the divorce- the reason child support exists is not to reward one parent and punish the other, it is to ensure that the child gets adequate financial support."
1615,"Wow, what courage. Next thing you know they will try and make the argument that since women can control their own body and have access to abortion, they should also be allowed to abort their 7 year old and not pay child support either.

The cognitive dissonance is astounding. I don’t think I could be in a relationship with someone I felt that way about. Hell, I own a small business and I couldn’t even *employ* someone I felt that way about.

1619,"Only those persons can decide for them selves how important or not those considerations are no matter how irrational or selfish they may be perceived.

 There have always been women who for example will leave a man if they experience a financial down turn. You can make your judgements in either case but that does not mean it's not a reality. Frankly, all you are seeing right now is a role reversal in how the irrational response to a change in circumstance is being applied (specifically in this case its cutting the other way) and while it may be surprising to women its something men have always experienced all be it in a different way."
1620,"Ref the child support:
 agreed obviously no fault divorce is the standard I was replying to the comment that these men should be ""punished with heavy child support"" and pointing out that this can happen regardless of the reason for the separation so its hardly a stick to wield as it's a fate that can befall even a man holding up his end of the deal so to speak.

I think what I am getting at here is while this is an irrational reaction, generally we allow irrational reactions under the guise of ""at the end of the day you cannot force people, they have to so what makes them happy"" it's just that much of the time this is applied to women. I'm saying that in this case it's as valid a choice for these men. You dont get to condone one then say ""man up"" in this case."

1624,"Well, you said our criticism was disingenuous, and I explained why it's not. I would also probably criticize a woman who left a man solely because he had a financial downturn, if that's really the only reason. Both of these situations expose deeper issues with the leaver's motives for getting married in the first place. A woman who sees a husband purely as a free meal ticket doesn't get my sympathy any more than a man who sees a wife purely as a housekeeper and child bearer. Both are examples of objectification.

Of course, there have been periods in history when a woman was not able/allowed to earn money or hold property, and there are still many places in the world where there are varying degrees of legal inequity for men's and women's property rights. In those situations there may be a greater financial component to a woman's decision to marry or to leave a husband - but let's be honest, those situations don't usually favor the woman."
1625,"I’m not following you. What have men “always experienced albeit in different ways”? I’m honestly asking, because your comment doesn’t make it clear."
1626,No one supports women who choose to have several children and then abandon them. Where are you seeing this?
1627,"Yeah I have literally never said “man up” and I will never say these men should “man up”. I don’t understand where you’re getting the impression of a double standard here. 

I do think that they should “adult up”. As in- you are an adult, you agreed to get married, and you agreed to have children. Those children are a responsibility that you *signed up for* and when unforeseen circumstances occur that mean you have to then take care of those children that are *your and your partner’s shared responsibility*, you need to be an adult and take care of those children. That is regardless of gender. 

It is not realistic that in life you will be happy all the time- sometimes things in life happen that we have no control over. I don’t think it’s reasonable at all to say, “I’m not happy, I need to leave” when it’s a temporary situation. Like if your partner loses their job, you’re not going to say “I didn’t sign up for being the sole provider” because they’re looking for work for a month or two. Where that would be reasonable is if it is no longer a temporary arrangement, and they are not looking for work. Then it would be fair to say, “I didn’t sign up for this.”

That said, of course it is their choice to leave. I don’t doubt that this whole situation is putting a lot of stress on relationships, and that it’s exposing a lot of cracks. 

Let them leave. But if they leave during this crisis, they should understand that since their partner has an essential job and will be working outside of the home, they will still likely be the primary caregiver, unless they want to forfeit all custody of their children. But in that case, they *should* pay more in child support - because they are not contributing support in any way that is not financial. 

In my opinion a man “holding up his end of the deal” would be providing more than just financial support to his kids. That’s really the bare minimum. It is also uncommon for a man to be paying “heavy child support” in cases where custody, parental responsibilities, and duties are split evenly."

Travel is an integral part of his job and his wife would have known that even before they got married but he was mostly home due to his having fairly high seniority at the company. His wife told him that he had to follow the position for the time being as their lifestyle had to be maintained. Two months in she informed him she was filing for divorce as she did not sign up for an absentee husband. She married a pilot, did she think that he might never have to spend more than 1 or 2 nights away?

But I don’t have any numbers to back that up.

It’s sexist to treat all women like sex toys as well. If someone exclusively seeks hookups... they better be very up front about it and they better not be like.., letting that view of women (or men, whatever gender really) bleed into the rest of their life.

I might enjoy the performance, I might not, but I am not going to say that every time a woman does something she necessarily must try to speak for women as a whole, as that would be impossible to do.

Well these beauty standards have been often discussed already so I’m not gonna get into it too much but I think that even women/girls that meet these „requirements“ could be insecure about their bodies. At least I knew a few of them that felt this way. Seeing a certain celebrity beeing „thick“ definitely empowered some girls that had similar bodies.

1679,"Just a personal thought, curious if it gels with anyone, but if anyone feels sexy and wants to show it off, that’s their right I think. In a way I think the same goes for art. Someone wants to paint or film or photograph a pretty person and everyone consents, then great. I would say it even extends to porn.

That said, this would only be valid in a perfect world. I think the problem lies in its commercialization. It’s not “a person feeling sexy or pretty and showing off” so much as it is “here is a naked person, give us money.” As well as “we want money, you there employee! Do something sexy and let us make art out of it so we can make money! You don’t want to? To bad I won’t give you money if you don’t!” We’re oversaturated with sexual objectification and I think we’ve become such an indulgent society that we’re blind to how it’s hurting everyone. If porn was just a performance between willing participants and it was safe and respectful? Awesome. If someone feels saucy and poses for a painting or performs their sexy dance? That’s their choice and good for them. It’s just... since we’re stuck in a not so perfect world, it’s hard to tell what is and isn’t artistry vs expression?

1683,"Oh, yeah, I would agree.  When there is a massive amount of industry pressure to do a specific kind of performance, it stops being so clear as to what is a real artistic choice and what is working within the demands of the industry.  Then it becomes a question of who do we hold most accountable -- the artists or the industry?  Some might try to argue that if women just didn't do sexual performances, the industry would adapt and they'd be fine and would point to a pop artist like Billie Eilish, and so it's the fault of the women choosing to do sexual performances.  However, I don't quite buy that.  We've always had female artists who were not necessarily doing sexualized performances, or at least not sexualized in a conventional way -- Annie Lennox, Salt-n-Pepa (who did amazing sex-positive songs and talked about sex plenty, but they weren't catering to a male gaze), Adele, Sia, etc.  And then a lot gets made about them not being the 'traditional sexy pop stars,' which kind of reinforces this notion that if a woman does do a sexy performance, she's 'asking for it' since see, these other women didn't, when really, it is rarely that simple."

1685,"There are three related things he's getting at here.

First, he is discussing the pervasive objectification of women in our society.  Men are actors, they have agency, they make decisions and do things.  Women are objects, they are acted upon by men and do not made decisions or do things independently.  Obviously that's a massive generalization, but we're talking at a broad level about societal *narratives*, not trying to describe every real-world interaction.

Second, he is discussing the emphasis on women's physical appearance.  Because women are  objectified, we are valued more for our appearance than our actions.  One of the primary ways men act upon women is to look at us and appraise our appearance.

Third, as a result of objectification and male gaze being pervasive in our society, women internalize those narratives and begin to see ourselves as objects.  We see men look at us, and we anticipate their gaze by seeing ourselves as they will see us.  We are hyper-aware of our appearance to others - the space we take up, the way our body is positioned, how attractive others will find us (obligatory not all women, still speaking very broadly).

1688,"Thank you for this! So,, if I'm understanding correctly, society has the view that a man can do what he wants and a woman can not?

Yes, he is discussing society at large in terms of both people's beliefs (how they think men and women should behave an relate to each other) and their actions (how men and women actually behave and relate to each other).  It doesn't mean that everyone acts this way all the time, but it means that it is pervasive."

Do you think that makes sense?"

1706,"All very valid points, but I think you may have misunderstood OP’s question. The problem you talked about in point 2 is the one OP is trying to answer; OP is wondering why feminists have to refer men to these spaces- there’s not enough advertisement about them for men to go straight there themselves. For example, you know the people that constantly come on here saying “well what do you want to do about the fact that male suicide rates are 3X higher than women” and we have to be like “while some of the issues feminists are trying to solve will benefit men too (e.g. abolishing traditional gender roles), feminists are not here specifically to fix men’s problems, you should probably go check out Men’s Lib.” The problem is that we constantly have to refer people there rather than them already knowing about it, which is why OP is asking about the lack of awareness for movements and subs like that.

About point 1, I think OP was saying that feminist spaces are the wrong space for men to discuss men’s problems."

1709,"The person who is pregnant has the sole control of their medical decisions, so unless the man is the one pregnant, he can't make someone else's medical decisions for them."
1710,"If the man and the woman are couple or at the very least on positive terms then I would say the sensible thing for the two to do would be to discuss and talk it over together.

If the man wants to put forward the option of taking over all parental responsibilities and to 100% of the raising of the child he can do that. Basically the woman gives birth, hands the child over and is done bar child support. BUT fundamentally the decision on whether to abort or not has to rest on the person who is actually pregnant. I reject utterly the idea of one person being able to require someone to stay pregnant if they do not want to be.

It cannot ever be other than the pregnant person final decision."
1711,"People make decisions for their own bodies. Men control their sperm and women control their uteruses. Men do not get to ALSO get decisions about womens uteruses. 


Parental laws are gender neutral already. If a child exists both parents are responsible for it."
1712,"> In the case of a woman and man deciding to have unprotected sex, and the woman gets pregnant and wants an abortion, do you believe that the man should get a say in the matter?

He should not get to change the choice. He can, of course, have an opinion (and should) - so long as the pregnant woman is free to ignore that opinion (she may, if she wants, take his attitude towards being a parent into account -but she doesn't have to). Reason: in no circumstance should he have control over what she does with her body.

> Do you believe that he should be allowed to make the choice if he wants to have a child or not?

No. Reason: he's not pregnant, it's not his body. The only difference here is the question of whether or not to terminate a pregnancy - everything else is equal. Only pregnant people get to make that decision."
1713,"No, the woman is one one in danger of dying in childbirth, and deals with all the medical associated with pregnancy. The man goes through none of this, therefore doesn't get a say in the matter."
1714,"They can talk about it, but ultimately no. Only the woman has the right to decide weather she wants the fetus in her body.

 That's sad for him, but it's so much better than letting somebody force someone else to endure pregnancy.






However I do advocate giving men more choice in weather to have children when it doesn't infringe upon the rights of women. I think that if a man wanted a fetus to be aborted (but the woman did not agree) he should not have to be legally tied to the resulting child and be forced to financially support it. I don't think that's fair to him, and I don't think that having an absent father who just pays child support is better for the kid than being covered by an adequate welfare system.

The dude isn't really responsible for that kid, but collectively we are all responsible for ensuring that all children in our society have adequate resources."
1715,"This is why I just think a man and a woman shouldn’t have sex without fully discussing and *agreeing with each other* on what to do if the woman gets pregnant.

Yes, there’s always the possibility of one of them changing their minds later on, and I can’t really blame them, as emotions and hormones can strongly affect our thoughts and opinions on a matter. Which is ALSO why I just think it’s a good idea to wait to have sex until your brain is fully matured. The possibility of emotional/hormonal factors changing your mind after that still exists, yes, but the probability is lowered.

I know the likelihood of everyone following that stance is extremely low, but I still think our society would be much better off if everyone did.

Anyways…

If the woman *did* get pregnant and the couple disagreed on what to do, I do believe the woman should get the ultimate choice in the matter, for all the reasons that other commenters have already mentioned. Although, I do agree that the man’s opinion should be heard and taken heavily into consideration by the woman."

1717,"""No uterus, no opinion."" The father isn't affected in the same the mother is and doesn't risk death, injury, financial security by bringing another being into this world and bears no responsibility for the way the baby's body and mind develop during those 9 months. He's entitled to whatever feelings he has over abortion. Unless transhumanists' dream about external pregnancies or baby-transfers into the fathers' bodies becomes a thing, the father shouldn't control the mother's body and neither shame nor force her to go through with the pregnancy."
1718,"He can have an *opinion* and *talk* to her about it, but no, he can't override her medical decision."
1719,so the woman could decide to compel the man to years and years of child support without him having a say in it? seems scary.

When the guy will statistically do 30% of the care load and believe he is contributing equally leaving her with less free time than him and consequentially, more exhausted and more stressed overall.

Not to mention the actual health risks of carrying out the pregnancy of which he will most likely tell her not to share any gross details, refuse to help her pay for doctors appointments and treatments because it's ""her problem"" will be unprepared should post partem depression happen, and will be upset and annoyed that he can't have sex with her right after she gave birth.

1745,"Greetings from a land where the top 3 offices are held by women. This is not the first time that has happened.

I think the US's problem here is a combination of misogyny and the historic glass ceiling.

The US has fallen behind other developed countries. It hasn't done the work on dismantling barriers that specifically disadvantage women - eg no paid parental leave - so where women are supremely competent they are held back.

I think part of the problem is the massive cognitive dissonance between constitutional rights and politics in the US. For example, the constitution guarantees freedom of religion but that guarantee only seems to apply to Christianity. Organisations and individuals are often permitted to oppress others to protect their own freedom of religion, eg the Hobby Lobby. And nothing is more oppressive to women than the interference of religion in matters of state.

Additionally, US society operates in a sort of a weird chamber where no one seems to be able to hear the results of what they voted for. The commercial interests of the wealthy rule politics. Freedom appears to be available only to those who can afford to purchase it.

Certainly of the 5 countries I've lived in, the most extraordinarily sexist experiences of my life were in the US.

Just to cheer you all up, have some [Jacinda on Facebook Live](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/26/world/jacinda-ardern-facebook-coronavirus-scli-intl/index.html) checking in on the people of New Zealand in coronavirus lockdown from her couch."

1750,"If you ask me this is one of those issues where the influence of religion on sexism is highly relevant.  I think we can all see quite plainly that religion has a very strong influence on the US population in particular, and religion as an institution can be, and usually is, very sexist.  If anyone asks you for an example of institutionalized sexism, just say ""religion"" and drop your mic.  We actually waive all the rules regarding gender discrimination for the clergy and for all that the stereotype goes that women are supposed to be nurturers and great at communicators, the people who advocate for that stereotype as if it's real are also likely to consider it heresy for a woman to be a priest.

Naturally, this has an influence on how people vote, both indirectly by virtue of the fact that a large section of the population goes to a mass gathering which is led by a man every week, and also indirectly, because churches can and do favour certain candidates and have ways of making their preferences known.

There's also a thing where the processes that allow upcoming politicians to network involves something of a boy's club, but this isn't especially unique in the US, and it's more a part of the explanation for why we don't see candidates to vote for in the first place.  Also of course it's exacerbated by the issue of how strongly religion influences politics in the US."
1751,"I agree with the other people here. We hold women up to a higher standard compared to male candidates.

But I do believe that people are seeking to elect a woman. My group of friends and I were Warren supporters, because we felt the need woman to be in office. But we saw that majority of her campaign relied on identity politics and she had difficulty answering questions about her policies. Majority of the group ended up switching to Bernie and Yang.

I think it has to do with the candidates we have been given. But then again we ended up with Biden, so it’s very clear that misogyny holds women up to a higher standard."

There's a really fine line  to walk. I mean just the fact that we are having this conversation is proof. Imagine if in TV they openly said ""Do you think a Mexican can ever be elected?""

There’s a lot we need to change even in our own system . Hilary had people blaming her for her husbands past as well as her own . Warren is considered crazy and wild even to many feminists . And women listen before we speak and are often spoken over.

1756,"On general terms, sexism, misogyny, the myth of ""electability"", etc. — much of what other people already described in previous comments.

Yet, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, she wasn't elected because of the lack of a progressive agenda, not being able to unite the Democratic Party, not having policies that were in the interest of the working class. We cannot fall for identity politics/identitarianism. It is not enough to have women in leadership positions; we need women with progressive or revolutionary agendas in all levels of government."

I'm speaking from a feminist foreigner's POV and whoever wins the election will affect the world nonetheless. I don't think choosing on the base of someone's sex or identity alone is good. Look at Yang, he's claimed to be progressive and an ally to feminist but who he ended up endorsing despite belonging to a marginalised group himself? I'm queer myself and by this logic, I should've shown support to Yang but politics is more complicated than that and someone's identity doesn't belong to some kinda hive-mind.

With Hillary, it was different - she was the absolute favorite of the DNC, and everyone considered her suitable, electable, capable.

You guys already proved you ARE willing to elect women - just not JUST for being women, but for also being the most convincing candidate. More than half of voters voted for a woman as president!"
1781,Marianne Williamson is crackers though. Imagine somebody like that being in charge of health policy.
1782,"> Warren is considered crazy and wild even to many feminists

how about we don't just say this like it's a given"
1783,"How exactly do you differentiate between ""sexism"" and ""the remnants of sexism""?"
1784,"Also, the weird thing about this is that there's not really any way that Bill Clinton is meaningfully better than Hillary, and she's not a creep sexually the way he is. The criticisms of Hillary that I agree with like being too centrist, too rich, too into war, and terrible about mass incarceration stuff, are all things that are true of Bill too. And yet he managed get elected president for two terms. It's not like George Bush was better than Hillary Clinton, either."

1792,"I'm just some random guy on the internet, and I'm certainly not an authority on this issue... I don't really think it's my place to tell feminists what they ""should"" do lol


There are already quite a few feminist organisations dedicated to electing more women in the US (Emilys List and NOW come to mind). I don't know if they're focused on restructuring the voting process itself, though, that's definitely something to look into. Maybe someone's already started!"
1793,"Elecatability is a sham, it just doesn't exist, it's a media trick to make the uninformed vote for who the elites want."
1794,I'm curious about that too. In my opinion sexism is a symptom to a problem that can't be fixed by simply adding more women and or making it equal. The problem is the system itself.
1795,"Women are no more or less likely to vote for a woman, but men are less likely to vote for a woman.

Source: study cited in FiveThirtyEight podcast"
1796,We are very sexist. Source: lived in Germany for 6 years and was always shocked to discover men were listening to me. As if what I said mattered. I didn’t notice it in the states - it’s so ingrained. I noticed it when men would be waiting for my response...it felt so strange not to have to...entertain or impress or something. Hard to describe.
1797,"I mean, there a lot a of reasons-- the main one seems to be voter fears about how 'viable' other voters feel a woman candidate really is. Lots of voters say they want a woman president, but when presented with a woman candidate, they never make it through. How the media reacts too and discusses women candidates is a component of this, but I also think that there's something about the fact that it's only a handful of women that make it to a point politically that they could run-- to work in politics for a long enough period of time that you'd have the network and finances to run a presidential campaign requires a huge amount of compromises, which tend to leave candidates open for attack later as ""hypocrites"" or ""flip-floppers"" (why people demonstrating that they are capable of learning and changing over time is a bad thing in US politics I honestly don't know if I really understand).

Additionally, we don't have publicly funded campaigns at the national level and that makes a huge difference in terms of the kinds of resources or connections someone has to have to even run in the US-- this isn't the case in a lot of other countries, and notably countries that have better representation. I think it's important, too, to point out that Obama, as a young senator and relative nobody in politics, was really both a surprise candidate and surprise winner-- it's not common for someone with so little government experience, connections, etc to run a campaign like that-- like it literally happens maybe once a generation-- to get the first woman into office, something similar will have to happen and the circumstances that led to Obama's success have definitely changed but people are still trying to use that model-- when what voters want is to feel connected, energized, and like the person going into the office couldn't be easily swapped for someone else-- that's hard to do for any career politician, and doubly hard for the very small # of women who work in politics long enough to have any real name recognition.

To compound that issue, even though our male senators and congress people make those same compromises, collectively we tend to be more forgiving and understanding when they make mistakes, said things in the past that are no longer appropriate, etc.

We are able to write it off as, 'it's just politics' or 'it's just business'-- for women, this same behavior is treated as inexcusable, abhorrent, and deeply inappropriate. If a woman candidate is too authentically herself, too human-- then she's not serious enough for the office, she's unqualified. 

It's hard for me to put into words because it's cultural and historical and circumstantial-- some of the most recent US woman candidates just haven't been that exciting because the demographics of democratic voters-- and their priorities and interests-- are currently shifting away from the political focus and preferences of the Democratic Party-- the same thing happened to the Republican party a few years ago, and that party basically caved to what was previously ""The Tea Party"" and that's how we got into the situation we're currently in-- DNC watched that happen and is actively trying to 'counter' those changes to maintain itself as an institution, and it remains TBD how that's all going to turn out."
1798,"Agreed. If women actually voted as a block, we’d run the place."
1799,And there is a simple answer.
1800,"Maybe they have a different type of misogyny, or it could be that they are elected as [a last resort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_cliff) when the government is in turmoil."
1801,Which countries?
1802,"\*I think that for whatever reason, the overwhelming majority of democrat  voters (of whom a majority is female!) were not sold on these women for  one reason or another, and ended up preferring Biden or Sanders.\*

...you know that the ""reason"" to this can still be influenced misogyny, right? Both societal and internalized."
1803,I was referencing a few articles I’ve seen. I’m not saying everyone views her that way. Several of the people in my family were heartbroken when she suspended her campaign
1804,"Sexism still exists today, sure. But not nearly to the degree that it did one hundred years ago. Sexism will always exist, just to varying degrees."
1805,Bill Clinton was elected 20 years ago.  I think it’s very likely that the electorate had moved further left than Clinton had in the intervening years.
1806,I don’t disagree with that haha they’re all shit
1807,How is what I said not feminist?
1808,This seems very biased.
1809,"You make a good point about Obama, and I think that's partially why AOC has gained such a national profile. Democrats sees her as a potential progressive, female Obama, and Republicans are afraid they're right."
1810,"Why on earth is this even a question or debatable for you?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elected_and_appointed_female_heads_of_state_and_government"
1811,Probably not Warren comprimised on her positions and Hillary won the popular vote
1812,So why are you comfortable calling sexism today “remnants”?  Do you think it’s just kind of the best it’s going to get?
1813,"In some ways it's better, of course bc women gained rights but, at the same time women entering the workforce exposed women to alot MORE sexism bc men felt encroached upon and felt the need to STILL remind us of ' our place'. Post Trump, I feel like sexism is worse than I've ever imagined, men don't even try to hide it anymore and with the attempt to rollback women's reproductive rights back into the fifties, a rapist president and Kavanaugh..you gotta be kidding me..lol."

1815,"It’s AskFeminists. People who are coming here to AskFeminists, rather than to AskReddit or any other ask sub, are coming here because they want to get the opinions of ... wait for it ... *feminists.* If you make a direct reply to them when you are not a member of the group being asked, you are being rude to the OP and not respecting their choice to ask a particular group of people.

1816,"Oh sorry if I came off rude, I was just legitimately curious"
1817,"Probably still yes, because that's how societal and internalized biases work. It doesn't have to be the whole reason but it can still be a major factor in influencing candidates. Hillary was a victim of sexism during the election even among democrats AND a ridiculous voting system (and she wasn't even my choice, btw). 

And Warren has done what literally every other politician has done since the beginning of politics."
1818,"Goodness gracious. That’s the point you want to focus on? Like, I get it; it just seems as if our time would be used better elsewhere. 

Remnants compared to not being able to vote, to not being able to speak as a human being. Sexism exists, it will always exist. But it is a remnant to its former self. That is not to say it doesn’t exist."
1819,How are any of my posts anti feminist?
1820,"No worries, I was curious as well  - I just don't understand how the view of the US is considered (here on this sub) more sexist than Bhutan, Rwanda, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India or Pakistan and many others.

It made no sense to me. I was not being rude either - just legit curious"
1821,I find it very troubling that you can't envision a world in which sexism-- literally discrimination against 1/2 of the human population literally just on the basis of their gender-- doesn't exist.
1822,"I’m deeply uncomfortable with your assumption that sexism will always exist, that this is the best it will get, and that sexism now is basically inconsequential because women aren’t literally second class citizens in the eyes of the law."
1823,"> it just seems as if our time would be used better elsewhere.

ugh, don't do this. most of us have absolutely nothing but time right now."
1824,Wow okay I definitely have square brain and can't read apparently. I blame the quarantine. CARRY ON
1825,"I’d love for that to exist! But most likely it won’t in my life lifetime. It’s the goal to aim for, but we must stay constantly vigilant of the reality that ignorance will always exist."
1826,"Nowhere did I state that this is the best it will get. 

I do believe that in my lifetime I will not be able to see sexism or racism completely eradicated. Maybe in a few lifetimes once we continue to raise the next generations of children to see everyone as equals, regardless of race or sex. But, it seems futile to think that every racist or sexist is somehow going to change their minds when they have lived in ignorance for so long. Let them die out, and for now, we continue to strive for equality and make our voices louder than those who hate."
1827,"What law makes women second class? As far as i know there are close to or not any laws ""purposely"" against women. I can to some degree agree with sociatal differences, but nothing that makes women second class, espwcially not by law."
1828,"I work for myself haha I’m busier than ever!

But, I meant that the specifics of the word is not the focus of the point to be made. Its a silly thing to nitpick."
1829,"What is your effort/self-identity as a feminist for if you can't even engage your imagination about a future without oppression? Seriously, it's deeply troubling.

 “There are times when expanding our imagination is what is required. The radical movement has overemphasized the role of activism and underestimated the role of reflection.”

1830,"This defeatism is such trash.  Dream bigger, friend."
1831,“Aren’t”
1832,Wrong.
1833,"I can certainly imagine it, but that’s beyond my control. It will happen eventually, but we are not their yet. Maybe my children may see it, but to expect millions, potentially billions of people to change their ignorant beliefs takes time. For now, we continue to push, to strive, to work for the full liberation, and if I one day choose to have children, what a responsibility I have to instill the values of equality in them."
1834,"How do you see it happening? What can we do to change the minds of millions of of sexists in such a short amount of time? And further, ensure that once such an ideal is achieved, it stays."
1835,"Not going to say how or anything? Just give me a downvote because i dont agree with you. That sounds cool
."
1836,"Well, if your attitude is any kind of metric it certainly will  take several more generations."
1837,"So, like racism, most people aren't actively conscious of their sexism and aren't out there actively asserting a desire to have a sexist identity- those folks are in the minority.   


Most people simply take the status quo for granted-- they assume the way things are is fine pretty much until something happens that changes that perspective-- that might be something sexist happening to them or someone they love, it might be a big event somewhere else in the world, whatever-- but as a feminist you should be actively helping people navigate those moments, not passively waiting around for 'ignorant' people to die (yikes). 

Yes, *some people* are vocally resistant to change and progress-- however, those people are in the minority. The rest can be educated, advocated too, persuaded-- it's not been my personal experience that most 'progressives' of any kind were raised by families who shared those values-- assuming that's the only way to make progress is ignorant and dismissive. 

Of course, changing people's minds doesn't happen in one conversation or through the sharing of one story or fact, but it certainly can and has happened within a single generation."
1838,"It helps to define what patriarchy is. The most basic definition is 'rule by father(s)' -- it's a system in which a select and small group of men have the power, and women and all other men subject to that power.  Depending on the specific patriarchal society, a man may have an easier or harder time becoming a patriarch.  Women closely connected to the patriarchs through marriage or blood may be better off than most people, including a lot of men, but the power still belongs to that select group of men.

So now I'll talk about patriarchy in the US specifically and address some of your points.  The dominant religion in the US is Christianity, particularly Evangelical Christianity, then Catholicism, then mainline Protestantism.  These are all explicitly patriarchal religions, some more than others.  Evangelical Christianity typically doesn't have women leading the church in any capacity, and in Catholicism, the role of women in Church leadership is quite limited.  Mainline Protestant denominations typically do allow women to take part in church leadership.  Evangelical churches have huge, huge political influence in this country, and Christianity as a whole has a significant cultural influence here.  

The conventional family structure in the US is also built on a patriarchal model -- the wife typically takes the husband's last name, the children all have the father's last name, etc.  That our concept of family is a patriarchal one absolutely has an impact on the culture at large.

Now, some things you raised:

Success and presence in universities -- Women attending the same universities as men and having access to the same education is a very new thing.  When my mother graduated from college in 1969, she couldn't graduate from her ideal school since it did not accept women at all.  Instead, she had to go to the 'sister school'.  For women, going to university is seen as more of a necessity for financial success, since it is.  And while it is true that women over all enroll in university more than men and are less likely to drop-out, this is not true across all degrees and disciplines.  Also, some of this change is due to changes in degree requirements for certain fields like education and nursing, which tend to be dominated by women.  If you exclude education and nursing degrees, men outnumber women in degree awards.  Also, men still receive slighthy more financial assistance in terms of scholarships and grants than women do, even if there are fewer of them going.  

Prison sentences -- a patriarchy requires an underclass of men that can be used.  Note how the justice system defines what is criminal and determines punishment.  The white-collar crimes of the men who write the laws are much, much less severely punished than crimes more often committed by men in what gets seen as an underclass.  See the sentencing differences for cocaine and crack for another example.

divorce outcomes, child support -- most of these arrangements are made outside a court setting with no third party at all and are what the men involved agree to.  There are women who pay alimony and child support as well.  If you are going to call the wage gap bull, then so is the custody gap.

Cancer research and healthcare -- a lot of the reason for focused medical research on women is to correct for the gap of decades when research did not include women at all, and even now women are usually not equally represented in clinical trials.  In regard to women spending more on health care, a lot of that has to do with child birth and that women live longer.  Among children (ages 0-18) health care spending is higher for boys than it is for girls;  among the elderly where we see the highest discrepency, much of that is due to nursing home spending."
1839,"Yeah I’m skeptical of the custody/divorce thing.  My dad was really abusive and he still got 50/50 custody and my mom had to pay him child support and alimony.  Also, why is it a given that men should get custody at all?  It’s weird, it’s like people think children are the property of their father."
1840,"Thank you for the thorough response. I have a couple clarifications and counterpoints I’d like to make. 

Your definition of patriarchy sounds more like an oligarchy to me. By your definition, I’m not sure why gender even matters. 

I completely agree with the Christianity point. However, similarly to the last point: this seems to point to a problem with Christianity and its inherent oppression of women. These are separate conversations. 

Is your sole source of the patriarchy existing the fact that families traditionally use the fathers last name? Mexico and many countries in Central America that are much more oppressive to women adopt a hyphenated surname. 

So you admit that university is dominated by women? Okay then. If you pick and choose degrees then you can make up anything you want. Besides, you want to exclude two of the most respected careers?? Come on, you expect people to sympathize with that? Education and nursing are some of the most respected and secure fields you can go into. Try construction or mining. It’s funny that workplace hours, deaths, and injury are never brought up, who are the ones dominating the shittiest fields? 1969?? Jesus Christ that’s 50 years ago.  The civil rights act was passed in the 60s for gods sake. 

Cocaine is a drug that can be legally manufactured and prescribed by doctors to this day. Of course prison sentences would be less than a completely illegally-manufactured drug. 

The wage gap and custody aren’t even comparable. You can take two parents in identical situations and custody favors the woman. Wage gap disappears in identical fields/experience. Plus there are plenty of men who even pay child support for kids who ARE NOT THEIR OFFSPRING. Tell me that’s not bullshit. 

Healthcare you made my point for me. Women get more/better care and are healthier and live longer. Did you know that prostate cancer kills more men than breast cancer does women? Do you know the funding difference? Breast cancer funding is around 5 times that of prostate (well over a billion per year vs around 250 million for men). How about the homeless population, homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters, etc etc. 

Sure 60 years ago things were different. I still don’t see any facts that point to women being oppressed. On the contrary I can point out dozens of data-backed inequalities for men."
1841,"My favorites are the ones who say there is no wage gap because women 'choose' lower-paying jobs and work fewer hours to take care of the kids, and that is fair.  But if the woman who provided 70% of the child care during the marriage gets 70% of the custody in a divorce, that's totally unfair and proof of a horrible bias against men.   So let me get this right -- equality is when a women works fewer hours to take care of the kids, gets paid less for it, but if there is a divorce, the man gets most of the money and property since he earned more money and half custody at least, even though he didn't provide half the child care?"
1842,">  Also, why is it a given that men should get custody at all?  It’s weird, it’s like people think children are the property of their father.

Both parents should be involved in their children's lives if they want to be involved and are capable of being involved?  Don't perpetuate the myth that women should be the ones caring for children."
1843,">  why is it a given that men should get custody at all? It’s weird, it’s like people think children are the property of their father.

I'm not sure what this means-- can you say a little more about it?"
1844,This is just kinda confirming my theory that most FDS folk (post history is public) are people who've experienced trauma because of toxic masculinity and the patriarchy. FDS is a terrifying symptom of a society that doesn't respect women or their bodies and shifts the blame for the harm they've experienced back onto them.
1845,"I’m a little confused at your point, are you saying that a mom has a greater right to custody than a dad?"
1846,"> Is your sole source of the patriarchy existing the fact that families traditionally use the fathers last name? Mexico and many countries in Central America that are much more oppressive to women adopt a hyphenated surname. 

Nope, that was just one example.

>  If you pick and choose degrees then you can make up anything you want. Besides, you want to exclude two of the most respected careers?? Come on, you expect people to sympathize with that? Education and nursing are some of the most respected and secure fields you can go into. Try construction or mining.  

A few things here.  The reason I brought up education is that education, like construction or mining, did not used to require a 4-year-degree.  Construction and mining still don't require a 4 year degree, but education does.  Since women are most likely to go into education, you will see more women enrolling in college.  And yes, education and nursing are respected, but they aren't necessarily highly paid.  If you see a lot of women in a field that doesn't get the same level pay, then yes, women's wages are lower, and we're talking about money here, not respect or job security. (Also, nothing baring men from going into those fields, and there are programs out there specific to men in those fields.)

Also, more women are applying to college in the first place, and at some colleges, men have a higher acceptance rate; at others, women do.  [At Vassar](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2018-11-02/how-gender-influences-college-admissions), men have an acceptance rate of about 35% compared to 19% for women; [at Columbia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/30/achieving-perfect-gender-balance-on-campus-isnt-that-important-ending-private-colleges-affirmative-action-for-men-is/), men are accepted at an 8% rate rather than the 6% rate for women.  At MIT, acceptance rates for women are higher (they also have fewer women applying).  

Then, if we look at vocational and trade schools, [men out number women](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/04/25/vocational-education-surges-continues-struggle-image-and-gender-imbalance). I certainly don't think the choice to go into a trade is a 'lesser' choice by any means.

Now, I'm more than happy to talk about the issue of men not applying to 4 year universities as much and being more likely to drop out at all levels of education, and what should be done about that.  There absolutely are issues worth discussing there, but I think to frame it as 'women pushing men out of university' does a disservice to the wide variety of reasons boys and men aren't doing as well in education.  Lack of men in early education, public k-12 schools being understaffed, lack of support sources like school counselors, extra-curricular activities being underfunded and cut, a move to test-based education, secondary school vocational training being cut, and the rising cost of post-secondary education are all massive factors.  

> It’s funny that workplace hours, deaths, and injury are never brought up, who are the ones dominating the shittiest fields? 

Workplace safety is an issue near and dear to me -- I work on tech to improve safety in construction, logging, utilities, etc.  It is absolutely terrible that workplace safety isn't given more attention.  While we've made great gains in workplace safety during the 20th and 21st century, there is still so much to be done.  Just because OSHA was passed in 1970 (50 years ago!) doesn't mean the issue is fixed.  I don't know if you are following HR 1309 and HR 1074, two major pieces of workplace safety legislation, but please do so -- write to your representatives, find out how candidates in your area stand on these issues and vote your conscience.  I was a little disappointed to see there wasn't as much outrage from men's advocates with the current administration overturned Executive Order 13543, which did a quite a bit to protect workers in oil, mining and other related industries, and how the new orders do not include any worker protections and in fact make those jobs more dangerous.

Want me to go on about health care and custody issues too?  This is long enough as it is."
1847,I’d say it’s a little harder to measure percentage child care and development than wages earned. But if somehow it could be done I wouldn’t have a problem with it.
1848,"> want to be involved 

Why is it based on what the parent wants and not on what is best for the child?"
1849,Did you not actually look at what I posted on FDS?  It was an absurd shitpost to make fun of that sub and it got me banned.
1850,I mean just look at the way you framed that question. You’re prioritizing the rights of the parent over what’s best for the child.
1851,"No need to hit every topic. I will look into those legislations as you bring up some good points. I think it’s fine to focus on education, seeing as that’s the greatest predictor for socioeconomic status and wealth. I’m not saying/implying that women are pushing men out, that would be stupid. 

My point is this: Since women dominate in university, are more healthy and better cared for, and have better outcomes in legal matters, where is this “patriarchy” that assists men in climbing to the top? Because it’s doing a pretty bad job haha. 

Specifically with education: why would a patriarchy, whose goal is to assist men in becoming higher socioeconomic status in order to rule the general populace, allow women to dominate the best way of achieving that?

Nurses and teachers both have higher wages than the national average, with the potential to easily hit over 100k. They are also respected.  They are pretty great careers, idk why you seem to be down on them. 

There have been plenty of studies that have corrected for career, education, experience, hours worked (you know, all the things that determine a salary) and the “gender wage gap” disappears. I’d suggest looking into them for yourself."
1852,"Want to be involved *and are capable of being involved*, courts absolutely do consider what is best for the child."
1853,How so?
1854,"Well, I would say that women just recently outnumbering men in university no more disproves a patriarchy than family name conventions alone 'prove' a patriarchy.  [Women are still more likely to live in poverty than men in every state in the US, even if you don't include stats on the elderly](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/adult-poverty-rate-by-gender/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D).  This has only been 50 years that women started having the same access to education as men -- 50 years since OSHA hasn't ended worker exploitation, and 50 years of women being in university and  about 25 years where you started to see more women graduate than men. 

And I'm not at all down on nursing or education.  They are great fields, and I am glad there are programs like MenTeach to get more men in those fields.  More men absolutely need to get into teaching and nursing. 

Also, I think you may misunderstand what we are talking about when we discuss the gender wage gap.  Yes, if you were to look at college-educated single people with no children in urban areas, you don't see a wage gap and in some cities, women slightly out-earn men.  The thing is that as people get older and people start having children, you start to see a gendered wage gap grow and grow.  Yes, a lot of that is due to women taking off more time to take care of children.  Now, we could say that's all just personal choice and walk away.  We could also look at the gender custody gap and come to the conclusion that, especially since there is no law saying mothers get more custody, the Tender Years Doctrine was abandoned decades ago, and most custody agreements are reached by the couple outside of the court with no third-party, that's also just personal choice and walk away.

Me, I tend to see them as different sides of the same sexist coin.  While our laws may be better, we still have a lot of social institutions that view women as the default caretakers and less interested in careers, while men are default providers and less interested in families.  Women are often choosing careers based on what will give them the most options to have available time for their families, men are often choosing based on what will give them the most money to provide for a family.  The down side for women is this leaves them more economically vulnerable, the down side for men is that this does mean they don't get as much time with their kids and, in the event of a divorce, it may not make much sense for the children to do a 50/50 custody agreement if he can't provide 50 percent of the physical child care.  And yes, [women are still providing the bulk of the child care](https://www.bls.gov/charts/american-time-use/activity-by-parent.htm). 

A lot of the things that feminists suggest to help with the wage gap -- better family leave policies, a different attitude to flex time, seeing less gender bifurcation in professions, wanting to see greater equality in the unpaid labor done in the home and in raising children -- would also help resolve some of those social expectations that lead to men, in the event of a divorce, getting less custody."
1855,[removed]
1856,"I guess my reply was removed.

But no, the courts frequently fail the vulnerable people (children) they are supposed to protect.  It’s really hard to prove emotional abuse, and if you don’t have any bruises on your actual court date physical abuse is just as hard to prove.  Not to mention, you can be a bad parent even without abusing your kids."

1858,"Have an upvote. Again I appreciate your thorough responses. You’ve brought some new ideas to my thought process and opened my eyes a bit more toward feminism. 

Last question since this has been a bit long winded for both of us: 

Would you agree that it’s entirely possible (in my eyes, most probable) that many of these inequality “issues” aren’t issues at all, but rather the result of personal choice and personality differences. Women and men are not the same, countless studies show this, if you live with a member of the opposite sex then you know this. 

Women and men both bring valuable but different skills to both families and societies."

1861,"Not sold on that one.  Yes, my husband and I are different people, but we’re more alike than my sister and I in many ways (love them both).  

I am not discounting that some things do boil down to personal choice and personality difference.  However, I really am not sold that men just ‘naturally’ are not interested in taking care of children, helping the sick and elderly, or any of the roles traditionally assigned to women.  I have known way too many men who are pretty great with kids, very patient and nurturing, good at creating consensus and getting people to get along to believe men are less capable of those things.  

I am all for letting people bring their unique skills to a family and society and not be expected to be good or bad at something because of their gender.  

And glad I could give you a different perspective on feminists.  We’re not so scary, promise."
1862,"I’m just reiterating what a previous commenter said - the reason men don’t get custody isn’t because the courts are biased against them, it’s because they voluntarily relinquish their custody rights."

1864,"You weren't *reiterating* it. You said, exactly, that most men are uninterested in being involved in their children's lives; that men don't really have any rights to their children; and that when men *do* ask for custody, it's only because they want to ""stick it to their ex-wives.""

Like, this is just so bogus I can't believe you actually said it."
1865,"The person who said this original comment is the reason why so many people hate “feminism”. I applaud you for working to diminish it. It’s unfortunate that feminism attracts many man-haters, as I think the pro-women movement has produced a lot of good throughout US history."

2) Your insinuation that someone's inappropriate behavior is only a problem for them if it gets media attention (and thus it's the media's 'fault') is extremely troubling.

3) All in all, Pewdiepie seems like a fairly run of the mill casual racist and sexist. I don't think he goes out of his way to say and do racist or sexist things, but it's clear that he's never examined his attitudes or behavior for their impact on people who aren't like him."
1869,"> What do you think about Pewdiepie?

Not much. I've never seen an episode, for example. About all I remember offhand when people bring up the name is a non-apology for past racism, followed by continued mildly-racist content. But that was awhile back.

Actually, no. I haven't.

If you'd like to see various more detailed views on pewdiepie, there are several examples of fans coming to ask us our opinion of him. The search function on the right should yield a fair number of results."
1870,"Here's a fabulous video, [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmRYRRDbuw), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqRCSzUTGcM&t=1127s), about the way in which Piewdiepie's style of humor, combined with the YouTube algorithm, can lead to radicalization."
1871,"He was the first youtuber I subscribed to when I was younger. I used to watch his videos religiously, but stopped because his nonchalant jokes about rape bothered me, which was coincidentally around the same time I started researching feminism.

&#x200B;

>Do you think it's his fault or the media outting him in bad light?

I think it's his fault for not adapting his comedy to the political climate that he's in, which he was warned about immensely for years. The media didn't make him scream the N word during a live stream, he did that all on his own.

&#x200B;

>Do you view him as Misogynist?

I wouldn't know how to answer this, in all honesty. That's the tough part about offensive jokes. We have no idea of knowing if his jokes have any semblance to his actual views on women, but the fact he's comfortable enough to say them doesn't put him in a great spot."
1872,"I’m subscribed to his channel and genuinely like his content, but I do have to say some times he makes sexist comments or jokes that as a feminist I tend to disagree and even cringe. That’s really part of life, I can’t expect everyone to think the same way I do and we would go into an argument about whether or not dark humor is appropriate. 

I subscribed after the racism controversy, but before I became an actual fan of him I would sometimes watch stuff that made into the front page and have watched older videos out of curiosity. I believe he actually got better and changed his way of thinking even though he needed a big push to do so. There’s still room for improvement, but all of us can improve and there’s no right way of thinking like a feminist or an anti-racist (although some topics are quite obvious what the consensus of those movements are).

 I’ve noticed that many guys like him have never gone through a type of introspection that most feminists have, but happen to go through another type of one that is more personal and that questions things like consumerism, lifestyle and tries to find an answer on the best way to lead their life.  Not saying the second type is bad, I believe it’s something healthy and I wish I had done more of it, but it’s a lot more self-centered. 

On the other hand the one I’ve noticed most feminists go through questions society’s structure, norms and the consequences of said beliefs not only to them, but to other groups be them marginalized or not. 

To give an example my boyfriend has questioned a lot of the same things he has (based on his philosophy videos), but before we met he had never given much thought about social movements, held a lot misconceptions about them and honestly a mildly sexist point of view. He changed a lot after I exposed him to those movements and answered some of his questions, so have a lot of my male friends after I or other feminists friends talked to them. 

Obviously this is something I’ve observed based on the people in my life so not a formal theory really as far as I know
 
Some of his fans also give him bad rep, but you can’t blame the person because the people who watch them do shitty things, act in cringe ways or are overprotective of the person they’re a fan of. For example I used to be a big a one direction fan, a lot of their fans were batshit crazy and did horrible things (death threats to their girlfriends and anyone that didn’t like the group), but you can’t blame the members for their fans actions and as far as I know most of them are genuinely nice people. 

Sorry if this was a long response, I tried to cover a lot of bases.

Edit: Overall I think he’s a nice guy and I like most of his content, but I think he (and a lot of other people) needs to give more thought and do more research about social movements and sociology, specifically the social study that researches about the role that different type groups of people have had in past and have nowadays and  how it has affected them. To recommend a read or a place to start A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft is a great one."
1873,"He's a cringy bigot who's also unfortunately influential and popular among young boys. It's entirely his fault that he's getting called out for his bullshit. I'm not sure why you bring up media coverage, or rather, the reason you use the term ""in the bad light""? Do you see something good or redeemable in his YT persona? He's made up his bed and has trouble laying in it so I feel no sympathy for him.

I recommend looking up ""Confronting Holocaust Denial with David Baddiel"" in which the authout analyses the way the alt-righters operate and work. I consider Pewdiepie to be an alt-righter and thus can't see why a feminist could support or hold similar views to Pewdiepie."

1891,"From the article you linked:

> “We looked at the performance of Atar and the performance of [grade point average] so a lower Atar did not mean they would get a lower GPA. A higher Atar did not mean they were best in the class,” Agarwal said.

So they’re currently using a measure they know doesn’t predict performance (well or at all, it’s hard to tell from this quote) in order to maintain a certain level of admissions. They’re adjusting said measure to adjust the available applicant pool.

If the score isn’t a strong predictor of performance, the goal of using it is to 1) keep too many people from applying while, most likely, 2) maintaining a sense of exclusivity. If the main goal was to ensure the skill level of applicants, you’d want to use a measure that did so reliably. This sounds like it’s closer to requiring people to be a minimum height. 

Also, if anyone reading has extra time on their hands, I enjoyed learning about what an administrative clusterfuck the Australian [ATAR score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Tertiary_Admission_Rank) in question appears to be. Highlights include state-specific calculation models and a percentile score with an average result of 68.5. 

> She noted a large number of engineering students gained entrance into the undergraduate degree through other pathways, which often were lower than the year 12 Atar minimum score.

So “a large number of” male applicants have long been admitted under different standards as well. But we only need to worry about it if it results in women being admitted. That makes sense."
1892,"If you

A - want to maximize talent in your program

and

B - know there has been historic discrimination against a group, reducing their apparent (but not actual) talent as reflected in admissions criteria

then

C - reducing admissions criteria for that group, but still only taking the top performers within that group

will

D - increase the overall quality of talent at your in your program

oh, and along the way (while your program is being selfish),

E - mitigate the damage done by B"
1893,"Eh, I don't mind.  In my country, there are programs that give men provisional teaching certificates even though they haven't completed the same number of courses for the certificate woman have, in order to help get more men in teaching.  Sometimes we need to modify policies and standards to help make it easier for people to get into a field where they have been under-represented.

Edit to add:  Also, that is at one university, not the country as a whole.  I see no reason why a university can't choose to try out a program.  Also, it sounds like a lot of engineering students are getting in without meeting a minimum score through other pathways, so I don't see why having this particular new pathway at one Australian university would be such a concern."
1894,"I feel the best method would be to not have to say your gender when applying for University. The 'which gender are you' part of university forms (or indeed any application for things like jobs) should be taken out. It is the only way to **ensure** people are judged on merit only, and not gender. That also goes for race."

People do that anyway, regardless of this program or any actual evidence.

I used to go to a common second-choice college in my state. The overwhelming majority of white students I talked to (men and women) that were wearing the sweater of their first-choice college and attending that second-choice college were convinced that they only reason they didn't get into their first-choice college and were thus attending their second-choice college was because of racial admissions preferences.

They believed that racial minorities had been admitted into ""their spot"" and that's why they didn't get into to the first-choice college.

No such racial preferences existed in that school system. Nor had any existed for years (since a court case).

The students still believed it. Because they wanted to."
1901,A lot of men are getting into that program with lower scores than the official minimum.  Are they suspecting their fellow men of only getting in for other reasons?
1902,Acknowledging current and historical discrimination is not insulting or victimizing.
1903,"Biologically speaking, other animals can't practice patriarchy as we understand and define it because it is a creation of human cultural practice and self-organization-- which, at least as far as we know now, is not something that most other animals (mammals included) engage in or practice. There is *some* evidence of cultural behavior/capacity among certain animals-- whales and cetaceans, elephants, chimps, bonobos, and gorillas. 

That said, these animals, even within their families, don't all have the same types of sex interactions/hierarchies as humans-- killer whales, elephants, and bonobos for instance are all matriarchal. There's also no evidence that our understanding of patriarchy is appropriately translated to other animals that 'appear' to be living in male-dominant social arrangements-- because of our tendency to anthropomorphize and project our own values, experiences, and understanding onto other animals we observe."

1913,"No, I got an anthropology minor when I went to Uni."
1914,It means ascribing human behaviors to animals.  It would be impossible to ‘prove’ a patriarchal structure among an animal species without massively and excessively anthropomorphizing them.
1915,Cool!
1916,"That's cool. I'm in psychology, can't say we've read a lot about these issues. Social psychology is probably the closest we can get on our end."
1917,"Oh ok. So that means patriarchal structures can by definition only exist in human societies, am I getting you right?"
1918,"In so far as we know right now, yes.  A patriarchal society would be part of pretty formally organized society with sophisticated forms of communication and we don’t know if animal species have either and if they do what they are.  People may observe animal behavior and impose an intent and structure behind what they are observing, but we really have no reason to do so or any reason to think our assumptions are correct.  We don’t even know to what extent animals even have a concept gender similar to ours."
1919,"I understand.

>We don’t even know to what extent animals even have a concept gender similar to ours.

That's a fair point. We are pretty much used to see the whole thing as sex + gender, but we can't claim to know that the same thing exists in other species. I'll keep that in mind."
1920,"It would depend on the particular group - in some cases yes, in some cases no.  What I do find quite discriminatory is how this behavior in boys can be accepted as ‘boyish’ but if a group of girls are doing it, especially if they aren’t white girls, they invariably get chastised for it.  If it’s healthy and acceptable behavior for boys, why isn’t it healthy and acceptable for girls?"
1921,"Young girls do this too, depending on where you're from. So it's just boisterousness and boldness I guess."
1922,"It depends. At its best, it's a form of play that everyone is okay with. However, it becomes toxic when people are bullied under the excuse that it's ""just a joke"". Or when it is used to exclude girls just because of their gender.

Some people have a higher comfort level with play-aggression, and others have a lower tolerance, regardless of gender, and both tolerance levels are okay. And people of both tolerance levels deserve respect."
1923,"I consider this immature and rude, not sure whether it's toxic masculinity if that's what guys prefer on a daily basis. It might be social or cultural thing. To me it's toxic masculinity but I don't know enough men irl to judge if I'm right or it isn't that deep. 

You may want to read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/ddp0ct/what_ive_learned_from_womens_communities/) thread too."
1924,"Humor is very cultural. The way my friends and family and I use humor is very different from the dominant culture around us. I tried to teach my daughter that the humor she used at home didn't apply for the general public.

I say that because we consider those kinds of playful insults to be a coping mechanism as long as they're funny and delivered with care. As soon as someone is uncomfortable with them, they have to stop or it's not funny anymore. It's part of our culture that I value, greatly.

Playful scuffles help us understand our physical strengths and limits. The other day at work I lifted something and started to hurt. The normal reaction would be to drop it, but if I had, I would have been hurt far worse. Knowing that I could ignore the discomfort allowed me to prevent a serious injury. I learned that in part from all the scuffles with my sister. Our mom sent us outside when we were wrestling or ""fighting"" but she didn't try to make us act like ""good little girls"".

But again, there's a line. Crossing it can result in bullying or abuse."
1925,"There are girls who do this too. The key ingredient here for it to work being consent and knowledge of boundries.

Hell, as a full grown adult I do this with certain friends about certain things. For instance, I play videogames with a group of women. One of the games, I have a tendency to not be aware of my surroundings and often blow myself up. It's funny. I find it funny, my friends find it funny.

They laugh at me when they see me do it, and usually call me an idiot. I also call myself an idiot when I do it, and laugh at myself. I've given them constent to this sort of teasing, and they're mature enough and know me well enough to know the boundries. 

Now, the way for this sort of thing to go wrong is pretty obvious, and the turning point into toxicity is trying to defend your actions even if you screw up and take it too far. Lightly poking at your friends is one thing... ignoring their feelings, ignoring signs of discomfort, so on and so forth.

If you sit there and pick on a subject that you know is sensitive for a friend, if you sit there and get angry when a friend tells you not yo joke about a certain subject, if you refuse to apologize when you've hurt someone's feelings-- intentional or not-- or basically try and blame someone else for reacting to YOUR actions? Yes, that's toxicity.

Using terms like ""it was just a joke, get over it"" or ""dont be a (toxic name here), thats how guys joke""-- absolutely toxic af. 

Social nuances exist. It doesnt work like ""everything or nothing""."
1926,"At a base line, if we are talking about pre-adolecent boys, not automatically. But it can easily become toxic as they age."
1927,"Boys just kinda have more energy

Edit: Very much disagree that it's toxic masculinity, and I can't speak for girls because I never was one. Speaking for the boys here."
1928,Boys aren't encouraged/forced to sit still as much. Girls are. No difference in energy.
1929,"Not sure about this, I thought so too at one point, but every piece I've seen about education for boys talks about how they have more energy and need time to play and do physical activities, whereas girls generally seem to not need this. If it's socialization, why is it true from an early age? Not big on biological essentialism, but I can't choose to ignore what's inherent entirely. If it is socialization, is being encouraged to sit still good for children?"
1930,"Socialization begins at an early age. As soon as toddlers can observe adults & tell the difference between a man & a woman, it begins.

Also, boys suffer from the disadvantage of much less teaching in how to control their emotions. Hence physical releases are more important. Again, socialization."
1931,"Honestly, I think that small physical conflicts and the things OP mentioned are perfectly healthy for young boys. Not sure why it's a disadvantage."
1932,"The OP wasn't saying the rambunctious playing was a disadvantage.

Neither was I.

I was disagreeing with your biological explanation for the difference in rambunctiousness between boys & girls."
1933,"That's fair, I getcha, sorry. I'm prolly wrong about what's biological vs socialized behavior."
1934,"Full disclosure, I haven't actually watched one since I was a kid and my mom made me watch them. I don't exactly remember much of these, so my opinion might not be fully accurate.

I don't particularly like 007 movies, but that actually has little to do with feminism. I just found them incredibly boring when I first saw them.

I think it's totally possible to make a 007 movie without the sexism and racism. Nothing about a spy movie inherently needs to be sexist. Having more than 1 or 2 women in the cast each time, and writing them as an equal to the male characters would help."

This doesn't change it, because Trump is a rapist too, AND worse in other ways (even if not by a longshot, because Biden is also a racist piece of shit tbh).

But unfortunately, barring his resignation, his death, or a freak uptick in votes for Sanders, I don't think I'll live in that world. In which case, when it comes between for which rapist, I'll choose the rapist who will at least ensure a blue Supreme Court, a blue House and Senate, and won't actually try to make it so that he becomes president for life.

I could make a spiel about how tragic it is that it has come to this but I already went through that when a rapist was elected the first time, I'm over it now. Not voting is literally the worst response if you actually intend to change things. Not voting is why we don't have a female president. Not voting is why we have to make such a choice in the first place."

1958,"...so, our choices are a rapist who denies it or a serial rapist who brags about it. Yikes. Somehow none of the female candidates were ""presidential"" enough, though, so obviously that's more important /s.

This is not the first time we've had a rapist president. There were evidence of rape by Thomas Jefferson, JFK, Bill Clinton, and obviously Trump, just off the top of my head. Not to mention the two Supreme Court Justices who were confirmed despite their confirmation hearings filled with evidence that they had sexually harassed/assaulted people. It's disgusting how little it matters whether politicians treat women as people.

I've been pissed for a while that I'm going to be forced to vote for Biden. I'm NOT happy about it. I believe Tara Reade - I have no reason not to. But I'm still going to do it, because a rapist who's very centrist is still a much better option than a rapist whose policies and statements openly pander to Nazis and the most hatefully nationalist, anti-immigrant people in our country.

I'm so sad Elizabeth Warren didn't win the primary! :'-("
1959,Yes. I listened to her story. I am probably not going to vote for him. I was going to vote for him until I heard about it.
1960,"As a die hard third party voter I would have voted for Tulsi, Bernie, or Warren. Instead I’ll be sticking with whoever the libertarians throw on the ballot. The two party system has to go."
1961,I’m all for giving him the benefit of doubt but given his history of being weirdly touchy to women it doesn’t seem surprising. I was already for Bernie anyway as I think Biden is living in a fantasy land where all of America’s problems will be solved if they just get rid of the evil orange man so this isn’t changing anything.
1962,"This is something I'm really struggling with. I vote for Bernie in this primary and the last one. 

I think the DNC screwed him out of a nomination in 2016, and pulled a bunch of weight in getting others to drop out so their member Biden would get the nomination. 

In 2016, I voted 3rd party because I couldn't allow myself to vote for someone e who sexually assaults women or someone who covers up her husband's assaults. 

I am conflicted this year because Trump is worse than I could have even imagined. I live in a state that always votes Democratic. I'm torn between my conflicting values. I think if I was somewhere that was not historically democratic I would vote for Biden. Part of me feels like my vote doesnt matter so it doesnt matter if I vote 3rd party again, and part of me feels uneasy not working for getting trump out of office. 

So basically. Idk wtf I'm going to do. Lol."
1963,"I guess if I have the choice of two pussy grabbers to vote for, I’ll vote for the one that isn’t Trump. Biden was definitely not my first choice!"
1964,The fact that some of the same people who screamed at the top of their lungs about Bernie Sanders being sexist during the primaries are now trying to sweep this under the rug is an example that there are people out there who don't actually care about sexual harassment or abuse unless they can use it as a political hammer to beat their opponents with. It's pretty discouraging...
1965,This is why Bernie seems like the clear choice to me. I'm still sad he's so far behind
1966,Biden is objectively [handsy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Co8FlIVWgAAGx2n.jpg:large).
1967,"I was never going to vote for creepy Joe. Nobody I know voted for creepy Joe, yet somehow he won the primary. It doesn't really matter, apparently, if we vote for him or not. He will win because the billionaires want him to win."
1968,[removed]
1969,Of course! I always take a candidates character into consideration. Not tryna have a dystopia
1970,"I expected this given all the shit of him smelling women, hugging and even kissing them. I do think at the very least he's definately behaved inappropriately towards women. Its not a good look and its real disrespectful to his wife as well. i dont like Biden. Ive said it before for more reasons than this, he's very I think all around Bernie is a better choice."
1971,"I'm extremely disappointed in the democratic party for going all-in on Biden. I was really hoping for Warren or Sanders to pull through.

But at the end of the day, in November I have two choices. A man who has been accused by one woman, or the guy who has been accused by 25+ women and brags about it."
1972,I wasn't going to vote for a pro-life candidate in the first place so...
1973,"I don't want to support a rapist but I also don't want to essentially hand the country over to Russia (Russia's admitted propping up Sanders, probably because Trump would wipe the floor with him) 

Dunno. Guess I'll just write someone in."
1974,"It’s a tough situation ... obviously Biden is not the most ideal candidate, for a few reasons, and now this. I’m curious, why is it just coming out now before the election? Unfortunately, even as a feminist, I can’t just blindly believe every claim that’s thrown out there. I’d like to read up more on the story before I can decide where I stand, but to me the timing alone is suspicious (literally right before an election). 

Still, I hate to say it, but I will vote for ANYBODY but Trump. I mean literally anybody.

Edit: Based on all the atrocious and manipulative lengths Trump went to in order to win the last election (ie. billions spent on Cambridge Analyitica to basically brainwash people) it wouldn’t surprise me if this was just another desperate attempt of the Trump Campaign to villainize his opponent. Dude, he got impeached because he tried to get a foreign nation to find dirt on Biden before. Remember how he villainized Hillary?"
1975,"He has been violating consent on camera for years and I will not vote for him.

1977,[removed]
1978,Agreed. I think Anita Hill's experience with Biden is important context as well.
1979,"This makes me incredibly sad. What in the fuck is wrong with America when our only viable choices for president are predatory men? One openly harasses and gets a pass from his followers. The other creeps and stalks and then tries to sweep it under the rug. 

I’m a man and I know that in my life I have acted inappropriately towards women. I feel really ashamed of it and try not to be like that. But Jesus. They continue to act like this as old men and don’t change. This makes me very angry."
1980,">Seems the only hope to put a non-rapist in the White House is a Sanders surge in the upcoming states.

There is some speculation that Joe Biden might resign from the campaign after receiving the nomination and be replaced with some other democrat such as Andrew Cuomo.  I don't know enough about Cuomo to say whether or not he would be a good President.

As a Sanders supporter myself, I would much rather see a Sanders surge propel him to the nomination and then to the White House.

BTW, Sanders gave this talk yesterday in support of poor people receiving relief checks for coronavirus: https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/fp2w59/bernie_is_killing_it_on_the_senate_floor_right/

If you know anyone (like me) who was raised by conservatives, I think it goes a long way to show the flaws in that point of view.

Biden is not fit to be President for the reasons we've discussed."
1981,Seems like if Biden was asked to step down candidates who suspended their campaign might choose to resume.
1982,What would you way to all the people on the Biden sub who say that she's lying?
1983,[deleted]
1984,Choose your POTUS: 25 allegations or 7 allegations
1985,"I normally hate the ""vote blue no matter who"" notion because it gives the DNC the ability to push Wall Street aligned corporatists on us and tell us that we have to vote for them because the alternative is the Republicans.

However, at this point, looking at the COVID-19 situation, we have a POTUS who is making decisions that will result in the preventable deaths of thousands or even millions of people in this country.

The Lt Governor of Texas let the mask slip momentarily and literally said that he wants America's most vulnerable people to voluntarily sacrifice their health and their lives on the alter of the stock market.  Fuck him!

Donald Trump is doing much the same, chomping at the bit to ""re-open"" the country at any cost.

Trump tells us he knows how to compete.  Mark my words!  China has stopped their flow of new COVID-19 cases to a trickle.  If China manages to contain COVID-19 and the USA has a pandemic of Spanish Flu proportions because of the ineptitude of people like Trump and the TX Lt Governor, we can look forward to decades of the Chinese looking down their collective nose at us and telling us that representative democracy doesn't work and that their brand of authoritarianism is the way of the future, and if that happens, who is to say that the Chinese would be wrong?  Sure, they jail and torture political dissidents and deny their people freedom of religion and speech and keep their people under the thumbs of predatory capitalism (while labeling themselves ""communists""), but they seem to know something about how to stop a pandemic.

::barf::"
1986,I’d be interested to know how many people would still vote blue no matter who for a dem accused of sexual assault versus a rep who hadn’t been
1987,"As a survivor of abusive relationships, the ""I'll take anyone who is marginally better than my last rapist/abuser/abusive relationship"" attitude is not one I'm thrilled to see anyone embracing politically.  In my opinion, we need to have high standards for people, in all areas of life, but especially the political process. This includes both candidates and organizations like the DNC. In my opinion, it's morally cheating ourselves to ""vote blue no matter who"". It's saying that one rapist is slightly better than another one. In my opinion, we have a feminist candidate. Bernie Sanders has fought for women's rights for time out of mind. It's time to stand up for him."
1988,"This. 

If the dems move forward with Biden as the candidate, we don't have to personally like him, but any democratic choice is better than Trump and I would challenge any bernie or buster on this point to my dying breath. 

It isn't very intersectional of you to not vote on principles when your vote could have helped many americans who need it now, think about all the children locked up in ICE cages, what would you tell them if you didn't vote to help them?

""sorry, your freedom can wait, the person who could have helped you wasn't progressive enough for me personally, it's a shame that inconviniences you"""
1989,I agree with this 100%.
1990,[removed]
1991,"Can you vote against one, though? Because Trump is loosening Title IX guidelines that protect rape victims and generally supports policies that protect predators.

Voting is not about how much you like someone or whether you approve of them or whether you would testify against them in a trial. It’s about making pragmatic choices for our whole community."
1992,"I don’t give a shit who’s side they’re on. The minute I find out that someone has traumatized multiple women the way I was traumatized, I’ll wipe my ass with their ballot. If someone continues to vote for joe Biden even using “trump is a rapist” spiel, then they can shut it. Just because joe is a democrat doesn’t excuse him from being a predator and the same for trump. 

If it comes down to having to choose between the two of them, I refuse to. I don’t care who ends up in office, We are screwed anyways. It sucks because trump can take away mine and other women’s reproductive rights, but how can i vote for someone knowing the trauma assault causes?"
1993,But what if you can vote out the biggest sexual predator of them all?
1994,Our only hope is Bernie.
1995,"I am a feminist and I am horrified that these are the people running for office. But I know that people voting for Trump are not going to abstain from voting, and so I need to vote for the much lesser evil, even though it sickens me."
1996,"By not voting for Biden, you are voting for a worse sexual predator— Trump. Non-voters got Trump to the White House in 2016. [This is well-documented.](https://fortune.com/2018/08/09/nonvoters-trump-presidency-pew-study/) Choose wisely, friend."
1997,What would you say to all the people on the Biden sub who say that she's lying?
1998,"Honestly, Vermin Supreme seems like the best candidate now. I've lost faith in Bernie, I want him to be president, but the most liberals don't like him and are unlikely to vote for him."
1999,The primary's not over yet
2000,"Fully agree. When it comes to voting for the future and voting for a person who will enact policies that protect our reproductive healthcare, Trump could run again as a Democrat and I would vote for him (assuming that in this imaginary world, he was legit 100% committed to supporting women’s healthcare and ALL the choices that come with it). It is my absolute number one voting issue. Plus, reform is important when it comes to sexual harassment. Biden has fucked up A LOT, but there are good things he’s done that I won’t forget about, including the It’s On Us sexual harassment campaign he headed while he was in the White House. 


I should add a disclaimer that [the New Yorker article about Al Franken](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/the-case-of-al-franken) influences my attitude toward Biden. Even if none of the facts are exactly the same... it’s a vibe.


ETA: I would like to see something, anything about who Reade told about this encounter btw. Having volunteered at a sexual assault crisis center, I’m aware that there are a few things that help validate a story of harassment or assault. I am not saying I don’t believe her, however it’s something I look for whenever I hear any story of sexual trauma. It can be a journal, an email, fully anecdotal, whatever— but I’d like to see a link of this in the past somewhere."
2001,"But why do you think Biden will be better? He is a liberal. Liberals have never been our ally in the fight for women's reproductive rights. And Biden is particularly bad for a liberal as he has explicitly stated he doesn't support Roe and has routinely empowered the worst conservatives had to offer. He has publicly stated he wants a GOP VP.

Vote for Biden if you must but it isn't going to help. We need to be ready to fight this in the streets. It is the only chance we have at saving reproductive rights."
2002,The primary isn’t over.
2003,"I won't be voting for Biden in the general election, but I will be voting for my senators and local Representatives. If we're going to have an old Catholic rapist president, he's going to have to win by appealing to moderate Republicans and not forcing progressives to vote for him by holding Trump to their heads like a gun."
2004,"Voting shouldn't be about preference. Because if it is then you allow unaccountable party and corporate forces to push the window of normalcy far away from anything you support.

You should vote only for people whose politics you support. Otherwise you are going to end 2020 with *Deliberately voted for a rapist* permanently inscribed on your soul and you will have gained nothing for it. Your country and your party will have moved even further to the right and further away from any of your feminist ideals."
2005,"I don’t love Pete but I like him much more than Biden. Obviously warren too. If either of them replace him that’s a soft win, even though Bernie has been my top choice since he announced candidacy"
2006,Seriously. Whichever party is first to adopt [some better voting method](https://www.electionscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/comparing_voting_methods_simplicity_group_satisfaction-1.png) in the primary has an advantage in the generals. It's absurd that it hasn't happened yet.
2007,Wait... are you saying Bernie Sanders is out?!
2008,I don't intentionally do evil things. So I can't vote for either. I don't understand why so many people seem to want to be evil.
2009,"> I’m amazed he’s going to be our nominee

Its because they know you will vote blue no matter who. Why bother giving you a candidate you like when you are going to vote for their guy anyway?

Might as well put up a corporatist that their donors like."
2010,"Plane logs?  I haven’t heard anything about this.  Perhaps I’ve been under a rock or this has been buried by people who are concerned with such things but I had no idea Biden even had any connection to Epstein.  Clinton, yes.  But not Biden."
2011,"I am a feminist and I am horrified that these are the people running for office. But I know that people voting for Trump are not going to abstain from voting, and so I need to vote for the much lesser evil, even though it sickens me."
2012,"Can I ask, and I don't mean to be combatative, but do you not think that not voting for biden due to personal morals is reflective of the affordance of privelige you have?

When I see someone say they won't vote for the chosen dem candidate who is more progressive than trump. Which biden is, unequivocally, based on his policy positions VS trump. I can't help but call into question how much you actually care about intersectional issues that effect PoC and children locked up in ice camps. I don't doubt you say you care, but without actually using your vote to back up those words, you aren't effectivly pushing for positive change, you are reinfocing the status quo.

Even if that is not your intention, and even if the ""ivory tower"" we both stand on isn't even a tower, its just basic human decency, the effect of your inaction shows, to the people whp really need your help right now, that you don't care.

And any defence based around your personal moral reasons for not voting blue, will only ring off as an insanely priveliged, none intersectional position to those people who need that help."
2013,Vermin Supreme 2020
2014,"Congrats, you’re effectively throwing away your vote."
2015,"Vote third party unless the Democratic party makes serious concessions to the left. If they think they can nominate someone as loathsome as Joe Biden and we'll still go along with it, the last thing we want to do is prove them right."

2021,I honestly was shocked how many Democrats completely ignored what happened with Anita Hill. After the metoo movement and such I thought this kinda thing would be important. Yet many clearly do not care.
2022,Not the only choices! Primary for Sanders!
2023,"> There is some speculation that Joe Biden might resign from the campaign after receiving the nomination and be replaced with some other democrat such as Andrew Cuomo. I don't know enough about Cuomo to say whether or not he would be a good President.

I am a Sanders supporter but at this point would be fine with a non sanders or biden nomination, though I feel like it has to be decided at the convention and if they pull the switcheroo after then there will be revolts and a loss for sure."
2024,">resign from the campaign after receiving the nomination and be replaced

Wait this is actually how it works? Can he choose whoever he wants? And we get no say in it?"
2025,"> There is some speculation that Joe Biden might resign from the campaign after receiving the nomination

I don't find it likely but there have been a lot of elections where someone runs unopposed.  there's a list here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Uncontested_elections

in the U.S. you usually hear this about a mayor, governor, etc.  I'm always surprised, but it happens."
2026,I’d be shocked if the Biden camp responds at all to this.
2027,Yeab but Biden already promised them cabinet positions lmao they'll never let him step down
2028,"I honestly don't know what there is to say to them. If you're already at the point where you're an active participant in the Joe Biden subreddit, odds are you're primed to reject anything negative about him no matter how much it goes against your stated principles to do so. Every campaign has its dead enders.

The people I hope are swayed by this are those who only recently switched their support to Biden. People who might still be asking themselves if he's really the best candidate to nominate in the general."
2029,"Yes. Exactly like Trump. Gosh, how did we end up with a Democrat who's exactly like Trump? Was there any way to avoid this?"

[We really need to fix our voting system](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/aaron-hamlin-voting-reform/). It could save democracy."
2032,"I mean at least with Biden being a DNC calculated candidate they're likely to do the math and give us a progressive VP and in the words of my best friend's partner when Trump won, ""based on actuarial tables, maybe we won't have to deal with four years of him""

If that's how we have to get President Elizabeth Warren or President Stacey Abrams it still gets there."
2033,"China has a democracy. It may be a flawed democracy but it is a democracy. And it is a democracy that is generally more democratic than the US' because the CCP allows people to participate in internal party politics and neither American party does.

And come on, we jail political dissidents too. The US has the biggest prisons in the world. Most of those prisoners are there for purely political reasons."
2034,"Depends on the particular candidates.  If it was a republican who never committed any assault and was good on things like funding planned Parenthood, hadn’t supported the Hyde amendment, wasn’t toying with definitions in VAWA, was pro-Medicare for all, etc. then maybe.  

Personal behavior is absolutely important, but so is public policy when I select who to vote for.  I won’t vote for someone with policies I object to just because he is personally a good guy."
2035,"If it were between a Republican who seemed to be a decent, moral individual and a Democrat who had a credible sexual assault claim against them, I'm pretty sure I'd vote for the Republican. I don't have any loyalty whatsoever to the Democratic party, and the only reason I'm voting blue in November is because they're the only ones we can reasonably expect to unseat Trump (unless Sanders resurges, because I actually like him). There are some positions the Republican could take that'd lose him my vote, though.

On the other hand, a proper apology and demonstration of reformed behavior can go a long way."
2036,"Same. I think I still would, because ultimately Biden's politics *are* better than Trump's. Ultimately, while the idea of empowering a rapist when another choice exists sickens me, it would probably still be better for the country (and the world) to vote blue. At least biden wouldn't be trying to provoke world leaders to war, revoke abortion rights, revoke marriage equality, destroy medicare/medicaid, build the border wall, put a conservative judge in Ruth Bader Ginsberg's seat when she dies or retires.. Just to name a few off the top of my head. 

There is something to be said for teaching people that rapists cannot get elected (and for showing rape victims the respect of not electing a rapist, and dont get me wrong, as a survivor myself, that's important to me too).. But i feel like elections are a *terrible* time for protest. Letting all that other shit happen just to make a point doesn't really seem justified to me.

So ultimately, for me, I'd still be on #VoteBlueNoMatterWho even if Trump weren't a rapist too, but I'd be less judgmental of those who aren't. I don't think I could blame any survivor who couldn't stomach casting that vote. As it stands, I can only blame them a little, and only because staying home or voting third party, in the case of this election, is effectively a vote for trump, so pretty much, no matter what, if biden is the nominee, every adult american citizen will be voting for a rapist this November. Unfortunately we have to stomach voting for the slightly less dangerous rapist. Which is really an incredibly pathetic state our nation is in to reach that point."
2037,"
I'd wager most feminista did vote for a rep who hadn't been accused of shit. In the primary. But if Biden becomes the candidate, I doubt most who care about the Paris Climate accords, abuse of immigrant children, religious discrimination in immigration, protections for trans folk, healthcare, reproductive rights, social security (which Trump has mentioned targeting in a second term), scientists, nepotism and corruption, rising authoritarianism or even just having someone stable at the helm, will vote Biden.

Voting in generals in a two party system isn't necessarily about voting for someone you love, but it's about voting for the best opponent. While Biden ( and lbr Bernie too) are the least inspiring, most flawed, and ""safest"" options of what was a much more remarkable, accomplished, and inspired primary field, either would be more likely to listen to progressive politicians, activists and academics than Donald Trump.  At this point, Charles Manson running as a democrat would be a better bet for this nation and more likely to work with progressives and make rational political decisions than Donald Trump. 

Considering rampant voter suppression, disinformation campaigns poisoning the well and encouraging progressive voter non-participation, gerrymandering, and an electoral college that weighs votes from some sparsely populated states as much as 3.5 times those in larger blue ones, every blue vote matters to topple an incumbent president and realistically, we might still not. European election betting sites still favored Trump (though I haven't checked since this coronavirus/recession shit).

So yeah. I'd vote Biden. No exceptions. Because I know we can't handle four more years of Trump transparently trying to kill us all,  particularly the most vulnerable among us. We can't survive four more years of Stephen Miller formulating immigration strategy or the spectre of Ted Cruz or someone worse replacing RBG on the Court. If we don't take back the Senate, we can't not have someone who can veto McConnell's unhinged bullshit (and the only chance we have to do that is by drawing in blue votes upticket)

But also, let's be real. It's not like Donald Trump hasn't been accused of the same as Biden except more rampantly, worse, and with younger women. So even so far as sexual harassers in chief, zero would be best, but if we can't have zero, Biden's still a pretty marked upgrade."
2038,"In the primaries, yes, I agree. That's why I voted for him. In the general, its a waste, and dangerous. That's what his supporters did in 2016 when Hillary became the nominee, and it handed trump the election. They proved that if the small handful of faithful dem voters who voted third party or stayed home had voted for Hillary, she'd have won. And we'd still have an absolute demon in the white house, but at least we wouldn't be worrying about repro rights, marriage equality, trans military rights, the border wall, WWIII threats, we would have a progressive SCOTUS judge instead of Kavenaugh (and therefore a progressive majority!), we wouldn't have seen that major surge in fascist violence after the election, etc. 

The same is true this time. Biden might be absolute trash, but he's less dangerous than Trump. And as a survivor too, i get where youre coming from. It sickens me that we're looking at ""very fascist rapist or extraordinarily fascist rapist"" here. There's just simply too much on the line here. Especially since there's a good chance the 2024 pres will be replacing Ruth Bader Ginsberg. She's very old, been there forever, and had cancer twice in the very recent past. She's still going strong, but at her age, she could take a hard turn for the worse any day. Republicans already have a 5-4 majority. If Trump gets to replace her, it'll be 6-3, which is incredibly dangerous. And SCOTUS is a lifetime appointment. If Trump gets to replace her, we can likely kiss repro rights goodbye nationwide.

There's simply too much at stake in this election to use it to make a point and stick it to the man. We have another 4 years to change things and line up a decent candidate for next time. If we overturn Roe V. Wade, it could be decades before we can fix it."
2039,I just want to know who's going to pay for all the free stuff
2040,"I mean when you strip the argument of all nuance it sure is easy to be mad at. I'm going to make my case here but I want you to go in with the context that I'm not boiling *you* down to essentially this viewpoint, I'm just very angry that it exists. I'm sure you're a fine human.


That being said, I can't more wholeheartedly believe that it's not better to live in a society that still does the same fucked up shit but sweeps it under the rug and pretends to be woke. Neoliberalism is a cancer and is moving our nation further and further right which facilitates things like a Trump president or a McConnell permanent blockade or the absolute disgrace of putting this [fuck](https://twitter.com/kashanacauley/status/1045422828714160129/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1045422828714160129&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com%2F90243625%2Fkavanaugh-rage-meme) on the supreme court . People are evidently stupid as fuck atm and it appears that they need things to be obvious with politics. Everyone congratulated themselves when we got Obama in office, which was undoubtedly a symbolic victory of great import -but- during his tenure we also got citizens united, relentless drone striking campaigns, the bank bailouts (ever notice how many buildings are now chase banks?) to name a few. But don't say that right now on the internet because everyone's assholes will clench to try to combat the essentialist stance on every issue we can't seem to fucking kick. How will we cheer our team if we have to actually check which players are criminals or coaches are sexually assaulting people or where the fuck are any women in this football analogy?


Certainly Trump is far more openly problematic but he's also stimulating some amount of fucking *response* on the left which has been historically difficult. With his absolutely infantile response to this virus he's stripped people of their final leg to stand on which is always how real actual change begins. We cannot lose this momentum to Joe fucking Biden, a man who is definitely showing signs of dementia and wholeheartedly promises a return to the status quo. He will absolutely lose to Trump. Try to imagine that debate. Two senile fucks making noises at each other on stage. All Trump has to do is repeat whatever Joe scrapes together as a response in a funny voice. We are crumbling as a nation. We literally can't survive another Trump presidency if the virus acts like the spanish flu and returns stronger than before. The DNC is banking on Blue Not Matter Who to prop Biden up as a contender. We are literally participating in a statement that says ""nah whoever is ok"". The fuck kind of horseshit is that?!


I will definitely not ever join this blue no matter who has dementia campaign and I wholeheartedly reject the idea that this gives you, with all due respect, the platform to actually tell me that it's my fault if trump wins rather than the DNCs fault for creating such a monumental disaster. There is no nuance to it, it's just ""our team"" vs ""the other team"". By endorsing Biden you're allowing the DNC to hand us the candidate that they select to conform to their business needs like a good little voter subscribing for more speeches on equality and dirty politics as usual.


Imagine Sanders ripping Trump a new pussy to grab on the debate stage. Imagine this hot in the heels of a pandemic in which millions of people are dying, in which millions are out of a job and you have one dumbass asking you to die for the economy and one man saying, ""you deserve better"".


Get angry. Riot. Do *something*. Don't roll over for the party. Don't compromise what we believe in for what they are pedaling as the winner. We deserve better."
2041,"That isn't what intersectional means. If you were *actually* intersectional in your analysis you'd understand why we can't vote for Biden. Biden helped lock up those children in those concentration camps. Biden wrote a crime bill that if you know anything about intersectionality you'd know targeted black people. Biden has raped women.

What freedom is he offering anyone?"
2042,"You managed to use a morally bankrupt and logically fallacious argument that is a tried and true staple of pretty much every conservative everywhere, throughout history, in an attempt to convince others that voting for a status quo promoting alleged rapist is the morally correct thing to do.

Brava, I have to bow in front of your asininity.

""Think of the children,"" has been the rallying call against everything from rock 'n roll to gay rights to abortion, and you just attempted to use it to convince others that voting for a giant douche is better than voting for a turd sandwich.

Honestly, you should be doing your level best to encourage others to not give in to the artificial divide between the two main parties that protect the interests of those who are rich and well-connected.

Promoting the status quo is over, and anyone who supports those who are for the status quo needs to either get on board or sit down, shut up, and stay home on election day because we're headed for ruin, and electing Biden over Trump won't change that one little bit."
2043,Out.
2044,"Report and block, everyone. Using misogynistic slurs is certainly against subreddit rules right?"
2045,How come your pragmatism is just voting for rapists?
2046,"Trump is doing so much more than trying (and succeeding) to take reproductive rights. He is poisoning the air, the water and the earth. 50 years of clean air and water and he is destroying it. He loosened Title IX guidelines protecting rape victims. He doesn’t support the Violence Against Women Act or anything else that isn’t might makes right. 

Biden isn’t a good man and he doesn’t deserve to be President. But we will be so much better off with him as President than a mob boss. He also won’t pick someone who thinks The Handmaid’s Tale is a to-do manual as his VP.

Let’s hope Sanders wins the nomination somehow. They’re fuckheads all the way down, but by god, do not let them chase you out of your strongest position of power in this country. You have the right and the responsibility to vote, and it’s not fucking fair that we might have to choose (yet again) between two chauvinist rapists. But we still have to show up.

Maybe they’ll both get coronavirus..."
2047,This is so sad. What we’ve come to is “which sexual predator is a little less bad than the other?”.
2048,One sexual predator does not make another sexual predator seem any better

2060,"I don't think people want to be evil, I think they want to get rid of the current assholes in the White House. Not voting as a moral stance just pretty much guarantees four more years of the current guy, who's pretty much demonstrated that he's completely unqualified for this job. You're not voting as a marriage proposal. You're voting as a way to attempt to move your country forward. Or at least ""not backward."""
2061,"I think being in a position where President Biden would be a step up for you is a reflection of privilege. Biden won't close the camps on the border. Biden won't stop the drone bombing and the endless coups. Biden won't give us healthcare. Biden won't give us housing. Biden won't give us a living wage.

There are people in this country and abroad for whom nothing changed when Trump became president and nothing will change if Biden becomes president. Their lives have always been awful. They don't vote because they know from experience the political process has nothing for them.

You should really rethink your image of the typical nonvoter. It's not college kids who would only vote for a marxist-leninist or whatever. It's people will deep and long standing reasons to believe they have no stake in our democracy.

I've been phone banking for Sanders a lot this year. An all too common response I hear goes like, ""Obama promised all those things too and he lied. That's why I don't vote."" (or, even more depressingly, ""That's why I'm voting for Trump."")

The failure of the Democratic Party to actually fight for poor and marginalized people in this country has poisoned the well for anyone attempting to do so now. People don't believe you when you say you'll fight for them, no matter who you are. They've been burned too many times.

And if these people can't be convinced that Bernie is genuine, do you think they'll ever believe a thing Biden says?"
2062,I have considered that question a lot. It is a morally fraught decision. At the end of the day I can't bring myself to vote for someone who sexually assaulted a woman. It is viscerally repugnant to me.
2063,There are certain lines in the sand that we must draw. I wouldn't ever vote for a murderer. Ever. And I won't ever vote for a sexual predator. Ever.
2064,"It is the opposite. Look at the demographics of who nonvoters are. It is VERY clear that the privileged who vote. Those most dispossessed don't or can't.
If you actually care about PoC then find out why most of them don't vote. If you actually care about immigrants find out why most of them don't vote.

I know you won't do either of these things though. You are a liberal. Liberals created those concentration camps. Liberals filled our prisons to bursting with PoC. Liberals destroyed our environment. We don't vote for you because we actually stand for the things you pretend to."
2065,You are voting for a rapist. That is much worse than throwing away your vote. That is deliberately supporting evil because you don't care about other people.

2071,"They don't need to do a primary at all. The Democratic party is a completely private organization and we are not members of it. They can do whatever they want. They only permit a primary to give an illusion of participation.

They have gone against the will of their voters before."
2072,"I'm a Biden supporter and I've found their response to the allegations quite appalling. Even women are accusing her of being a Russian agent based on a few articles she wrote singing high praises of Putin. There's no report of her allegations in the mainstream media, which I believe is because of either not enough evidence, or they don't like Sanders. Sure the timing is suspicious, but I think she deserves a chance to be heard."
2073,"Just depends if the accusations are credible or not.  

There was a little while there where someone was accusing Buttigieg of rape and that turned out to be false."
2074,It’s kind of like how we keep picking candidates that are over 70 and barely can form coherent sentences (although I really do like Bernie a lot). Why do we do this to ourselves America?
2075,"Not really. Unfortunately, this kind of violence against women is encouraged ideologically by both liberalism and conservatism. The way that you avoid this is by having better politics."
2076,Will more people write in Bernie than vote for Trump? If not then a write in for Bernie is a vote for Trump (hate to repeat this talking point but it’s not false). Will the long term benefits of the Democratic Party realizing that they need the support of progressives be worth 4 more years or Trump? Will more good be done by sending that message than harm that is the Trump presidency?
2077,"> If it was a republican who never committed any assault and was good on things like funding planned Parenthood, hadn’t supported the Hyde amendment, wasn’t toying with definitions in VAWA, was pro-Medicare for all, etc. then maybe.

That sure doesn’t sound like any republican I know"

2080,"I don't understand. When have liberals *ever* listened to progressives? The idea that Biden might is a fantasy. Bill never did. Obama never did.

Liberals and progressive are on complete opposite sides of the political spectrum. Everything progressive have won they did despite the efforts of liberals.

Do you know why I can't vote for Biden? If this new accusation turns out to be highly credible and I voted for Biden and he ended up president I would not be able to live with myself. I'd feel like that vote was a black mark on my soul."
2081,"No no no, that isn't how elections work. Bernie supporters didn't hand Trump the election by failing to vote. 75% of this nation refused to vote for Hillary. They did so for valid reasons. 

Also what? Hillary was absolutely terrible on queer rights, geopolitics, and immigration. She is a liberal. Liberals are way too far to the right to be good on any of this. She would not have elected a progressive judge because she was not a progressive. Progressives are her only real enemy."
2082,What free stuff?
2083,"We do deserve better. But the way to get there is not by allowing all of the shit that has gone on for the last 4 years continue to go on, and actually likely get worse. I feel like that should be obvious. But apparently it’s not. People, like you, care more about being angry than actually preventing things from getting worse.

Has Trump’s policies finally evoked a loud opposition from the left? Yes. But they haven’t actually been able to do anything to stop his policies because of how our stupid government is setup. You need to beat the current system at its own game before you can implement a new system.

Too many people are too angry that the status quo has remained for so long that they’re willing to make everything worse for the next however many years rather than just keep the status quo and let it naturally die out. Eventually all of the people who want to keep the status quo will die and more and more people with progressive ideas will be elected.

I’d rather keep the liberal status quo for the next 50 years and then get a more progressive movement for the next 200 than allow the next 50 years to be ruled by people like Trump because the left wants to “stick it to the status quo”."
2084,"Literally in his policies, you should read them. I would strongly agree his track record is bad, but if you look at what he wants to do, the policies are unequivocally better for us and the people that need it than,what ttunp is currently doing. THAT is where the intersectionality comes in. Its basic logic: bidens policies are more progressive than trumps, biden is going to be the dem nominee, biden should get our vote as progressives. We might not like biden but I strongly argue it's in our best interest and the interest of the people who trump won't help that biden will to vote for him."
2085,"""Morally bankrupt""? I'm a conesquentialist, its against my better nature to nit consider the consequences of people not voting for the dem candidate, the people locked up at the border is absoloutly one of them. It's also an effective way of making people realise how much of a privileged dick they're being in denying those freedoms by not voting due to being defeatist morally superior people.

You managed to swerve back to the defeatist end times larping i see so many bernie or busters do.

Its part of your guys modus operandi though, to muddy the waters between party lines and lie about just how simmilar trump and biden are when if you look at their policies, they're actually pretty different.

Ofc i know you havent actually looked at bidens policies and trumps policies.

Ofc they both support coroprate interests, we live in a capitalist society, fighting that is one of the reasons bernie keeps losing and I agree with bernie. The only way thats gonna change is if you get all your little buddies together, grab your AR 15's and start the violent revolution you dream about in your sleep every night."
2086,"Because in this case, it seems that only rapists have a chance of making it to the Presidency (again). I already voted for Sanders in the primary. I have never loved Biden or wanted to vote for him. But goddamn if I’m not going to help choose what policies shape my country."
2087,"The democrats are not better on this. You will still be living in a sulfuric wasteland in 30 years regardless of who you vote for because both are terrible on the environment. Under both presidencies we will still have concentration camps at the border. Under both presidencies we will still have the largest and blackest prison population in the world. Under both presidencies we will have a conservative SC likely for the rest of our lives.

The democrats are in the weakest position in the history of the party. Their neoliberalism has lost them 2000 state and local seats. Now they want us to vote for a rapist who is to the right of Reagan. VBNMW is not working out for us."

2089,"The choice becomes easier when one is less likely to continue fucking (literally and metaphorically) not only other women but every other person in this country and beyond.

I support any woman who comes forward with a claim of trauma. I have empathy toward all survivors, and the ones that come out are nothing short of courageous. Being assaulted is humiliating. Revealing it to the public can be even more humiliating (wrongfully so). I guess I can settle on a “middle ground” of: I support Tara Reade. Her experience sounds awful. I also feel compelled to vote for Biden in 2020. Trump has to get out of office. Something that deeply sickens me is the thought of Trump leaving office during his first term (for whatever reason), leaving none other than Mike Pence in charge. I fear that while Pence is more competent than Trump, he would be 100x worse for women’s healthcare. I’m voting against Trump AND Pence in 2020 by voting for Joe Biden."
2093,"No its not. 

This is a narrative the establishment is pushing - that you have to choose one evil over another or the wrong evil could win. This is how they stay in power. Fuck that. Don’t play the game where you pick your favorite rapist. Get involved in local politics and make down ballot chooses you feel good about. Change the body politic. Vote for representatives who will dismantle the first past the post system to allow for multiple political parties across the spectrum rather than two “centrist” monoliths. That will have way more impact than your one vote for the Oval Office"
2094,National polls are shifting in favor of Sanders. 538 has been wrong before.
2095,What do you mean *you wish*? The party would never let that happen because democracy is not in their interest. They don't need to do primary at all. They are legally allowed to just pick their guy and you have no power whatsoever to stop them.
2096,This reminds me of the prophetic NYT election arrow.
2097,"I'll be voting in my local elections... but I won't be voting for president, because there's virtually no chance of Trump winning my state.  Clinton won my state by like 30 points in 2016, so it's hard to feel much urgency.  

My privilege is simply living in a state that doesn't matter.  It's too solidly blue to matter in general elections, it's too gerrymandered to matter in congressional elections, and it votes too late to matter in primary elections.  My voice has effectively been silenced by our electoral system.  [Roughly 70% of Americans live in non-swing states](https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/swing-states/)... I'd say that at least 50% of Americans live in a state that is mathematically almost impossible to flip in 2020.  So if a couple of people in safe states just can't stomach voting for a sexual predator, it's fine.  It's really fine.  We can focus on Congress and on supporting swing state voters who *do* have to make that unpleasant choice.  The majority of Democrats are okay with anybody who's not Trump, and that's fine too."
2098,"My suggestion to you and other people who agree with you reading this is to focus your energy on pressuring Joe Biden to become a more Progressive candidate if you think that the votes of the far left are so important. Or you can campaign on behalf of Joe Biden to moderate Republicans who could make a more compassionate choice in voting compassion over party lines.

I don't think it's helpful or moral to tell a leftist or Progressive that they have to vote for Joe Biden because he's not Donald Trump. that hasn't worked out well for us so far. Under Joe Biden, we will still fight Wars for oil and the most vulnerable Americans will still go homeless and unprotected. It's not on individual voters to make a less compassionate choice because of pressure from moderates."

2101,"Unless you value something greater than democracy, which I don't neccicarily value 100% of the time, it's dumb to not vote in your self interest. You raise a good point, your average poorer voter is disheartened. The solution to that isn't to capitulate to republicans, which is the effect of not voting.

Unless you long for the day that will never come, the grand violent revolution where the capitalists are dragged through washington bloodied and screaming, we need to understand that compromise is how you play the game. I don't like the game, but I'll play it because otherwise we are just going to trend more republican the less we vote.

I hate to say it, but it's true, anyone who doesn't vote for their own self interest and the interest of others shouldn't be shocked when the society they live in doesn't represent theirs, it represents the voting base. The solution to feeling unrepresented in this system isn't to lie down and take it like a defeatist, its to get active, start up grassroots movements and produce popular politicians such as AOC, i get that it's not easy, i get it, but its what needs to be done.

Bernie has a good message and a lot of policy i can get behind but his supporters don't vote. If he wants to be more successful it wouldn't kill him to compromise in a few small ways without neccicarily diluting his message."

Its fine, i don't need you specifically to vote, but the purity testing here is insane, if we act like that,we are never going to get anything done.

He had to he dragged kicking and screaming into being more respectful of women's rights. He doesn't care passionately about the issue the way Warren and Sanders clearly do. 

He's pretty much that way about everything. The guy is a wannabe meathead that challenges people to push up contests and threteaned to take a factory worker outside (implying a fight)

It's incredibly frustrating to watch a majority of Democratic voters just turn out for this guy. He's practically a blue dog."

Unfortunately, there likely won't ever be a serious investigation because the Biden campaign is well connected enough with the media to bury the story. The fact is we likely won't know much more than  we do now. It's simply up to each of us to decide for ourselves what we believe is most likely true. This is just another example of a powerful man escaping scrutiny."
2113,When has Bernie ever eaten shit as hard as Biden or Trump? He may be the same age but he's still sharp as a tack. [Did you hear him  spitting fire on the Senate floor yesterday?](https://twitter.com/People4Bernie/status/1242989219598884865) The man hasn't slowed down in 40 years.
2114,Biden isn’t going to win even if all Bernie supporters voted Biden. Bernie is going to be blamed anyway. Biden is Hillary Clinton 2.0; an uninspiring establishment Dem whose primary goal to make their donors rich.
2115,"Well, yeah.  At the state level, in some states a Republican may make the cut, but I doubt I would see one running for national level office I would be okay voting for."
2116,"Right, except for the differences between the “whys”.  Republican women might have been willing to support a rapist because “that would never happen to me” or “I’m not a slut and rape victims deserve it” or “he hates brown people as much as I do” or “he might get Roe overturned”.  While democrat women might support a rapist because “at least he doesn’t hate brown people” or “at least he will protect the gays and trans folks” or “at least he won’t try to overturn Roe”.  

A person who supports a rapist because of how openly and brazenly racist he is is still a garbage person in my book."
2117,"He's pushing overturning Roe V Wade and appointed a scotus judge who supports it.

He talked about the marriage equality thing, and said he opposes it, but hasn't cared enough to attack it because it would be an almost impossible fight. Nonetheless, having someone like that there still inspires violence and oppression against us nationwide. He's also attacked our rights in other ways, like the whole trans military thing."
2118,"No. Conservatives are the opposite of progressives. Liberals just choose to work incrementally within the system as opposed to only accepting complete revolution. Liberals listen to progressives all the fucking time and the accelerated leftward movement of even the moderate DNC in the past 10-20 years is evidence of that.

It's great to have ideals, but we have to work in reality and realistically even incremental change and a willingness to listen and evolve can have a more profound, meaningful, and  trackable impact on lives in the now compared to a lack of meaningful legal action until the revolution comes. We can't tell partners separated by Trump's Muslim ban, children torn from families and kept in cages, sick people losing meaningful access to health, women in states with narrowly closing if not gone already access to abortion, or LGBTQ folk (particularly trans folk) watching gains they've been hard fighting for for decades that. ""Sorry guys. But you can wait four more years, foxontherocks just isn't comfortable with Joe Biden :]""

An unwillingness to hold your nose for 30 seconds and vote for the only obstacle between Donald Trump until 2024 for the sake of marginalized people he's gunning for should be a black mark on your soul.

2119,"""75% of the nation refused to vote for Hillary"" you realize she won the popular vote right? More people wanted Hillary than Trump. Everyone who stayed home didn't do so because of the candidates. Only a handful did. 45% of voting age citizens didn't show up at all in 2016, and the number is always in that ballpark. That half of Americans who just don't care didn't ""refuse to vote for Hillary.""

She's not true leftist, but she's smart enough to know what her base wants. She wouldn't be trying to overturn Roe V. Wade, she wouldn't appoint Kavenaugh or any Republican, she wouldn't try to destroy marriage equality, snd while she sure af wouldn't have better foreign policy than Obama, at least she wouldn't be stupid enough to go around assassinating world leaders and daring everyone to nuke us. Because any of that would ruin her career. At least she has a base pressuring her to not do those things, while Trump's base is pressuring him to do all that and worse. 

And she doesn't represent fascism to such a point that fascist violence would escalate under her because suddenly everyone thinks it's socially acceptable to be bigoted again. She might have supported all those things at one point, but at least she doesn't now, meanwhile Trump **does.** 

I never said she or Biden would be good. They'd both be a shitshow. But they wouldn't be *as bad as Trump.* Not anywhere even close."

First of all, if people are seriously not voting for him because he's a rapist, *literally no policy will change their mind*. Second, his policies are *okay*, they're certainly more left than the decisions made in the past four years, and I also believe Biden is *just* malleable enough to be pushed into signing progressive legislation. At least those bills will pass in the blue House and Senate.

But yeah, progressive policies don't erase criminal actions. If Sanders was a rapist the same thing would apply.

> Or you can campaign on behalf of Joe Biden to moderate Republicans who could make a more compassionate choice in voting compassion over party lines.

There's no such thing as ""moderate Republicans"", if we're going to gatekeep ideology this is where I would draw the line. People who like the R will always like the R. 

Similar to how Republicans survive on their small but consistent base and also if no one else votes, Democrats win with their much larger but much more inconsistent base, but only if they vote at all. Personally, I find it ridiculous but probably *not untrue* that it's more possible to get Republicans to vote blue than to get progressive Democrats to vote at all.

>  I don't think it's helpful or moral to tell a leftist or Progressive that they have to vote for Joe Biden because he's not Donald Trump

Helpful, no. Moral, no. Practical, very yes.

> that hasn't worked out well for us so far.

Uhhhhhh, who's the one winning the Democratic Presidential Primary with higher turnout than 2016? Not Bernie ""the Socialist"" Sanders. If being outwardly progressive actually *worked*, this thread would not exist, the moral question of voting for a rapist will never even enter the lexicon. 

So yes, operating on the stance of ""Not Trump"" is working, and unless the accusation gets HUGE, unless there's hard evidence, and unless Biden fucks up his response entirely, let's face it, *it's not going to hurt him that much*.

> we will still fight Wars for oil

Even Trump isn't fighting wars for oil (he's trying to start wars for even dumber reasons) so I doubt it.

> and the most vulnerable Americans will still go homeless and unprotected. 

Yes, but under Trump, these vulnerable Americans will *never* have reprieve, and *even more* people will go homeless and unprotected. Nevermind that our government would still be lacking critical positions needed to work effectively, including a stance on climate change which at least Biden has, we're running into an outright *recession* even without the piss-poor way the current administration is handling the pandemic, basic rights for minorities will constantly be threatened, and when RBG inevitably *dies* the Supreme Court will be redder than Communism but will lack any potential good qualities.

> It's not on individual voters

Yes it is, because individual voters *not voting* is why we got in this mess. 

You can think about morality and progressiveness when your lack of action *doesn't* result in *more* people getting hurt. I personally do not see the morality in abstaining because I care more about what my ballot looks like than what it means. I'd rather be a devil on Earth than the only righteous person in hell (this sounded more clever in my head).

Either that or these ""I won't vote for a rapist"" types can actually do something that will change the country, like an actual fucking revolution like they say should happen, but I doubt even the ""I'll vote down ballot"" ones will remember to even go to the polls."

Under the agreement, all participating states' electoral votes will go to the winner of the national popular vote, regardless of the individual states' outcome.  Because they would have 270+ electoral votes controlled by this pact, it would be outcome-determinative.  Until there are enough states involved, everybody will continue as usual.

Biden represents everything that lower class white Americans hate, because it's been the policy of him and his party to say fuck them and ignore them. It's Biden and the policies of the Democrat party that directly led to Trump coming into office.

I don't agree with those who supported Trump, but I understand them. I live in South Carolina. I'm surrounded by those who voted for him.
For the majority of them, he was a great big fuck you to the Democratic party for abandoning them while giving mouth service to being for them. They were saying that if they were fucked then the rest of the country was going to get fucked if he wasn't being honest with them. Some believed him, but most around here thought that, if he was lying, that everyone else would be pulled down into the shit with them.

Yes, Bernie's ideas represent a change, an ideological change for many people. But his ideas, at their core, are simple. Care for human beings. Care for the environment. Build systems based on integrity and compassion, not rampant exploitation and greed. 

The thing is, in a republic, in democracy, people are supposed to have the power to create the world as we wish it to be.  Every part of our system is built by humans. Both physically and ideologically. So when the system fails, when it hurts people, or doesn't help those in need, *we can change it.*

In the meantime, federal and state grants can help to close the gap for institutions like UCB.

From a legal perspective, this seems like a total failure to negotiate a solution that prioritizes both keeping the lectures up and making them accessible to Deaf people.  It's not hard to think of solutions that could have been utilized to create closed captioning - there's auto-caption technology, and crowdsourcing captioning (or just auto-caption editing) is a common practice in many spaces.  Youtube, for example, has very straightforward tools that allow volunteers to caption or translate videos as they watch them.  I wish that UCB and DOJ had been more flexible in creating a solution.

Obviously I wish that the videos hadn't been taken down.  That really sucks.  But on some level, I see it as an unintentional wake-up call, that this is the lack of access Deaf people deal with on a daily basis.  Everyone complaining that they can't watch the lectures is just experiencing the same level of access to the lectures that Deaf people had when they were still online and free.  It's deeply unfortunate that so many are blaming Deaf people and government regulation designed to protect Deaf people rather than the university.  Deaf people aren't out here trying to get stuff taken away from hearing people, they just want hearing people to take their needs seriously and provide *reasonable* accommodations."

But there are many ways to critique that and to combat it, leading to this debate and ""lack of solidarity"" you're speaking about.

Not to mention, some forms of feminism are harmful to other women. Power feminism (in my opinion) seems to be mostly made for white women. TERFs 'protect women' by targeting trans women.

So as with any ideology, once you scratch the surface you'll see there's a huge depth and breadth to it.

Men also go to some of those countries to rape women, I watched a documentary on it, so it's just really offputting when an older man goes seeking for a young wife in certain places.. creepy. 

No one feels bad about ""losing them"", my heart just hurts a lot for the women stuck with them."

If they believe these women are more submissive and lenient, these views might be partially true but one can't put all men who find partners in such countries into one box. If you ask a random woman which man is attractive and tell them to pick only those from their surroundings, you mind be in for a surprise. If both parties are consenting then that's not my business. Women in these countries also can have agenda (as in, climbing the social ladder which is rather rare, or wishing the best for their family which is a bit more likely a scenario) or a say. This post seems ignorant to me, as I'm a EE myself and such arrangements happen very rarely and when they do, those women go for native celebs. You're more likely to find a happy interracial / intercultural couple than what you speak of. The Westerners are hardly a saviours like they think they are. Also, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and different people may value other things than that.

3. What even is that question? I'd rather stay alone than get together with a guy with a saviour complex or who believes in arranged marriages or buying a wife.

I won't lie that I would feel nothing.  It's very sad when a gorgeous-looking guy turns not innerly beautiful. But such guy doesn't worth sacrificing anything for him.

You can't understand why a man who has no social skills and zero success with ""Western women"" his own age going to a developing country, essentially purchasing a (usually very young) girl, taking her away from all her friends, family, and social connections, to a country with whose customs she is unfamiliar and whose language she may not speak very well or at all-- you can't see how that could be problematic? You can't see how that might not be super beneficial for the woman, who is now totally isolated and at the mercy of this man she barely knows? You can't see how that might be extremely lonely, at best, for that woman? You can't imagine how that situation might *go poorly* for her?

> If he gets a relationship he is happy with and she also gets a relationship she is happy with

If that's actually the case, well, good for them, but I don't really see that happening all that much.

I think the way you frame this relationship is in the very negative.  I am not sure why the man has to be exploitative or the girl has to be very young.  Although this is an assumption that you make.  

Have you met many people with relationships of this kind? 

I don;t think that comment is irrelevant.  The assumption you're making is that the male will be exploitative and will mistreat the girl.  However it's more likely the case the western male will be less patriarchal than the men in her home country."

You also specifically outlined an older, financially well-off man with low social skills/whatever who is attempting to find a wife from another country *because* he wants her to be subservient and submissive.

There is no real way around that while still trying to make relevant media. Sometimes you get lucky and can start, produce and release a major tentpole release within 18 months of its contents relevance, but most of the time, when movies or series hit the right spot, that right spot simply happened to hang around for longer (metoo being an excellent example).

I think New Warriors should have been killed off when it became apparent it missed its window of relevance, but killing off a project supposedly full of representation of minorites etc. is something few executives will dare in this day and age."

The Sexual Politics of Meat; A Feminist Vegetarian Critical Theory - by Carol J. Adams


Is exactly what you are looking for. You can find videos on youtube of her presentations on this topic as well, it was SUPER interesting."
2294,"As a vegetarian since 2004, I heard a lot of times that I should eat like a man and salads is a sissy thing.

So, in a personal experience, I can relate that."
2295,This is also the case with environmental issues. Apparently recycling and low carbon footprints are associated with femininity and vice versa.
2296,"If I had to guess, I would think it fits into the gender roles we've created for ourselves, i.e:

* men are hunters who kill animals to eat and still have this instinct  -e.g. big hunks of meat like steak
* men are supposed to be big and strong, women small and easy on the eye - so men eat protein rich, calorific foods like steak, women eat salad and 'health foods' like smoothies to stay small and good looking
* saloons/pubs/bars are for men to go and be men (I just learned that in the US, voting used to happen in pubs and bars, before women could vote), so it wouldn't surprise me that as women began being socially allowed to drink too, more 'palatable' and lower alcohol drinks than your typical beer and whisky were made"
2297,"I took a class in college for my Women’s Studies minor called Women, Eating and Food. It linked all sorts of things like violence against women to violence against animals, breastfeeding, eating disorders, family history through traditional recipes and dishes passed from woman to woman, etc. It blew my mind to explore the linkages and how things are connected. So indeed meat is gendered from that perspective. Men are encouraged to eat what they kill because its a sign of masculine dominance that mimics dominance over women. Really interesting class. Not an accident I became a pescetarian for a few years after that."
2298,"Stuff Mom Never Told You had an episode or two about this! Its been a while since I listened to it, but I can recommend it. :)"
2299,"Decades of advertisement by the meat industry associating meat (steak, mainly) with muscle growth by portraying stereotypically masculine men with meat. I would guess that things like fruity drinks are categorized as feminine because sweetness isn’t a difficult flavor to enjoy and therefore you can’t have a “tolerance” for it the same way you could for spicy, sour or bitter."
2300,"I think it stems form the patriarchal notion that all men must be physically strong and the meat industry latched onto that. They then perpetuated the ideal by enforcing these stereotypes and played on peoples' insecurities. I think this is what has led to meat being seen as a manly food and seeing as salad and vegetables are seen as the antithesis of meat I think it just naturally followed that these were then labeled as ""foods for women"". The whole situation is revolting, and the meat industry especially is abhorrent not only for the lies and stereotypes it perpetuates but also what it does to innocent animals."
2301,Apparently to be manly you need to die of heart disease.
2302,"My friend and I were talking about this, she told me to read :the sexual politics of meat by Carol J. Adam!"
2303,"I think it’s related to the common misconception that only meat supplies the protein needed to build muscle and be ‘strong’.

Which is false, you can get all your protein from plants. This misconception stretches to a lot of health foods being seen as feminine when they shouldn’t and vice versa"
2304,"I think maybe it’s that whole “hunter-gatherer” thing that people always push.

Man=Manly=hunts for food=stronger=only eat “strong” food=meat and things require hunting=strength=manlihood=man

I couldn’t put it into words that well so I hope the equation makes sense.

Also I learned in a sociology class that products tend to be gendered because it’s easier to sell if you have clear and distinct audiences. What is more clear and distinct than the fake gender binary and imposed gender roles?"
2305,"There have been a lot of good posts in this thread about why society considers meat 'manly' and 'healthy, skinny' foods feminine, but an interesting point is that a lot of the nutrients that are more present or only present in animal products are ones that women need in greater quantity than men to stay healthy.  Being vegan or vegetarian is actually \*harder\* for women."
2306,"I can’t say for sure why that is, but the association between meat+hunting and masculinity seems like a reasonable hypothesis. I’ve heard some people claim it’s biological, but even a grown man doesn’t need that much meat in their diet. The average American already eats way too much meat, so i reckon the difference between the amount of meat an American woman eats and the amount an American man eats is very based on gender roles.

Becoming a food server made me realize I was kind of a food sexist. Sometimes, when someone else takes the customer’s order, I still bring out their food. So if I’m bringing a meaty calzone and a fruity salad (or something like those items) to a heterosexual couple, and I don’t know who ordered which item, I often assume the guy ordered the calzone. 9/10 times, I’d be correct, but that first time I was incorrect made me feel bad like I’d shamed either/both of them when that was not at all my intention.

So now I always ask."

Though I think there might be a biological correlation for this stereotype (not a biologist or smth,  might be totally wrong, if anyone with more knowledge about nutrition knows more, please educate me). Men have more muscle mass in comparison to women (% and absolute). To gain and maintain muscles it is recommended to eat more protein, meat is a good source for protein. So I guess it could be possible that men have a larger appetite for meat in comparison to women and thus consume more meat."
2317,"Why? I really can't say.  I truly am convinced it's scientific that men crave protein more than women. I could cut out meat entirely and not really miss it much, but that doesn't mean I don't love a good steak.

Salads, smoothies, fruits and veg being for women is a real shame, however, and has much less legitimacy. I believe this stereotype is diminishing, luckily, as younger people aim to eat healthier than boomers. Or at least that's the change I see in the men I know."

FWIW, in the food service industry, they put the new recruits on salads/sides -- so they're usually firing the vegetarian dishes, too.  Usually, the worst cook in the kitchen is cooking vegetables.  So, it was just easier to eat omnivore at the time.

I've since started to cook more at home (now that I have a partner I live with -- cooking for 1 sucks up a lot of time/resources in America), and we both love whipping up delicious veggie/vegan food on a frequent basis."

2425,"to be honest, I have heard more about the latter, cishet men who date trans women, than the former. however I don't think that really reflects the way things *are* so much as what's visible.

I think that, until recently, trans masculinity was a lot less visible than trans femininity, and trans masculinity was largely folded, in the public eye, into the idea of being a butch gay AFAB person. lesbian culture also often provides safe space for trans masc people (not always, but often) which further ""blurs the line"". 

basically for many many decades I think that a lot of people who might self-identify as trans men or trans masc now were living as butches because that was the identity they could assume to find safe space and community. I think that still happens to a large extent - in my city, which has one of the most developed LGBT scenes in North America, trans men still attend lesbian events, even though a lot of them recognize the issue with that, because that's where there's a safe space for them. so when the identity of these trans masc people is outwardly ambiguous (maybe they only express that they are trans, rather than simply masc-presenting, to people they know will understand/recognize them) the identity of the women who date them is also ambiguous.

transfeminine people have also historically, to some extent, found space in gay communities, but I think the line between them and gay people of their birth-assigned gender has been drawn for longer. transfeminine people are generally more visible than transmasc people throughout the historical record - this is not at all a ""privilege"", it stems from different problems and comes with different consequences. visibility isn't always a good thing, and staying less visible, as I've kind of explained, can be a means of self-defense.

it's also been more acceptable for cishet men to have sexual relationships outside of a heterosexual marriage for a longer time, so the relationships cishet men have are more visible in general."
2426,What is with the 15 questions a day about dating or not dating trans people?
2427,"Most discussions like this involve rejecting trans women because we are the ones people feel comfortable casting as predatory, we are the hypervisible ones, and we are the ones stigmatized as undesirable outside of a fetishistic lens by default. It is rarely about dating trans women, and more about casting off guilt over not seeing us as actual members of our gender/sex, and not wanting to be seen as transphobic for doing so. 

To answer your question, anecdotally, it is more likely, but not by a huge margin. I think a somewhat recent study backs me up on that. 
Keep in mind that cis het men commonly take trans women as Sexual partners, but we often aren't considered worthy romantic partners due to stigma. The same applies with trans men to a lesser extent, given they aren't so heavily fetishized, but are still fetishized nonetheless."
2428,No one really knows. How would anyone know this?
2429,"Yeah, I think we should probably not entertain any more of these questions from this user. It’s starting to feel like the “but when exactly is it okay to hit women” kind of question."
2430,"Whenever we get so many repeats of the question, I assume several different conservative online outlets have shared talking points the posters think are relevant to feminism. And because they only see it on THEIR conservative outlet, they can't see the coordinated messaging campaign."
2431,I know right? There should be a separate sub for all these questions.
2432,Can you please explain about being hypervisible? Do tran women have a harder time passing than trans men or is it more the media concentrates on trans women when doing all the bathroom bill stuff?
2433,"It appears to be relevant in the current discourse as this topic is still new for most circles, and some people want to specifially look at it from a feminist standpoint."
2434,"When people read the word transgender, the overwhelming majority think of trans women. All of the major trsnsphobic slurs are primarily targeted to trans women. The overwhelming media coverage of trans people and our issues use trans women as a tool to validate their discussions. In the few times trans men are the focus, it is celebrating minor legal successes or talking about youth access to trans healthcare, generally drier material. Meanwhile trans women routinely have editorials and media segments attacking our validity and membership, we are portrayed in fetishists manner in one of the most popular and fastest growing categories of porn, as well as used as torture/trauma porn in medical/legal/police procedural often in a horribly negative and disgusting light. We are the primary targets of the ""bathroom bills"", and any other legislation restricting access to healthcare, rights, public spaces, employment, athletics, etc. We are cast as predatory, sexual deviants.

Trans men suffer the effects of invisibility, or reduced visibility. Some of this can at times be chalked up to ""passing"" politics, and how HRT affects them in ways estrogen and anti androgens don't affect us, but that is z minor impact.  

Trans women are hypervisible and cast in negative, stigmatized lights. This does impact how people measure our viability as partners, but it more readily affects how we are spoken of and how our existence is framed in discussions, how we are often framed as something being inflicted upon people/society and their resulting discomfort about that tends to be prioritized over actual acceptance of our existence. Folks want to be told it is okay to disregard us and they aren't bad people for doing so, regardless of their reasoning. Trans men rarely enter their thoughts in such moments of cis distress."
2435,"If you think men are inherently superior to women, than Trans Men enforce this view and Trans Women threaten it."
2436,Ok
2437,"No. Looking at your post history, you already knew this."
2438,"I was going to say “sure you could be just financially conservative”, but then I found these two definitions:

1. commitment to traditional values and ideas with opposition to change or innovation.

2. the holding of political views that favour free enterprise, private ownership, and socially conservative ideas.

Given that so many cultures have misogynist values and ideas, and conservatism seeks to prevent changing those values and ideas, I’d say no."
2439,"This is an interesting on. In the UK I've noticed that conservative party seems to have moved away from ""social"" conservatism, so you could say it is possible to be conservative without being misogynistic. 

However, conservatism seems to rely on the belief that we deserve what it is we have; that the reason one person is rich and another is poor is because one worked harder than the other. I realise not all conservatism believes this completely. The UK still provides benefits, even under a conservative government, but the belief that the rich deserve to be rich seems to be pervasive throughout conservative politics. This generally hits hardest on oppressed classes: women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ people. These people will go through added hardships that make it harder to get financial security in a conservative, capitalist society. 

For that reason, I think that no, it is not possible, since conservative politics adds to the hardship of women (as well as other marginalised groups)."
2440,"I think theoretically, sure-- a conservative individual (though I really think you should've defined this because this term can mean a lot of things-- it's loaded) could value traditionalism but at the same time make space for individual women to be independent/or autonomous-- I think you see this a lot in rural communities, which are typified as traditional/conservative.

I worked in a small rural community last year and the way gendered expectations were upheld/defied was definitely different than what might've been expected. What I would say about that experience is this: I was always treated with respect, but I wasn't always listened too and my competency wasn't always seen/valued. My male coworkers openly engaged in ""locker-room"" talk and it was frequently deeply uncomfortable and at times crossed the line out of professionalism-- but, there was a pretty equal balance in terms of men and women at my job. Despite the relative balance of gender representation in business and work etc. the town was heavily and stereo-typically gender segregated-- men had 'their' activities, clubs, and businesses, and women had different ones.   It was fine for women to work, but people were most uncomfortable with single women-- married women who worked were fine, people understood that, but for me, I was constantly being asked if and when I would marry my current partner-- by my male and female coworkers. It made them deeply uncomfortable and to some extent distrustful that I was an adult and unmarried.

So what I saw, and what I think, is that the traditional expectations are very limiting, and that for women living in those communities they could find respect and freedom of expression only in so much as they capitulated and adhered to certain expectations-- everyone had long hair and wore make-up, had kids, was married or wanted to get married, went to church, etc. And within those boundaries women wouldn't be subjected to open derision or disrespect, but women who were thought of as not adhering to those expectations certainly were.

Of course no one saw themselves as being 'misogynist' and felt that their capacity to have so many women in positions of leadership (even if it was segregated leadership) was proof that they didn't hate women-- but this was at the level of individual\* interaction, understanding, and, quite frankly, permission-- women who conformed otherwise could be given 'exceptions'-- so systemic sexism was still very much in existence and pretty much never acknowledged."

I can’t speak for anyone else here, only myself, but sure, you might not support Trumps fear mongering or various “isms” and phobias, maybe you just believe in strong borders and such... but you guys still saw that man, you heard him say he “grabs em by the pussy” and you heard him refer to Mexican immigrants as “murderers and rapists,” and all the rest of of that horrible shit. You heard him say he was going to threaten the rights gained by the lgbtq community and roll back gains made on the environment and you knew the man was accused of sleeping with a pornstar while married with a kid... and you said “yup! That’s the leader I want!” 

Calling anyone that made that choice doesn’t feel so wrong to me. Maybe Ud be more forgiving if I met anyone willing to condemn his actions. But dissent from the right is rare at best. 

But now that that’s out of my system, I get what you’re saying about generalizing, we should all strive to do it less. But generalizing is the reason feminism exists. Because the (mostly) conservative policies pushed by the right for decades, demand all women be subservient mothers and housewives."

2476,"You know...There are women, that would like to way the life you just depicted...

I think, the main problem is that, conservatives force their way of life on other people. But at the same time there are feminists which want to force their way of life on conservatives, that's why there's a war between these two groups. If instead we thought about happiness of an individual and let everyone live the way they want, I think it would be much better. 

Forcing a conservative to live the perfect life of a feminist is as bad as forcing a feminist to live the perfect life of a conservative.

If a woman wants to live the life you just depicted, I am happy for her, because it's her happiness and she deserves to follow her path. 

Problem arises, when there's no consent. When one forces another to live the way the first wants to. It doesn't matter which side it is."
2477,"That’s interesting , I hear conservatives condemn his actions all the time. They just say they vote for him because of taxes or whatever. (Libertarians)  Sure they still wrong for voting for him, but I know a lot of right leaning folks that genuinely hate him as well."
2478,"I thought that hatred manifests through these things. Like, shaming and so on. Since, people are not interested in women's happiness. 

But, it doesn't mean that all conservatives are not interested in women's happiness. It all becomes problematic, when you start forcing your way of life on other people. Instead, you can be a conservative, be tolerant and appreciating all ways of life, and still decide that the way your family would look because it depends your happiness. You can find a SO that would also be conservative (with the same set of values and opinions) without forcing to live by your rules. I think that's OK, because everyone in the family or whatever would keep in mind happiness of another human being. 


The main difference is consent. Problem of conservatives is that they often want to force people live the way they want to. But I can't say that feminism movement doesn't have the same sin. 

The root of the problem I think, is that we have only one big way of regulating the way we live (through the government) if we instead make dozens, hundreds little governments, it would be much easier to live life the way you personally want, since there would be tons of places living differently and to choose from."

2494,">For example a man should push a woman out of the way of an oncoming car first before thinking of himself.

I disagree with this. I think there are aspects of life where it makes sense for men to help/protect women. For example, walking a friend home because you know there is a sexual predator in the area, or reaching something high up. This obviously depends on the man and woman; just because men are on average bigger than women, doesn't mean every man in bigger than every woman. 
However, I don't believe a man should effectively kill himself (getting hit by a car could easily kill you) to protect a woman. Some people do things like that out of instinct but it is definitely not a duty. 

>So my question is from a feminist perspective do women want men to have an ingrained sense of duty to protract them. 

I don't want to be protected; I want to not need protection."
2495,"I mean I think we all have a duty to try and help others wherever we can but I don't think it is as simple as ""men protect women because strong"".

For example, I was in a pub once where a simple misunderstanding led to a near confrontation between a random belligerent drunk bloke and a young French-Vietnamese guy who didn't have amazing English with the latter being utterly bemused. 

I am female, British, achingly middle class and white and have ""teacher/authority"" figure written all over me. I stepped in, explained that it was all a terrible mistake and basically let the drunk guy talk himself out while nodding and saying ""I understand"" until he toddled off.

I could do that because as a woman and socially coded as ""not a threat but not to be attacked"" I was less likely to have him swing at me. If he had kept being antsy I would have gone and got some staff.

In that situation my perceived lack of strength and physical threat was actually an advantage in protecting someone."
2496,"Do men have a duty? No. No one has a duty, regardless of gender/sex. It would be nice of a person to help someone else if they are in danger, but have no duty to do so."
2497,"Not really.  While everyone should do what they can to help each other, and no one should cause physical danger to another person, I don’t see a special burden falling on a man.  In the example you gave, why would a woman need to be pushed out of the way merely on account of sex?  Women are capable of moving on their own.  Sure, if the woman seemed unaware that would be one thing, but a man could be equally unaware and need help.  Absolutely teach people to look out for each other, but that’s independent of gender."
2498,"No, I believe that ""ingrained sense of duty"" is an expression of toxic masculinity. Men don't owe women anything, just like women don't owe men anything."
2499,"Well, I guess it would be a good start for men to stop BEING the physical danger to women."
2500,"> For example a man should push a woman out of the way of an oncoming car first before thinking of himself.

This is an odd example because physical strength buys you pretty close to nothing in this scenario. If they get hit by a car, a 100-lb person and a 200-lb person will be approximately the same degree of dead. I guess someone’s strength may be helpful in being able to move someone else in the first place, but I suspect anyone you ask (definitely including the hypothetical driver) would prefer that the people in question both get out of the way and not get hurt. 

There’s precious little benefit to one person getting harmed instead of another in most circumstances, and few real-world scenarios outside of PHIL 101 thought experiments where one person gets to sit around and contemplate putting themselves in harm’s way instead of someone else. If you have time to plan it out, chances are pretty good that you could use that time to minimize harm to all involved instead."
2501,"I think a stronger person will often feel a certain responsibility to protect those more vulnerable than them. But that doesn't apply in any sort of fixed way to men and women. And strength definitely isn't the only factor. If there were a woman beside me being assaulted and I felt I could help I would, in the same sense I would a man in the same situation. But it has more to do with whether I felt confident to help or not, but generally speaking I don't think helping other people should be avoided if they seem to be in genuine need."
2502,"No, I think they (as well as every human) has a duty to not use their strength against others to harm them."
2503,No thanks. I urge you to look up articles on “benevolent sexism”.
2504,"I think that strong people should protect weak people.  But that’s in all areas, not just  physical strength, and all men aren’t stronger than all women.

To put it a different way, we all should be taking care of people less fortunate than us.  That doesn’t mean rich people should be taking bullets for poor people.  It means being aware of what your advantages are, and being more aware around people that don’t share those advantages."
2505,"People who are physically capable of helping others should do so.  There's no reason to men helping or ""protecting"" women.  I, a fit woman in my 20s, would likely be more capable of providing aid to a man who is old, disabled, or ill than vice versa.  Probably plenty of other men too.  He shouldn't feel any duty to me just because I'm a woman.

>For example a man should push a woman out of the way of an oncoming car first before thinking of himself.

This is really your example?  Men's and women's relative average strength is irrelevant when it comes to being *hit by a fucking car*.  You do not have a duty to women, specifically because they are women, to sacrifice yourself to save them from an oncoming vehicle.  If you were to do that for anyone you would be a hero and that's fabulous but there's no reason to make it a gendered thing."
2506,"I would say *people* should ideally feel a sense of duty to help *each other* in whatever way they can. Being stronger than someone else could be an advantage in some cases, but \[a\] that doesn't necessarily apply to all men (I know some very small dudes), and \[b\] it's not going to be a factor in all situations (most people could push someone else out of the way of an oncoming car). I also don't like the idea that being stronger should automatically make you more disposable, and I don't think anyone should be obligated to help a random stranger at the expense of their own safety. 

But yes, help who you can, when you can. If I see someone in danger, then I'd like to think I'd try to help, whether they're a man or a woman, and whether I'm a man or a woman."
2507,[removed]
2508,Everyone should have a sense of duty to protect each other regardless of gender/strength/size/age etc.
2509,"I mean I definitely don’t think it’s gendered, but I do think we all have a duty to help people in danger if we are able to. Imagine you walk by a toddler drowning in a little pool for kids. Your reaction definitely shouldn’t be, “it’d be nice if I pulled them out but I have no duty to.”"
2510,"Good Samaritan laws are a thing, as popularized in the series finale to *Seinfeld*."
2511,"Hello thanks for your comment I would like to elaborate on your statement that men don’t owe women anything and women don’t owe men anything. 

Would you say then that in dangerous situations everyone for themselves would be the ideal situation? Because one example I can think of where men have an ingrained sense of duty and I don’t think counted as toxic masculinity is on the deck of the titanic. 

As the ship was going down and the lifeboats were being launched it was women and children only on the boats and men stayed behind. If it was everyone for themselves I could see that since men are physically stronger they’d just be able to shove most women out of the boat and save themselves. In this way I feel this practical example shows that this thinking does have a benefit for women. What are your thoughts?"
2512,Especially because so many of the men who assert that it's their manly duty to protect women are the same men who feel entitled to impose their physical dominance over women and actually end up posing the greatest threat to us.
2513,So you agree that men should feel a duty to protect women then? Since this would be the opposite of harming them?
2514,"Thanks for the response and I agree that the stronger person will often feel a sense of responsibility to protect those more vulnerable. The reason I brought gender into it is that due to biology most men are stronger than most women and thus would be more inclined to feel the need to protect them.

I also think that if this sense of responsibility went down there would be less men willing to help a woman being assaulted."

2518,"Yeah - but they aren’t a duty to help people, it’s to protect any person who chooses to help from legal action."
2519,"It is still toxic imo because it's saying women are more precious and should be handled with care. Children are an entirely different story. I'd like to clarify that toxic masculinity is not just stuff that's ""bad for women or men."" It's the harmful ideaology that women have their place and men have a different place. There can be rewards and consequences from toxic masculinity, but it's bad because of the structure it puts on our people. It puts men and women in different boxes, do you see what I mean?

On the Titanic, it should have been even amounts of men and women."
2520,"That's not what I said. I see a moral obligation for everyone to be a decent human being and to offer aid when possible, but that is no ""duty"" and goes for everyone, regardless of gender.  


What I meant before: most physical threats to women are caused by men. Not being an asshole who beats up/rapes/threatens women is what we expect of you and no: this is not the same as being a protector.   


I'm sure you mean well, but there is a thing called benevolent sexism where you still don't see women as your equals. For example by thinking they need protection because they can't do that themselves."
2521,"Not who you were responding to, but the idea that the big strong men should protect the small weak women is sexism. It doesn't matter whether it ostensibly ""benefits"" women or not, it's still sexist."
2522,"Depends on where though, here you are obligated by law to help a person in need, unless you think you would be risking injury/death by doing so."
2523,"True - requiring a duty to assist is rare - Good Samaritan statutes in the states of Minnesota, Vermont, and Rhode Island *do* include it, but most do not."
2524,I hear you but if it was everyone for themselves as you originally stated it wouldn’t be even numbers of men and women it’d be mostly men since they have the physical ability to push women out of the way. I’m not talking the ideology that women are more precious than men im focusing mainly on the differences in physical ability and whether that should factor into male decision making.
2525,"I hear you but I don’t agree that what I’m saying is benevolent sexism. Benevolent sexism is basically putting a different value on women based solely on their gender. Btw a moral obligation and a duty are synonymous. 

What I’m saying is that I agree with your statement that men should not harm women. But instilling a sense in men that they shouldn’t protect women from physical harm will lead to more men harming women. This is because you can’t teach people not to be assholes... you have to teach them to be the opposite of an asshole. Which in my view is a person is understands his physical strength and makes decisions to use his strength to protect rather than harm."
2526,Where do you live????
2527,"This doesn’t include personal intervention though. It just requires that people at least notify law enforcement of and/or seek aid for strangers in peril under certain conditions. It’s a super gray area however, as it requires the general public to have the same understanding as to what constitutes danger, which obviously cannot be the case."
2528,"I didn't say ""everyone for themselves."" I am specifically saying that men and women don't owe anything to the opposite sex. Men don't have a sense of duty because they're physically stronger, just like women don't have a duty to bear emotional labor.

I believe it's harmful to perpetuate the idea that men have a duty to protect women because they're stronger. Society has a duty to protect people, but it has nothing to do with gender."
2529,"Our discussion is merely academic, I guess in reality we would both teach our sons the basically same thing.   


As a woman, I don't feel comfortable with your wording because I don't want men to see me as someone who needs protection. So, to reach your goal without falling in the trap of benevolent sexism, I suggest to indeed teach men a general understanding of strenght, yes, but without focussing it only on women. A strong, but gentle person should aim to protect anyone who can't do this themselves. There are plenty of women who don't need your protection, while there are also a wide array of men who indeed do.

A duty and a moral obligation are not the same though as moral is a subjective thing."

2531,"> It’s a super gray area however, as it requires the general public to have the same understanding as to what constitutes danger, which obviously cannot be the case.

I think that's partially why it's far less of an infraction than Seinfeld portrayed it - RI is a fine, and Minn. is a petty misdemeanor. 

I think it's kind of like the current shelter-in-place laws - they're only going to use it for gross violations."
2532,"I’m not sure this makes sense. In your original comment you said men don’t owe women anything and women don’t owe men anything. Now you say that society has a duty to protect people. I think these 2 statements fundamentally oppose eachother since society is made up of men and women. 

I agree with your comment that society has a duty to help people but if we break it down it’s basically saying that those who are able should help those who are more vulnerable. Which is exactly what I’m saying."
2533,Absolutely I feel like we would raise the same kind of men. Also my apologies you’re right duty and moral obligation are not the same. I feel like a duty is the action that follows a moral obligation.
2534,"Leave gender out of it and we'd agree. Society is not individual people, it's governments and committees and leaders who follow rules made up by other people. It's whoever decided ""women and children get on first."" That entity (whether it's one person or multiple) has a duty to protect PEOPLE. Not women, not men, all people. So the decision on the Titanic should have been ""children first, then men and women together.""

Sorry if I'm not explaining this well. My only issue is that you're making this a gendered subject, instead of a ""philosophical moral duty"" type of conversation."
2535,We all owe each other. Men don’t owe women any more than they owe other men.
2536,"I’m glad we can have an honest discussion on this topic and I agree that society has a duty to protect people. The only reason I’m bringing up gender though is because there is a biological difference between men and women and that there should be a philosophical moral duty based on that biological difference. 

I agree with you that men and women have the same value, that is not in question but on the titanic when rules and order were breaking down. They were not going to put equal amounts of men and women on the life boats. So who should be left behind? I feel it’s men since if they had to swim for safety they would be more likely to survive just based on biology."
2537,"Based on biology, since women have higher body fat percentages that helps to survive longer in cold water and have greater muscle endurance than men, in that particular situation they would have a better chance surviving provided they could get off the ship safely and didn’t have too much heavy clothing.  In the event of a maritime accident in cold water, men would be ‘the weaker sex’ in need of protection."
2538,"I think it's really problematic to push that kind of ideology. Rules and order broke down on the Titanic and they reverted to the tried and true sexist approach. 

The problem I see from this idea is that you're telling individual men to protect individual women from danger. Your example about a man pushing a woman away from an oncoming car is problematic. Men should not be taught that they have a duty to protect women.

A weird but I think appropriate analogy just came to mind, so stay with me... Are you familiar with the arguments involving men who wish to terminate parental rights?"
2539,I’m not really familiar with the concept of men who wish to terminate parental rights. But I’m assuming that it means men who no longer want to be a father and give up responsibility of their child. This is done sometimes when a government takes over the care of a child.
2540,"No, but I think that it is a factor in some of the spread. I personally know men who scoffed at the idea of getting sick, ""it's just the sniffles,"" ""I won't be told what to do,"" etc. One man in particular said that he wasn't going to change his habits, or even start washing his hands more often, because, and I quote, ""I consider myself anti-fragile.""

2541,"No. Coronavirus is the direct result of human encroachment on natural habitats-- it came from a man getting bitten by a bat. Notably, many other common human diseases are also from our close proximity to animals-- both wild and domesticated. 

I think there could be an argument that the hubris of toxic masculinity has resulted in a lack of response to the virus in some places, but I also think that's just people being people and it isn't a gender-bound issue.

I also think that climate change and some of the other existential issues we face as a species are [more directly the result of colonialism](https://worldcrunch.com/culture-society/colonialism-the-hidden-cause-of-our-environmental-crisis?fbclid=IwAR3hBPZQmKC1UYJwF1DyIX_4AdwJ6Xi0ift_kmLXPRZbTLmCqzls929_RaY), which I guess in a roundabout way can be attributed to toxic masculinity."

2547,"For me the moment of realisation came when I was about 17 and studying Government and Politics in school. We looked at different politics ideologies and one of them was Feminism. The textbook we had defined Feminism (roughly, this was 10 years ago now) as ""The belief that women are currently disadvantaged in society due to their gender and that action needs to be taken to change this for the better"". I was like ""Oh yeah ok I believe that.""

I still think that is the best definition of Feminism that I have ever come across tbh."

Feminism should be defined as “the opposition to patriarchy and discriminatory gender norms at all levels of society in favor of full gender and sexual liberation for all.”  
This definition excludes TERFs, SWERFs, libfems, tradfems, and gender essentialists."
2552,"I like your definition, but the simpler definition is more accessible, which is critical for effective communication with anyone who hasn't already studied patriarchy, discrimination, or sexual liberation. 

My biggest struggle in being autistic is in choosing how to modify my message for its intended audience; it's why I sometimes shut down from overwhelm instead of being able to speak at all.  I don't know what is best for the dictionary because it depends on the reader, but I'd think simpler is better for the widest audience."

2555,"I'm an anarcha-feminist. I'm not interested in a simple inversion of hierarchy. I'm interested in ending all oppressive hierarchies. In general, feminists are interested in abolishing gender-based oppression, which incidentally also includes the ways patriarchy negatively impacts men.

Also, things like harassment in the workplace, the wage gap or objectification of women seem insurmountable at times. Then a discussion about shaving ones legs or not gives us a little break. It doesn't mean leg hair is truly important to us.

As someone who deals almost entirely with men at work I'm sometimes completely overwhelmed by the harassment, the groping, the lower pay and the men who treat me like an animal. I educate, set boundaries and push men's limits daily. Sometimes on the weekend it's good to take a break and talk about skin care for women in the trades! Basically, after living it all week, I don't want to talk about it.

Does that make any sense? Sometimes it's hard to know if I'm explaining things very well..."
2570,"You are right, partly. There are feminists like you described, talking more about looks, but there are also feminists like you - battling everyday sexism, media portrayal and such. I consider myself to be one of the last category. The first category, however, isn't ""less"" than the second, they discuss the same ideas in different ways. They want women to feel comfortable without make up in reaction to how women are portrayed in media, they want women to be able to choose their clothing in reaction to how objectified women are... That's all themes discussed by both groups of feminism. The first group focusses more on the ""look"" aspect of feminism and less on other aspects, but that's where the second group steps in. I like to think of them as complementary, not contrary - one fills the void the other leaves.

It has to be said though that the first group is way more visible than the second, so that's where anyone could get the idea that that's the only thing feminists talk about. Both groups exist, though, the first one is just a little more vocal."
2571,"I'm not on Instagram, I'm talking about the image of this (needless to say) very serious and important movement in the eyes of people around me which only see the most famous blogs and accounts."
2572,"Absolutely, that's exactly what I said in the post.

However my point is, these sources are much more visible, and they create the image for feminism because of it.

The only decent resources I find are UN Women, and some subreddits here but with a lot of confused people."
2573,"Please respect our top-level comment rule, which requires that all direct replies to posted questions must come from feminists and must reflect a feminist perspective. Comment removed; you will not be warned again."
2574,"Exactly what I mean.

My guy friends aren't aware of the actual problems and think it's all about what women wear (very leisurely topic for a third world country)."
2575,"I agree, I can't deny that the first group does help.

However, the help it offers (which is widely visible) could help a woman with the doubt she gets about her looks everyday, which is super important, but on the other side it hasn't helped with the media portrayal for example. furthermore, it assigns the words ""women rights"" to looks and clothes for the audience, which makes the problem a little worse.

Tl;Dr: first group helps me go out without makeup, but doesn't change the people's views to me, which is the main problem here."
2576,So... show them something else?
2577,"> The only decent resources I find are UN Women

I mean... really? The ""only"" ""decent"" source?
 
Maybe... I dunno. Literally try at all.

2578,Yeah I’m pretty sure that you prioritize to talk about different problems. Something that’s a major feminist problem in first world countries is definitely human trafficking and the exploitation of sex workers. I think this would catch much more attention & people would unterstand why feminism is necessary all around the globe.
2579,"Agreed. That's why I consider myself to be one of the second group, that's more about deeper structural change."
2580,"I am doing what I can.

However lately, in my country, ""feminist"" has become an insult. I am trying to understand how could a movement about some humans' rights can be shameful."
2581,I am clearly talking about social media here. I also don't understand why you are so mad.
2582,"Feminism has never been broadly popular, and since it's inception people will latch onto anything as an excuse to discredit it.

That's not any different in the west vs. the east-- and I think it's worth pointing out that fighting the status quo (regardless of what injustice is being fought) is rarely popular or beloved when it's first getting going.

You can make the most impact by understanding that, and, when you see people you are close too blowing off something you think is important or consuming sources of information that leave a lot to be desired-- be the voice in the room that speaks up, that shares meaningful information, etc, rather than giving credence to what are the most basic and most common 'criticisms' about feminism that exist."
2583,Lmao feminist is an insult used widely now because what I like to call “Buzzfeed” feminists spread the idea that we complain about useless ideas. Complaining about people man spreading is like telling us wearing bras is wrong.
2584,"Probably because of your declaration that *no Western feminists* are talking about anything other than, like, what to wear and no one's addressing systemic issues. It is, frankly, insulting."
2585,"I'm not mad, I just don't think that you have a legitimate criticism here. 

This a bit of a snake eating it's own tail you've got here, social media sources of feminism are too shallow, but there aren't other sources, but then when I provide other sources you're only talking about social media.

But here's the other thing: plenty of serious, academic feminists have social media accounts that you can follow. You just, literally, have to try.

Chimamanda N'gozi Adiche has a twitter, Rebecca Solnit has a twitter, Malala Yousafzai has a twitter. 

Like all you have to do is identify someone who is a ""serious"" feminist and then go follow them. Like I said-- the issue is with your sources, literally, who you follow-- not with the movement or philosophy."
2586,"The first half of your comment is the helpful discussion I was waiting for.

However, again, I am not saying feminism is shallow, I'm saying that I'm a feminist and I'm viewed as shallow, and some people around me give me the look of ""why would you follow such a shallow movement"", and I'm trying to find out why they think so.

So there was no need to say I'm offending feminism because I'm literally the victim here."
2587,"I didn't mean to offend a group of people, but I'm talking about them famous posts which are mostly coming from a first world country point of view."
2588,"You see this isn't about me, I thought I was clear about that. 

I'm saying that the most trendy posts on social media (not just *my* social media) are like that. Which has created a dumb stereotype about feminism.

I am clearly not offending the movement."
2589,"Have you seen the questions here? 

We all get accused of the same stuff... it's exhausting and even more exhausting for you to entertain it and act as if there are no valid platforms for decent information on social media when there are. If you want people to view you differently, you have to counter their arguments with something substantive which will require you to develop a repertoire of substance-- feminism is an active practice and you won't change how the people around you feel about women or feminism by repeating their criticisms to other feminists. 

It's work. And it's work everybody has to do in their personal lives to effect change at a broader scale. 

Of course pop culture platforms aren't going to tackle the 'deep' systemic issues-- what's most bizarre to me about this whole thread is your expectation that these platforms should or could fill this role."
2590,"The 'you' I'm using in this case can be applied generally too though-- if what people want to look for in feminism is excuses to dismiss it, then any aspect of anything anyone says will be take out of context and minimized-- clothing choice and make-up, while maybe seeming 'insignificant' to you or other men who don't live with the pressure to look and dress a certain way (and spend a certain about of $$ to do that, btw) to be seen as credible, respectable, valuable, sometimes even human-- are actually pretty important and while maybe not comparable as an issue to human trafficking, are definitely legitimate issues and shouldn't be belitted just because it's harder for you or some other lay person to understand their impact.

If you're an ally you make you an effort to understand the issue and if you just want a reason to blow something off you'll find it\*.

Dismissing these discussions as shallow or pointless, or as being 'injurious' broadly to the effort for women's rights is actually a hilarious expression of misogyny-- discussing women as vain, shallow, and incapable of seriousness is right up in the top 10 for negative stereotypes about women so uh, good job feeding that beast.

Thanks so much for your support."
2591,"I made this post to know whether this criticism is right or not. Because I'm pretty sure criticism can be helpful especially if a shallow image of feminism is more widely spread (again, in my community) rather than the actual message.

So your last sentence was what I was expecting by making this point. That's an actually valid point right there so thank you for that."
2592,"So I guess I'm a man now.

Dear I am clearly not offending any aspect of feminism. My post is directly about how much these famous platforms are helping in comparison to the power they have. Which is, based on my view which I came here to ask whether it was right or not, not enough, and has created the stereotype that feminism is only about clothes and looks.

However I have mentioned in another thread how these posts help me personally, but it doesn't help with the structural issue of (women should look like that, etc...) Which is one of the problems women face every day. I'm saying that based on what I hear from my very small community, and which, again, I'm here to know whether it's a general idea or not."
2593,"I mean, from your post history, pretty sure that's how you self-identify but my apologies if I'm wrong.

From my other response to you: You can make the most impact by understanding that feminism is not broadly popular or beloved, and, when you see people you are close too blowing off something you think is important or consuming sources of information that leave a lot to be desired-- be the voice in the room that speaks up, that shares meaningful information, etc, rather than giving credence to what are the most basic and most common 'criticisms' about feminism that exist."
2594,... For just any reason? Fully naked? Not really for a variety of reasons that have less to do with prudishness and more to do with health and hygiene-- but I do think that if some people are going to be given the right to be partially or fully naked in a public space then it shouldn't discriminate against one group or another and should be granted to everyone equally.
2595,"From a hygiene perspective, I don't think that would be appropriate."
2596,How do you feel about frostbite on sensitive body parts?
2597,"I mean jeah fully naked , is ur butt less hygienic than ur hands?"
2598,Good luck with your impending cases of hepatitis and ringworm.
2599,"I would say that recognizing that you have a problem with internalized misogyny is the first step. I would recommend reading literature centered around women’s experiences.

Reading about the lives of others increases empathy and helps us as humans to understand and appreciate the experiences of others. It’s why it is so important to read about stories that give you a new perspective with characters you don’t think you’ll empathize with. If you’re feeling at all like you don’t like other girls or that women are so [insert stereotype here—b*tchy, vapid, catty, etc.] reading about the lives of other women is a really good way to overcome this.

A few books with good female characters that I’d recommend:

Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng (novel about a biracial family in a very white, 70s town)

Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides (novel about a intersex person who was raised as female and struggles with identity)

Before We Were Yours (A novel based on true events about a child kidnapping ring in Tennessee)

Elenor Oliphant is Completely Fine (novel about an antisocial woman living on her own—that description doesn’t do it justice—it’s so good)

Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Adichie (war novel with split perspectives)

There are A TON of others. Head over to r/suggestmeabook to get more recommendations that are more specific to your interests.

(I don’t know how old you are, but if you are younger, you might like Song of the Lioness or Spindle’s End)"
2600,"Maybe it’s a good idea to think about what you find inspiring about those men. Is it related to them being a man in any way? It’s perfectly healthy to look up to whoever inspires you, but do the positive qualities these people represent to you have to do with their masculinity? Are you envious of something that maybe you associate with men? For example, I know women who really envy men’s generally easier time getting gains in the gym. I don’t think that’s misogyny at all, it’s just that some people’s bodies line up with their preferences / lifestyle more than others, and it’s natural to want a little of what your neighbor has.

It may be that you just happen to resonate with the life experiences or accomplishments of certain men on a human level, and it’s got nothing to do with gender.

Another commenter mentioned that the feeling of euphoria when being misgendered is less common in cis people, and while it seems like you did explore your feelings on that, maybe that’s a topic for further introspection. 

It may be that you want to be accepted as a part of those male social groups because you feel it confers a status as a member of the in-group or makes you feel as if you’re taken seriously, which is a bit problematic because a woman’s recognition of your worth should equal the value of a man’s, given they’re equally close to you.

I have experience dealing with very similar problems to yours, although I can’t really get into it since I use this account for everything and not everyone is accepting or kind. My advice would be that although it’s good to analyze your own thoughts and perspective in the pursuit of being a better or more aware person, you shouldn’t be too critical for just being your authentic self. Personally, I’ve had some mental health issues over those kind of things and can feel isolated when I get too hung up on it. If you end up hanging out with dudes a lot, that doesn’t mean something’s wrong with you necessarily. Try to be happy with yourself while still asking questions. 

Sorry for wall of text, might have to delete this later but I wanted to reach out. Good luck."
2601,"Can I ask how you came to understand that you were a woman with internalized misogyny rather than a nonbinary or trans person with internalized misogyny? I only ask because feeling good about being mistaken as a guy doesn't seem like something that is fully explained by internalized misogyny to me. Although I don't personally struggle with internalized misogyny as deep as you are describing so maybe that's just not my experience.

As far as tips go I would say just keep looking for feminist content stuff that blatantly deconstructs the myths of women's inferiority. And when you engage with it and uncomfortable feelings pop up don't stuff them down. Sit in your discomfort and try to examine those feelings and where they came from."
2602,"I want to point out that liking stereotypical feminine things (ie dresses, the color pink, heels, etc) is a very empty, unreliable, and misogynistic way to determine you are female. You are female no matter what your aesthetic preferences are; you are female if you wear a plastic bag or a gown. You are female if you are nurturing, you are female if you can’t stand children. You don’t need anyone’s permission to have individual characteristics or preferences and identify as a woman, because you are a woman with or without any number of these things. 

Similarly, stereotypical feminine *character identifiers* seem to be what might be contributing to your internalized misogyny. 

For example: Women are not inherently polite, that is a myth, and it’s an objectively misogynistic standard to assign to women. Good humans are polite. 

Women are not inherently kind, nurturing, empathetic, etc— any human can be these things, it doesn’t just automatically come with your chromosomal makeup. And if you aren’t these things, then you are simply a *woman* who isn’t kind or nurturing or empathetic (or the inverse with the negative stereotypes: meek, insecure, incapable), but a woman nonetheless. 

My advice would be to spend some time reflecting on the qualities about yourself that you are most proud, and even those where you recognize you need some work— accept that those things are what make you an *individual* and then separately, how you can use those qualities about yourself to lift up other women and put an end to the notion that “a woman must be feminine, or she is not truly a woman”. 

I am cheering for you, because you are very obviously the type of person who is interested in optimizing your worldview— that’s a hugely mature and integral way to be, and suggests you are someone who acts with good and genuine intentions."

2604,"Thank you for the reccomendations! Since my country is in lockdown at the moment, I have a lot of time to read. At the moment I feel drawn to the Elenor Oliphant one, also because learning to be fine on my own is something I'm working on at the moment. I'll try to get my hands on a copy soon!"
2605,"First of all, thank you for your comment! 
When it comes to understanding if I am a woman, a trans man or a nonbinary person, Im actually not sure, but based on the fact that I like my body as it is, I concluded I am certainly not a trans man. Nonbinary could be it but I still don't know. At the moment I have concluded that I am a woman, and if I would be nonbinary after all then I'd still be quite feminine.
I think the feeling good about being mistaken for a man originates more from the feeling of being included as ""being one of them"". An example for this is I posted a picture of my battlejacket on reddit and a commentor said ""nice jacket dude"" but one of my friends, who is on reddit too, commented ""op is not a dude"" and so the other person changed their comment. I remember feeling irritated by my friend because of this and then I was like wait... Why am I feeling this? In this case, I think 'dude' was more used to say ""I'm being friendly and cool towards you"" instead of ""I think you are a man""
Anyway I think it could very well be possible that my struggles with internalised misogyny are tied to me questioning my gender, but for now I will go with the assumption that I am a woman."
2606,"I think that this is an interesting thread.

I struggle with internalized misogyny, myself, and I am a trans-feminine person.  I became aware of the internalized misogyny well before I realized I was transgender, though.

Another difference between me and u/skatavinge is that I was emphatically *not* raised in a feminist household.  I was raised by a father who taught me racism, sexism, classism, ableism, and pretty much every prejudice we have a name for.

In my case, I think that I internalized that misogyny in great part because of experiencing an unfilled desire to earn my father's approval, which remains unfilled to this day.

Since OP states emphatically that she was raised in a very feminist household, I can't help but wonder if the misogyny was taught from some source outside the household.

A lot of the material I've read about mental health traces our most deeply internalized values to the way we were raised, so I would suggest to OP to carefully consider what she learned about being female from her parents and caregivers.

Being raised as a boy, I can say, for instance, that my misogynistic father made clear to me that he believed that female is inferior, however, at the same time, he had very inflexible ideas about what a man should be like.  Without knowing more about OP, I wonder if it might be possible that she could have been raised by parents who taught her to take pride in being female, but perhaps (whether intentionally or not) set standards about *how* to be female that she couldn't measure up to."

2608,"I almost put it down in chapter 2,  but don’t do that! The beginning is a little cringey but it’s supposed to be that way and it makes sense as the story goes on"
2609,"Thank you for commenting and sharing your thoughts! I have been reflecting on my upbringing and on the possible sources of my internalised misogyny, and I'll give you my findings. 
With being raised in a feminist household, I mean that my mom and dad were both lumberjacks, and so I was thaugt that gender didn't really matter. If my mom could drive huge machinery and work with a chainsaw then why couldn't I do any other masculine thing, right? 

But there's also other sides to this. First of all, my mom wat part of a male dominated culture(she is part of a male world and is usually respected by other men for doing what she does) This might be tied to my desire to be accepted as one of the boys in my social life. 
My mom does not have much interest in traditionally feminine things, for example she doesn't like fancy clothes or make up or being soft and polite etc. (She was also raised by a single father) There is of course nothing wrong with that, but through her attitude towards these things I saw them as negative when I was younger. It took me very long to allow myself to like wearing dresses for example. 

She was also pretty obnoxious about how me and my sisters bodies develloped(she used the word tits instead of breasts/boobs, in dutch language but this comes close enough to explaining it, and I also remember feeling negatively about getting my first bra from her)

In addition, my relationship with her has always been difficult. She is very dominant over my father in our household, while he is very easygoing and lets himself be commanded and guilt tripped. When reflecting on these things, my mom might be a strong woman, but maybe not a typical feminist. Perhaps she even deals with internalised misogyny herself, but that is not something we talk about.

Outside of the household there is also the music I'm into. I am mainly into metal, and while that community claims to be very tolerant and equalitarian, I find it's not really the case. The majority of women I see in metal are portrayed as lust objects with skimpy outfits and heavy makeup that are a gimmick to a band. The same often goes for girls that are just fans. There is a painful lack of girls in the scene that are seen as artists/fans instead of female artists/female fans if you get what I mean.

Then there is also the entire online meme and game community that I'm into where girls are treated as if they don't exist or are boring so yeah thats not great either.

I really thank you for your comment, because typing this answer has given me a lot of insight in where my feelings originate from. I never came to the conclusion that the environment I live in might not be as feminist as I thougt. There might not be blatant sexism everywhere, but there are still a lot of subtle things under the surface. I also never guessed that some of my negative feelings towards femininity might originate from my moms attitude. This is a whole new perspective for me, and I will certainly explore it further."

2611,"You are a brand-new burner account making top-level comments. We generally don't allow that, regardless of who you say you are."
2612,Fair enough. Thank you for taking the time to clarify.
2613,"I am a cis-woman but have infertility issues, so I’d also be written off. Based on experience, you really need to disclose your want for biological children ASAP. Not everyone wants or can have children."
2614,"It’s not transphobic since you’re treating infertile cisgender women the same way, but I can’t help but think that you’re more so looking for a human incubator than a romantic partner (taking into account that even if their infertility is discovered afterwards, you’d straight up leave them if the treatments don’t work [I’m aware you didn’t explicitly say this but I’m inferring it from your treatment of upfront infertile women]).

edit: When I say “you” I’m not specifically calling OP out. My apologies for that."
2615,"I think that would be such a lame and depressing reason to end a relationship with someone you otherwise love genuinely and deeply. But to each his own, I guess."
2616,"Well I mean if you value none existent kids over a life partner then whatever, you find your baby making machine. Do your thing. Just treat biological women the same as trans women."
2617,"It's not, but only if you avoid trans partners who are actually infertile or where the possibility of having a child isn't possible. You'd actually need to talk to the new or potential partner about your strong desire to have children and can't just write off all trans people as infertile. 

Examples of relationships where it would likely be transphobic, assuming the trans partner wants children: 

- A cis man going out with a trans man who hasn't received any treatment that compromises fertility, and isn't planning to receive any in the medium term. 

- A cis woman going out with a trans woman who hasn't received any treatment that compromises fertility, and isn't planning to receive any in the medium term. 

- A cis man going out with a trans man who has stored eggs, assuming assisted reproductive technology is an option. 

- A cis woman going out with a trans woman who has stored sperm, assuming assisted reproductive technology is an option. 

- Someone going out with a non-binary person who hasn't received or isn't planning to receive any treatment that impacts fertility, assuming they have the right sort of reproductive system and aren't otherwise infertile. 

- Someone going out with a non-binary person who has stored gametes, assuming they're the right sort of gametes and assisted reproductive technology is an option. 

Also, trans people on HRT are not *necessarily* infertile. They're told to assume hormone therapy will make them infertile but they can't assume that. Contraception is still needed if they have the kind of sex where pregnancy is a possibility. Restoring some measure of fertility after HRT is sometimes possible but it's not the sort of thing you'd want to depend on; this is why trans people are encouraged to store gametes. 

It's also worth noting that not everyone is straight and for some LGB+ people a trans partner could give them reproductive options they otherwise might not have."
2618,"No, assuming you also avoid infertile cis women and women who do not want to have biological children. If the bio-kids are the sticking point then obviously you would want someone who shared that desire and was able (or at least was willing to try) to do that."
2619,"We all have dreams. It's not transphobic to not want a partner that is incompatible with a life goal. That said you should definitely be expressing this desire up front with women as some may have fertility issues and some may simply not wish to have spawn. Also, remember there's always adoption. You can adopt or explore surrogacy options. Don't rule out someone that could be a life partner just because you feel it is too different. You could be missing out. :)"
2620,"I mean, no, it’s not transphobic since you’ve specified you would avoid an infertile cis woman as well. Seems kinda sad to me, but that’s a value judgement placed by someone who doesn’t share your particular set of values, so. Technically speaking it’s the fertility potential that you are valuing there, and it doesn’t inherently mean you don’t see a trans woman as a woman- you’re just valuing a future partner based solely on her potential fertility."
2621,"There are so many kids who need homes already. These days it seems like a bad reason to not date a person. It's literally putting the desire to pass on your random biological material above the need of a woman you might love or children who need homes that you could also love

Basically, it sounds selfish

But not transphobic"

2623,[removed]
2624,"I mean. This is something that sort of happens irregardless of gender or sexual orientation.

That you want that in your future."
2625,"Romantic feelings evolved to help us raise families.

Edit: not sure why all the downvotes...that’s just a basic fact. All mammals are evolved to act compassionately/nurturingly/lovingly toward mates and offspring and other kin. 

Reptiles and insects don’t usually have those qualities because they produce dozens, sometimes hundreds of offspring at once which are born with all the skills they’ll need to survive.

The person in OP’s scenario doesn’t care about romantic feelings, considering they’re shutting off transgender women and infertile women for the sake of biological children. There’s no reason why he couldn’t love an infertile woman and adopt, or love a transgender woman and adopt, but he’s not willing to do so. Which, of course, is their choice, but that’s not about acting on romantic feelings. And, to go back to my comment, I see that as more so looking for a surrogate than a romantic partner."

Also, [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/03/feminism-womens-rights-coronavirus-covid19/608302/). (Ignore the headline, it's bait-y.)

It will not, as some folks seem to be hoping, initiate a total societal collapse in which computer dorks rule over harems of desperate, sexually submissive women."
2640,"In my daydreams, it normalizes hair: on legs, on toes, on faces, under arms, on arms, around areolas, dark close to the scalp, unrelaxed, everywhere and in every way it naturally grows on human beings. 

In reality, it will probably just reinforce existing beauty norms as these memes about furry brows and dark roots prompt more women to tweeze and bleach and straighten.

In my daydreams, it reveals to others how critical the caring professions are, so daycare workers will finally get good benefits, teachers will be paid proportionate to their worth, and nurses will be respected as much as doctors.

In reality, it will probably hit them the hardest, with layoffs of childcare workers, shift to more online schooling, and death of many many nurses. 

A tangentially related note: my boss never used to call me outside regular business hours.  We spoke on Saturday morning, had a Zoom meeting from 6:45 to 8 pm Sunday evening, and he called during dinner last night.  9 to 5 was already a thing of the past, but now my kids are at work with me."
2641,"Honestly too soon to tell but there could well be a shift in how society as a whole values the many jobs that are dominated by or typically associated with women. Medical and social care staff, teachers and childcare workers and the older ladies who tend to be the ones running supermarket checkouts (at least where I live)."
2642,From what I’ve observed more feminists are focusing on the working class and resisting racism towards Chinese or “Asian looking” people
2643,"I think a look at history would help. During the 1920s we had the flappers, arguably, the first generation of sexually and financially liberated women. This era ended when the stock market crashed in 1929. Women then needed to marry to secure financial stability, thus giving up some of the freedoms they enjoyed.

The Coronavírus has already dropped the Dow Jones by thousands of points. The economy is taking a huge hit, some economists were expected a recession soon and the corona might have been that catalyst. Realistically speaking, the soonest recovery we can expect is in the summer, due to the virus’s intolerance to heat. With China having a second unique strain of the virus, there is potential that this pandemic can last as long as a year.

With a strained economy, Americans living a single life becomes less and less viable. Thus, many Americans will engage in traditional gender roles to appear as more attractive partners. While the idea of feminism won’t go away, it’s practice is threatened.

Misogynists will say feminism is not economically viable
Extreme religious people will say feminism is wrong and the virus is our punishment.

TL;DR feminism is proportional to economic prosperity.

2644,"It would be good to look at the 2008 recession. I believe it did not have a big of an effect on feminism as the 1930s depression. The 2008 recession had the worst drop point of about 700 points. Lasted 18 months. I believed we recovered from it before feminism felt the effect I predicted.

So far the corona virus is more financially impactful than the 2008 recession. We had a larger lost of jobs, a greater amount of major companies threatening bankruptcy, and a stimulus package being proposed by a Republican government. 

At this point it’s all about how long the corona recession lasts. If it’s gone by the summer, there should be no major negative effect on feminism. But I’m basing this on nothing more than speculation."
2645,"Computer dorks will be the first to go, all their money is in bitcoins and the only weapons they know how to use are hilariously impractical and easily defeated by a can of pepper spray."
2646,"Thanks for this reply. I hadn't consider it. However, do you think the last financial crisis had any effect like this?"
2647,"Oh I love it when men suddenly get “feminist” and “free the nip” /s 

As you’ve stated, the idea is not to force women into different unnatural costuming for appearances. Either to create an unnatural shape of the breast to align with new standards of beauty or to hide the shape/texture or the areola and nipple. The burn the bra movement seeks to liberate women from these constraints. 

But, the idea that your breasts are naturally suppose to sag and hang isn’t anthropological accurate, as you see contraptions (as bras) in societies where women ran/ put extra force on their breasts. Why? Because as you’ve mentioned, it hurts."
2648,"I haven't noticed anti-bra sentiments anywhere. I mean, aside from people working from home saying they're not gonna wear a bra. Where are you seeing this, what are they saying?"
2649,"I think it’s funny because the inventor of the bra was a woman who was fed up with corsets and thought she was creating this liberating invention. She lived long enough to see her own invention be used as a symbol of oppression when that was not at all what she had envisioned. [cracked.com](https://www.cracked.com/article_17186_6-geniuses-who-saw-their-inventions-go-terribly-wrong.html) had a section in an article about it that I thought was interesting. Personally, I don’t like the feeling of going braless, so I don’t."
2650,I'd recommend you reading about the history of the no bra movement and general idea of what it actually is: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.crfashionbook.com/fashion/gmp23601470/no-bra-movement-history/
2651,I think something like burn your heels  would be a better protest.

2653,"Oh and i just re-read your OP and the part about men encouraging this trend stood out more this time. I wanted to address that aspect as well- i think its cool af that male feminists encourage not wearing a bra. But ONLY if its done from a place of understanding (seeing how uncomfortable it is, how fraught and oppressive its history is, and agreement that women deserve the basic right of being comfortable without being judged in daily life) and not from a place of sexualization. Of course we can never know really what someone else's motivations are, but i think if we lobby to change existing legal and social mores to allow women more bodily autonomy, it can only help to de-sexualize breasts, bare or otherwise, in the future, which is (one of) the ultimate goal(s)."
2654,"I am supportive of anti-bra movements. People should have the ability to choose what they do or don't want to do regarding their appearance, and there's been studies that show wearing bras is actually what causes back and shoulder pain, rather than having large breasts is the cause. There's also evidence to support that the use of bras is what causes premature sagging, as it restricts the ability for pectoral muscles to flex naturally. 


Not wearing a bra to school can get you sent home, detention, or expulsion from education. You can get fired from your job and harassed by police for ""indecent exposure"" for not wearing a bra. Bras are being enforced as a cultural necessity while their expenditure is out of pocket, just another form of pink tax, that comes with negative health consequences."
2655,"As a ""bigger than D"", I completely agree with you. Bras are uncomfortable but for some sizes, not having a bra is even worse.

Feminism is about **choice**. Whoever is not pro-choice, is not feminist.

We have to fight for bras not being mandatory, of course! The same way we have to fight for women to not be stay-at-home mums if they don't want to. But if we want to wear a bra or some woman wants to stay at home, well, that's our choice."
2656,Comfort above all else - we can mostly agree that underwires and skinny straps that dig in are the devil.
2657,"Oh my GOD fucking yes it should 100% be a thing!!!! I have Ds too (not sure exact size as ive never worn a bra) and i also have high functioning Aspergers wherein sensory issues are my main problem,mainly with clothes and seatbelts as i CANT STAND feeling ""squeezed"". I hate tight or thick/heavy clothes as i feel i cant breathe and i get SOOO HOT ALL THE TIME.  I wear leggings or athletic shorts or vry stretchy THIN denim, with loose cute tees for casual and flowy nice tops for work etc. Ill wear a cami under to hold tits down frm bouncing too much but that's it. Its literally a health issue for me, albeit mental its still not changeable, but the SHEER AMOUNT OF SHIT ive received over the years since i was 11 (now 30) about not wearing a bra (its inappropriate, its gross,its slutty,blah blah blah fucking spare me) could fill a goddamn book!!! No, a fucking book series! I mean srsly. 

So yeah all women should have a CHOICE to wear or not wear wtf ever;but we SHOULD NOT BE SOCIALIZED THAT ITS 100% NECESSARY TO WEAR THEM, NOR OSTRACIZED FOR NOT DOING SO!!!!  Girls should be allowed to go topless ffs. Im so sick of having to bind and cover our bodies up so as to be both pleasing to men while not ""tempting"" them TOO much. Like FUCK THAT NOISE. Any men, as well as the ridiculous amount of other women, who think they are entitled to police other women's bodies, can fuck right off. 

Sorry if that's too intense a rant lol this is one of my ""passionate"" subjects."
2658,"I mean if you dont want to wear a bra and it doesnt hurt you to not have the support or some other reason ,you shouldnt have to. Bras are really expensive especially if you're a hard to find size. Also Ive never actually seen any feminnists talk about ""bra burning"" other than to make fun of the stereotype."
2659,"As somebody else in this thread said, the fundamental tenet that underpins feminism is choice - the freedom for a woman to choose to do whatever she damn well pleases with her body.

I choose not to wear a bra as I am small chested and don’t particularly care if people can see my nipples through my shirt, they’re just another body part I have. But I don’t judge other women who want or need to wear them. You do you!"
2660,"I’m a G cup and I used to think I needed a bra too, then I started getting issues with my shoulder. I did physical therapy and even considered breast reduction surgery to improve my health, but I didn’t really want surgery and Physio was not helping. Then I was working from home and started foregoing my bra during the day. My shoulder recovered in less that two months after 3 years of issues. It took a few years before I was comfortable to stop wearing them entirely, but even in my conservative office nobody seems to notice/care. I know this is all anecdotal,but I also have found that my breasts have become firmer and higher since forgoing a bra. I understand not everyone is comfortable not wearing a bra, but I believe it is physically healthier to not wear one. Emotional health is real too though, so if you wanna wear a bra for those reasons that is valid."
2661,"I’m feminist as fuck and you will pry my bra off my cold dead tits. I like them, they feel good, and they’re expensive as hell. I don’t think any part of feminism is about telling you what you need to do with your bodies or your clothing."
2662,"If it hurts to walk without a bra you may be in the wrong cup size. Checkout r/abrathatfits  for tips. 

I thought I was a 34 A  but turns out I am a 30DD.   Bras make no sense,  but one thing is for sure,  even though I am a DD  I can definitly go around without a bra. Cup size is just based on the difference in inches of your breast vs underbust. and so even though my breasts are by society considered ""small""   because I have a small rib cage and significant difference between these two measurements I am a DD.  

As for the societal aspect of it,  I do wish we could all accept women for who they are and desexualize nipples and breasts. But I also agree that women should be able to do what they want.   I am someone who just doesnt like showing off a lot of skin so I'm definitly not going to be someone to go topless in the streets even though it is legal where I am."
2663,"My ex has larger than DD breasts and is usually completely braless, at most wearing a bralette when she needs them to not fall out of her outfit or when she needs to look “business professional”. She says it was painful for a bit when she stopped wearing them (years ago) but now it’s only painful when she *does* have to wear them. She did it partly because of how expensive they are. She had a lot of good reasons I’m struggling to remember now, though."
2664,"I actually follow that ideology, to an extent. 

Not a single of the girls I'm friend with me (nor girlfriends) have been able to find bras that were comfortable. At the end of the day, they're all desperate to take off the damn thing. It hurts them, never offers proper support and the inner wire (don't know it's name in English, in Venezuela we call it ""ballena"") always breaks to the fabric and pokes them painfully. 

I'd love for bras to be optional. If someone likes them, feels comfortable with them, go ahead! But I don't like it's a socially mandated article of clothing, because we can't stop looking at women's body like a property or a sexual object. 

So, that's my take."
2665,[removed]
2666,"yes it's weird that male feminists are jumping on it. 

""burn the bra"" had a certain message. back in the 1970s when it was a normal thing to wear layers and layers of sweaty shapewear *every single day* and garments were designed with the assumption you did that, it was a lot more necessary. it wasn't just bras they were burning, they were also throwing in girdles, corsets, hairspray and makeup (all of which are things I also like to wear sometimes ... but I remember seeing a video from the 1950s saying you should do your makeup before giving birth so when your husband is allowed into the room you will be pretty)

spreading the message that nothing bad is going to happen to you from not wearing a bra (i.e. wearing a bra does not make your boobs age any slower ... just like lifting your skin tight with tape everyday will not prevent wrinkles) is still important.

but I don't see ""anti bra"" absolutism around, really. I see ""you don't NEED to wear a bra, it's fine if your boobs don't have a certain shape, it's not the end of the world if your nipple shows"" a lot, but I also see a lot of feminism focused on access to comfort-focused undergarments at an affordable cost & in a diverse range of sizes ... so I don't worry about anti-bra absolutism. I don't actually think it's that much of a thing, it might just be something that's easy for people to ""jump on the bandwagon"" for and something that's very visible because it's part of the old-fashioned stereotype about what feminism is."
2667,"I personally have not seen/experienced this and I know a lot of hippies so it feels like if it were a broader phenomenon-- I would've heard about it a lot more.

Also, although the whole 'burn your bra' concept got really big in 1960s and is considered synonymous with feminists protests today--[it never actually even happened.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45303069)

So my feelings on this are-- if women weren't actually burning their bras en mass in the 1960s, probably there isn't a broad-based resurgence of anti-bra feminists today. Sure, some women do really hate bras and there's even some weird pseudo-science out there that bras are bad for your breasts and make them sag more, but if you want to wear a bra, do your thing."
2668,"I'm all for liberating women from unfair gendered expectations but choosing bras to symbolize them sounds stupid to me because bras serve a purpose and by not wearing them, we reveal an appealing physical feature. Why not burn make up or heels instead? I feel like bare faces would be a lot harder to sexualize than bare boobs."
2669,"I think if a woman hates wearing bras and wants to burn them, that’s fine. However, I disagree that all women should burn bras because some women are more comfortable wearing them, or eases their dysphoria, etc. Wearing a bra or not wearing a bra should be up to each women. Never required or not required. 
Also, strong agree to your thing about guys suddenly being feminist now to “free the nipple.” Many men only want to be feminist only when it benefits them, but that’s not how it works. While men may and often do get benefits from feminism, it should not be that men only support it so they can benefit. Feminism focuses on everyone, not just what benefits you."
2670,"Also, women never actually burned their bras back in the day cause they couldn’t get a permit."
2671,Those on the more radical end of the spectrum of feminism will tell you you *must* burn your bra and you *must* stop shaving. The truth is - do what makes you comfortable and don't trouble yourself with the opinions of others when it comes to you appearances.
2672,I haven’t heard of it. The only place I saw it was in a buzzfeed video.
2673,"I haven’t seen a bunch of “burn your bra” sentiment, so that may just be on a small corner of the Internet. On a personal note, bras are kinda useless to me outside of exercise so I do wish it was more socially acceptable to go without them if one wants and to not have men think their “approval” on the issue is somehow important 🤔"
2674,"I think the original idea behind bra burning is that clothing companies were run by men so it was an industry that could be completely toppled if women didn’t get a say and the right to fair pay. The modern equivalent would be to buy from exclusively women run companies, especially for things like bras and tampons, not to go without a bra"
2675,"the whole free the nipple thing is bs.  as a male i can confidently say that our attraction to breasts is natural, not a learned behaviour.

Edit: Just in case it wasn't clear I mean't that I'm against free the nipple as nipples should be treated as private parts due to there sexually erotic nature."
2676,"There are so many people who want to dictate the way others lead their lives - even feminists. Being outspoken against bras being compulsory is important. But saying that bras are tools of the patriarchy is ridiculous. Trying to force women to not be stay at home wives or forcing them to not wear bras fall in to the same category for me. There should always be the choice to do either and that's the real freedom. It's not about the bra itself, it's about the choice. And I think some people who get into the fight lose that distinction. 

Growing up, Charlie Dimmick on the home improvement show Ground Force was so liberating to see because she was on national tv without a bra doing gardening (a physical job) on a popular day time show. Nipples and boobs should not be so taboo and she was showing that as a real option."
2677,Right? Love how some men are suddenly really on board with feminism as long as they think it means lots of sex and seeing boobs.
2678,"Instagram feminist scene mainly. We have a problem where the biggest account (@feminist) ,which is run by two out of touch men looking for profit, will post something and then all the smaller accounts will repost it or be inspired to post something like it. They recently posted an anti bra post that said “your boobs will look better if you don’t wear a bra”... yeah ew. And now we’ve got a wave of smaller accounts posting anti bra things."
2679,But I like heals 🥺. I am smol
2680,"Well, for a lot of women, the nips are sensitive. Mine straight up hurt if there is anything rubbing against them, even a soft t-shirt. Sometimes it isn't about shame or control or being attractive to the male gaze. Sometimes it's just about comfort. And that shouldn't be tied to oppression and societal shame, by conservative or progressive people."
2681,"Completely agree with this. I have a small set and experience musculoskeletal pain in my chest, so wearing a bra that isn’t barely anything is very painful for me, along with everything else you mentioned regarding oppression on the matter - though the conflict between that and the feeling of talking to others without wearing one and them staring me right in the tits half the time isn’t very fun, either. And my job makes it impossible to go without one, too. 

One of my biggest wishes is for people to reach the point of not sexualizing women’s breasts and their choice whether or not to wear a bra."
2682,As mentioned in another comment-- it's funny how quickly some men decide they're on board with feminism once the potential for seeing some boobs arises.
2683,These are all really great points
2684,">	Bras are uncomfortable but for some sizes, not having a bra is even worse.

I agree with everything you said except for this line. It’s not really about size. There are plenty of people with all shapes and sizes of breasts who hate wearing bras, and others of the same shapes and sizes who hate *not* wearing them."
2685,"I get what you’re saying but the “burn your bra” thing is about actively encouraging all women to not wear bras, as it’s seen as oppressive. It’s not necessarily about choice."
2686,The origins of the term aren’t even true. There were no actual bra burners.
2687,Did it hurt when you walked fast?
2688,Are you a guy?
2689,Don’t donate to Salvation Army but that’s a good idea!
2690,Die mad.
2691,"That’s a simplistic way of putting a phenomenon which could be more meaningful than it seems... In our world of underwired bras and photoshop, men and boys have such a false concept of what breasts look like that it results in disgust and derision at normality.  For some, the appeal of having more normal boobs on view is about being able to see the world as it is, not the false imaginary world of Plato’s ideal forms, so that we can let go of all those silly feelings of lust and temptation which follow from sexuality being portrayed as something sinful and mysterious."
2692,[removed]
2693,"... that one statement is pretty antithetical to feminism and extra gross coming from men.

&#x200B;

please ladies, burn your bras so your breast can better appeal to the male gaze. Wtf?"
2694,Hold up. The feminist account is ran by men?? Not that that’s wrong or anything but what?
2695,I feel like IG may not be the best venue for learning about feminism
2696,"Oh Jesus. Ugh. I mean... wear one, don't wear one, who cares?"
2697,Oof I knew something was off with @feminist
2698,I think the sentiment is that women should not be seen as sluts deserving of rape if they opt out of wearing one.
2699,"Again, personal choice.       
Societal expectations make it murky and complicated (nothing is really a pure choice, everything is influenced by our learning, and sometimes the philosophy behind that influence is on the dodgy side) but at the end of the day you're a human being with a mind and you have got to live your individual life the way you feel driven to do so.        
Not only can you point out the flaws in the system while still being influenced by it, you kind of *have to* - because humans are social learning creatures and it wouldn't be truthful progression to hide from that.       

I kind of feel the opposite about heels though, as a taller woman. To me when I wear heels it freaks some men the fuck out, ""You were like my height before and now you're taller THIS IS WRONG TAKE THEM OFF"". So occasionally wearing heels in my experience is an expression of how smallness/daintiness or lack thereof doesn't define me as a woman - my role is not to protect men's egos, they are not my problem.     

Just keep on examining your beliefs and doing what you need to do."
2700,Yep. Those men aren't femisnists (if they claim to be). They are just assholes in feminists clothing lol (like wolves in sheeps clothing) Idk why men like boobs anyway. They are just fat sacks and are the bane of my existence. Ugh.
2701,"Thank you, it's a huge point of feminism that arose in the 70's  that a lot of people sweep under the rug, even with the science to back it."
2702,"Hmmm i see that i guess. Annnddd....id have to say i agree with that- it IS oppressive and i WOULD encourage it for all women. But perhaps encouraging wouldnt have to mean judging and ostracizing those who chose not to take part? Or would the criticism be implied, you think? 

Idk, maybe a policy makeover is in order- instead of Birn Your Bra, maybe make it ""Only YOU Can Choose How to Clothe Your Tits!"". You know, kinda like ""Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires!""  lol But srsly, maybe we should push a policy of detailing why each choice is often made by certain women, and why each is equally valid, with some new catchy slogan to make the campaign recognizable without long explanation s each time its mentioned?"
2703,"At first maybe, but now not unless I’m close to my  period. Even then I am overall more comfortable throughout the day without a bra."
2704,Yes.
2705,Out.
2706,"Right? I hate the sentiment that women “let themselves go” after marriage. I’m a grown-ass woman, and I’ll wear whatever I like, whether men think it’s “sexy” or not. It’s not my fault that sports bras and granny panties aren’t traditionally considered sexy, because they’re comfy as hell and you can try to pry them from my cold, dead hands."
2707,"But also like, don't have any shapr which could be put on thr 007b gallery of natural but not conventionally pretty boobs. Easier to blame women or put responsibility on them then digest the root of the problem. :/ I'm sure this type of people would laugh or sexualize a FEMEN activist had she refused to wear a shirt. Then, the celebs who choose to go braless  get body- or slut-shamed. Eh, I don't feel we'll get to experience trully body-natural society in our lifetime."
2708,"Yup lol. Two men. I think they’re somewhere in Europe. And yes it is bad because that account was made to generate money, not for feminism."
2709,Unfortunately a really common thing for online power structures of feminist spaces to get taken over by men with agendas.

2711,"It’s not the best venue but there are a lot of good accounts - my feminist collective has an Instagram account for instance and we’re trying to educate our community. 
Larger accounts are often hella problematic and profiting of paid shoutouts and stuff..."
2712,"Maybe not, but it’s probably one of the biggest feminist hubs. I’ve learned pretty much everything from Instagram."
2713,"How is the bra oppressive may I ask?
Personally I think that we need to normalise not wearing a bra just as much as wearing one so that women can truly wear what they like because that’s what feminism is, choice."
2714,....ok
2715,"I genuinely didn’t know that. I don’t agree with all the posts that the feminist account makes but i thought some were pretty good. Also i said it isnt bad mainly because i didnt want to come off as sexist, the fact that they use the account to generate money is bad though. Makes sense now why they repost the same things."
2716,That’s disgusting
2717,Wait what? Where did you learn this from?
2718,What’s ur account? I’ll follow it
2719,"might want to rethink that strategy, just saying."
2720,"I agree with that choice in ALL things is, to me, the goal of feminism so we dont disagree there. But i DO feel bra wearing is oppressive in that it was invented by a man, to make a woman's figure more pleasing  often to the detriment of the women wearing it, ranging from constsnt discomfort to physical pain and injury(its first iterations were corsets, which often damaged a woman's body physically in many ways). Its just another way men invented to control and police our bodies (historically and into modernity, not wearing a bra or corset has been looked down upon and seen as slovenly and slatternly, and women who dont do so get attacked on many levels- moral (its slutty to have tits bouncing or hard nipples visible), appearance (saggy tits are nothing people want to see!),professional (i cant have you working when the customer's wives complain of you not having a bra,is one ive heard personally, and i was in a v loose company tee and cami and pregnant then), and others for something so goddamn trivial). 

So for those reasons, if ""Burn Your Bra""  way the ONLY way to spread the message that not wearing a bra is ok, id MOST DEFINITELY go with it and encourage all women to do so. But given my preference, I'd outline a new campaign that emphasized that wearing a bra is ABSOLUTELY not necessary, nor is NOT wearing one necessary; and that if a woman feels better with ""free boobs"" under tops, going topless in hot weather, and BF her babies uncovered, then that is WONDERFUL and EMPOWERING. But also, if a woman feels better with some support to her boobs (they bounce painfully, or its jusy comfier to her or whatever) and feels safer/more comfortable NEVER going topless or BF exposed, then THAT IS ALSO AWESOME AND 100%VALID AND EMPOWERING AS WELL, because in BOTH scenarios, WOMEN MAKE THE CHOICE. Not societal mores, not fear of social/professional repercussions, etc. Just the individual and her preference. So id title my campaign something like ""Let YOUR Preference Empower You!"" Lol"
2721,I hope I didn't overstep any boundaries. Just thought about giving my two cents.
2722,"Well if you want to bring gender into it, I guess you could say it’s a tad awful that two men are generating a huge amount of money off of a movement they barely even contribute to."
2723,What did they say
2724,"Will send you a DM, ok?"
2725,Why? Is information less valid because it’s on a certain platform?
2726,But why encourage all women not to wear a bra. If it’s a choice it shouldn’t need encouraging. I’m not trying to start an argument but you’re juxtaposing yourself and I’m confused. Should wearing a bra be a choice or be discouraged?
2727,"> But i DO feel bra wearing is oppressive in that it was **invented by a man**, to make a woman's figure more pleasing  often to the detriment of the women wearing it, ranging from constsnt discomfort to physical pain and injury(its first iterations were corsets, which often damaged a woman's body physically in many ways).

2731,I would like to follow your account too!!
2732,"well, 
1) as you've pointed out, one of the most prominent ""sources"" of information about feminism is actually a for-profit account operated by two men-- Instagram is a platform that makes this kind of thing particularly easy to do

2) it's a limited platform, more about images and some language-- it doesn't particularly encourage broader discourse, sourcing or citations, or deep thinking or analysis-- this is a result of the platforms inherent focus on aesthetics and how it is designed. It doesn't mean nothing profound or valid can come of the platform, but it isn't a good primary source of information because of how limited it is.

3) Because of this platform you now seem to mistakenly believe both that bra-burning ever happened, and that there are legitimately modernly feminists out there actively campaigning against bras, which I find a little confusing because you have suggested elsewhere in this thread that the source of this information may not be particularly credible."
2733,"Im sorry if im being unclear, i can jump around a bit without meaning to. What im saying is, i feel like the concept of bra wearing IS an oppressive social construct invented by men as a way to further control women's bodies. I feel bra wearing serves no overreaching benefit that would reinforce the idea that they are ""necessary"". But even though they are NOT necessary, and even though they are uncomfortable for most and unbearable for some (like me), we are socialized (pressured/influenced) from puberty onward to wear one at all times. This has historically been to bind a woman's breasts down and cover them up so that they look pleasing without being ""tempting"" to men- which i feel are DISGUSTING reasons to have to wear an item that is, at the least,  very uncomfortable, on a daily basis, dont you? 

In addition, and to my further disgust, the ATTITUDES around bra wearing are ridiculous. Women who choose not to wear one are insulted, bullied, gossiped about, put down, perceived as being of low morals and/or having bad personal hygiene or style, by men AND women. All of which is RIDICULOUS.

For all of those reasons, I, personally, believe bra wearing is terrible all around. I would be happy if everyone in the world burned their bras tonite. And i absolutely will encourage any woman in my life who wants to stop wearing them to do so. 

However,i do realize that feminism, like everything else in life, isnt about how <I> define it or how <I> wish things were. I accept that centuries of socialization of an idea (like bra wearing) and the attitudes surrounding it cant and absolutely wont be changed in a single day,or even a single decade. I also accept that other people have their own reasons for making or not making certain decisions that vary widely from my own, and i accept that they absolutely have the right to their own thoughts, opinions, and choices. I realize that most women are used to wearing a bra and seeing other females do so from puberty on, and that they may be uncomfortable changing this habit abruptly or at all. 

So given all that, my stance is that even though i personally detest bra wearing, the societal attitudes surrounding it, and the history inherent in it, i can see the opposite POV and the reasoning behind it; and I cant and shouldn't try to force MY POV upon others. If i did that,I'd be the same as the man who invented the corset (imposing his ideal of female bodily confinement/beauty on all women) or the people who judge the women who go braless.

 To sum it up a bit, i guess, i believe that every human being deserves 1.) total bodily autonomy, 2.)the right to think and do whatever they want to without harming others, and 3.) that no human should force our thoughts,ideas, opinions, morals, or bodies on another living being. I believe feminism is simply about A.) bringing awareness to the fact that women often arent given these basic rights- we are constantly having our bodies policed and violated by other people (esp men), we have  morals/opinions mostly created by men shoved upon us and are judged harshly for not conforming to them, etc- and B.) fighting to allow/enforce women gaining and keeping these basic rights. 

Since i dont believe in forcing my POV/way of life onto others, i wouldn't want to put  Burning Your Bra out there as the ONLY or BEST choice- because it isnt the only one, and it may not be best for all, even if it is for ME. I believe that the best way to encite change(in this case, a change in the societal trend of bra wearing and the attitudes around it) is tri-part and is based on 1.) ADEQUATELY INFORMING individuals of all aspects of an issue, 2.) allowing them the freedom to choose their own path once they have ALL the info, and 3.) Validating that in most issues there is more than one valid/correct choice, as well as many individual reasons for taking a chosen path; and that judgement is useless and damaging, while empathy is empowering and productive. 

 So, in this case, I think its just important to establish Burning Your Bra as an OPTION, and one that's equally valid to wearing a bra, since currently and historically women who choose to go braless are looked down upon, harshly judged, and unfairly penalized in all aspects of life. However instead of just pushing one agenda (Burn Your Bra! for everyone), we should attempt to accomplish this change by teaching people the history, facts, attitudes, etc about bras, both positive and negative; encouraging everyone to examine both sides of the issue and make their choice  based on their own needs; and encouraging empathy for people who choose a different path than oneself. 

When i stated earlier that id fully encourage spreading the ""Burn Your Bra"" message if it was the ONLY way to make women aware that its ok to choose to go braless,i simply meant that, if i were given the choice to either continue on with society keeping the same attitudes we've always had about bra wearing,OR to tell women to BYB, i would choose what is (imo) ""the lesser of two evils""  by spreading the BYB ideology. However, i am thankful that we DONT have to choose only one extreme or the other, and would much prefer to affect change thru the methods outlined above. 

Only by education, acceptance of differences, and withholding snap judgement can change be effected. It may be an uphill battle, for sure, but should still be attempted.  

I hope that makes more sense and that i didnt repeat myself too much or sound like too much of a self righteous asshole lol i just tried to sort of organize/outline my ideas and ideals better in order to make sense of my stance."
2734,"Yes you are quite correct, i should have been more clear in that i was referencing the earliest iterations of bras, in the form of corsets or stays, and not the modern bra as we know it, since modern bra wearing was just a continuation of this trend of binding and covering our bodies. However i think it is very notable and wonderful that a woman took us from having to be tightly laced into an organ squishing, breath reducing, rib pinching contraption of thick material and fucking whale bones from armpit to hip, to a simpler, over the shoulder cup-and-band support for breasts. 


And i probably spoke too broadly when stating corsetry was invented originally to control women's bodies. In matter of fact, corsetry has represented many conflicting ideals through history- constriction and freedom, domination and submission, feminity and power. 

Historically, the origin of corseting is a bit contested- some evidence suggests that an image of a Cretan woman, c.1600 b.c., is depicted wearing what is possibly a corset as outerwear, but the origin and validity of that trend at that time is unknown. However, the corset as we commonly know it originated in Italy and was introduced to the French court by Catherine de Medici in the 1300s, and thereafter widely accepted into European society for centuries. Many alterations were made to corsets through the centuries; sometimes it pinched the waist thin, others it allowed a more natural waist; sometimes it exposed the breasts completely and others it covered them completely; sometimes the waist was emphasized, sometimes the bust, sometimes the bottom. All these trends varied based on current fashions. 

However, my comment was based on the fact that generally, men and the male ideals of beauty controlled or were the main influence upon these fashion trends; and corsets were used as a way to quite literally mold and shape a woman's body into a ""desirable"" form; often women ended up deformed by their use. Attitudes surrounding corsetry evolved from being just fashion related to also encompassing certain morals- mainly, that only loose or slatternly women went ""unlaced"", that refusing to wear layers of bindings and coverings made a woman immoral, that lacing one's corset too tightly (to emphasize physical assets) or too loosely (to allow breasts and belly to look natural, i.e. bouncing or protruding or sagging) meant a woman was morally corrupt and trying to seduce unwary men, and on and on.

 Eventually during the turn of the 19th century, women began to resent and reject Victorian restrictions upon their mobility. ""Corset defenders"" gained a powerful new ally in 1907, the well-organized Corset Manufacturers Association. Arguments supporting corset use changed as a result. Manufacturers and retailers instituted new merchandising tactics to resist the ""corsetless evil"" and disseminated pro-corset ideologies culled from dominant discourses about race, nation, and female inferiority. ""Scientific"" methods of corset-fitting blamed discomfort on fit rather than on the garment itself. Transmitted by saleswomen to customers, corset-fitting theories constructed the female body as inherently flawed and in need of corsets to correct ""figure faults."" However, companies produced lighter, flexible ""sports"" and ""dancing"" corsets and marketed the girdle as the modern shaping garment in response to women's desires for more comfort in dress and for clothing geared to their new active public lives. By 1930, the shapely ""womanly"" figure returned to fashion. Corset debates, waged with words and bodies, reveal how the corset works as an instrument of cultural hegemony. U.S. manufacturers and retailers were forced to adapt, but also fought to control fashion changes. (Source: ""Fighting the Corsetless Evil"", Journal of Social History) 

To summarize, corsetry started as a fashion statement and evolved to become a way for men to control and even reshape a woman's figure to his liking, and this construct was heavily reinforced thru false moralizing, body shaming, and social repercussions. When women attempted to rebel from the norm of restricting their bodies, movements, and necessary functions like breathing and digestion, as well as the forced idleness and boredom that came with wearing a corset (as one cant play sports, partake in nature, eat to fulfillment, play with their kids, or do much of anything when covered in thousands of layers of hot skirts/collars/sleeves/underwear while also laced into a metal cage that keeps one from breathing or eating), men frothed at the mouth and called their movement the fucking ""corsetless evil""! And since right around that time is when Industrialism began, manufacturers/ marketers (also all men) jumped on the bandwagon with widespread mass marketing campaigns of body and slut shaming, arguments of female and racial inferiority, and any other bullshit they could pull out of their ass in order to keep women subservient and dependent and keep those profits rolling in. 

For all these reasons and more,i despise any form of bra/corset/etc."

2736,"1. I understand that is the case for larger, corporate accounts. However smaller accounts are extremely vocal and we put a lot of pressure on one another to be as intersectional as possible. Larger accounts never listen because they’re mainly run by bots, but smaller accounts run by people tend to be extremely useful to get information from.

2. Instagram is wonderful for sharing and spreading information, as it’s so easy to screenshot someone else’s post and spread it around. As mentioned before, the smaller accounts are extremely active with one another, meaning it’s very easy to encourage lots of people to spread information. The ability to easily spread information is great, and unlike Twitter it’s not limited to a couple of words.

3. I never said that I believed bra burning was a thing, I simply “should it be a thing”. I’m fully aware that people don’t actually burn their bras, I’m more talking in the sense that should it be a thing and should it be encouraged. That’s the point of the question.

I've also encountered plenty of well-meaning men who do believe in equality and who use the term MRA without being aware of the really awful background of some vocal MRAs and better known MRA groups.

Or when they would rather tell a man in crisis that there are no services available to him and it's feminism's fault to get him mad about feminism than direct him to the very real and useful services that do exist to help men in need.

I will not go looking for a debate against/for MRM, sometimes MRAs try to convince me that feminism is bad, they haven't yet succeeded. I do not have the time or energy to convinced MRAs that their movement is ""bad"". And that is primarily because I do not see every aspect as bad.

In most cases, this would be correct.  However, if a group is going to bill itself and be treated as the major MRM organization but not do anything about laws, doesn't that undermine the whole point about men being denied some rights?  If NOW was saying they won't do anything about laws, just want to give women a 'better vision of themselves' while the founder was, without any kind of degree, charging $150 an hour for 'counseling', I would be really pissed and reject it as an organization representing feminism.

Is it a good idea? Is it right? Both is no. There are plenty of MRM who dislike his tactics. He though is not the whole movement. Why is it fair to paint the MRM like this but not feminism.

And here is my big issue with the MRM.  Most organizations calling themselves MRA groups and most people who are prominent leaders in the movement, the ones invited to speak at conferences, the ones running the big sites, are usually virulently anti-feminist.  Not just feminist-neutral or indifferent, which wouldn't bother me a bit, but outspokenly anti-feminist.  Of course feminists are going to take issue with a group where the main figures are anti-feminist, the same as climate scientists would take issue with a group where the main figures are climate change deniers.  

Don't like that?  Start calling out the ones who make the cornerstone of their activism being anti-feminist.  Want to see constructive dialogue?  Don't give so much of a platform to people who refuse to have civil conversations.  

The feminist movement has been pretty good about not promoting and valorizing female supremacists and separationists.  Yes, some exist, but we're not celebrating them.  

Intersectional feminism is probably the most prominent philosophy in feminism now, and that is not an anti-male philosophy.  Do you see anything anti-male in this quote from bell hooks, one of the most commonly recommended feminists to read?

> To create loving men, we must love males. Loving maleness is different from praising and rewarding males for living up to sexist-defined notions of male identity. Caring about men because of what they do for us is not the same as loving males for simply being. When we love maleness, we extend our love whether males are performing or not. Performance is different from simply being. In patriarchal culture males are not allowed simply to be who they are and to glory in their unique identity. Their value is always determined by what they do. In an anti-patriarchal culture males do not have to prove their value and worth. They know from birth that simply being gives them value, the right to be cherished and loved."

Now, that isn't to say that men don't have issues -- lack of paternity leave, treatment in the criminal justice system, workplace safety, issues of being a victim of violence, mental health issues, the rise in automation, body image, elder care treatment, etc -- are all issues that face men.  I have not seen many of the groups calling themselves MRM/MRA groups do anything about these."

That sounds like a contrived reason to dismiss the fact that *they don't*.

But it's *part* of it. The ""manosphere"" is vast and wide, and includes the internet, writers and academics, politicians, and your average Joe. The MR subreddit is certainly not the only example of it.

I think your point is that we're mistaken about the Men's Rights Movement; that they're not as bad as we think; that actually, they're just fighting for equality too and we should respect that.

Am I wrong?"

I dont think they are the same. Perhaps a better analogy would be along religious lines? 

Still that does answer I think my question. 

I am going to write it as I understand it and please correct me if I am wrong.

You do believe the MRM in their view are for equality but they do not do anything useful to attain it. The biggest problem is being anti feminist which in your view is caused by misinformation and is unfounded in any way.

No point, honestly just asking questions to know why you think what you think. I have no intention or anything of making any argument. I am presenting some arguments when I need to in order to ask a question, or see if you (or others that answer) do see the MRM as fighting for equality and human.

2842,"All feminists are against rape for sure the problem with this situation is that a lot of us are based in the US or Europe and don’t have a link to HK.

I got my information through my best friend who was born there and privately support and speak up in pro protest and pro democracy affairs. 
However: as a white woman it’s not my place to lead a pro HK democracy feminist rally. That’s up to people who understand the situation better and are actually affected by it.

Me and my group of feminists speaking up about it would always come off as the virtue signalling it is (we‘re all European) - we would however gladly and instantaneously join in if another group decided to lead.

Many of my friends went with her feminist groups to pro HK protests and marches when they were in their cities.

So... we do support struggles against police brutality and rape. But a lot of us don’t think it’s our place to lead the movement here and wait for someone from the area to start.  (At least where I’m at) 
Also: western media is a shitshow on this so a lot of people don’t even know."
2843,"I can't tell if you are trying to signal boost this issue or if you want to know why feminist groups are not getting behind this?

If you just want to know why, this is not making the US news (I can only speak to the US, that's where I am at).

I am not dismissive of the HK problems, but I live in South Africa and work in underprivileged communities in Africa... I am a finite being with a limited capacity (as are organisations) for action in the world, the point being I can only focus on the problems I am trying to address here. 

In this all most activists can do is be supportive ""in spirit"" of the HK fight. Maybe write a strongly worded internet post... but what exactly would that accomplish? There is a long history of condemning rape in regions where conflict has escalated, and frankly it does nothing... I speak of rape faced by women in war zones across Africa.

2845,"You may find this article interesting: https://www.thenation.com/article/world/hong-kong-feminism-protests/

Part of the issue is that there isn’t a strong feminist movement in HK now, and given how imperialism has impacted the country negatively, a lot of western feminists are not keen on imposing ideas on them.  Contrary to anti-feminist mythology, we’re not big into imposing our ideas on other communities.  We have plenty of work to do within our own, and trust that the women of HK will be the best ones to lead how feminism is in that country."

Considering most people weren't even aware of this in this thread alone, that would be more evidence towards the fact that we should be speaking out about this? Ofc the HK community is most affected and it should be left as a major talking point for them, but it is not racist to bring this to worldwide attention. This is a major violation of women's rights and that alone is reason enough for our feminist communities to attempt to bring it to mainstream attention. And yes, that can be done through the internet. Start discussions about this rather than stopping them, share this information around. Every feminist will have some prevailing concern over local women's rights violations, but when third world countries' feminist concerns have been all but glossed over by the mainstream political press, it should be any first world feminist's duty to use their privilege to at the very least try and turn attention to it in their own community."

Actual women are getting hurt yet there is nothing but silence"
2854,"Ok here we go: I can understand why this is upsetting for you. The situation in HK is appalling at best, apocalyptic at worst. Police brutality is rampant and the staged suicides are scary. 
My best friend knows people on the front lines and was scared for them a lot during times of more active protests. He himself probably can’t return to China or HK for a while based on the things he said on social media and the fact that he leads a protest group in his current city.

However; western media does not report about it. Many people don’t even know it’s going on. I’ve tried my best to educate my surroundings and lead them towards resources to help them stay on top of the news. That’s all I can do for now.

The thing is: individuals criticising anime figures is not the same as a general talking point. I’ve never seen anyone criticise anime that wasn’t featuring underage girls in hentai btw. It just isn’t a big  and frequent topic in the circles I frequent.
However: feminists do openly and regularly speak up against police brutality everywhere. And you won’t find one that condones systemic rape and brutality as done by HK police. 
But as I said before and as I’ll say again: people in the west are not supposed to lead this. We can join, we can support, we can speak up individually and try to raise awareness. The real protests and movement however has to come from within the community. And we don’t see anything like that yet.
So maybe instead of criticising western feminists you could try and raise awareness in your community and get folks around you to be vocal about it?

Edit: we do deal with harder issues on a regular basis btw. Spousal rape, abortion and sexual harassment being one of them. Feminism in general is not scared of tackling hard issues at all, but we are aware of who’s supposed to speak on a given topic. And this time it’s defo not white women in the west."
2855,"But feminism does speak out against rape as a general principle? 

I didn't know about the specific instance of rape in HK, it is shocking. The threat, and use, of rape as a method of frightening a population into obedience is truly disgusting. I am against it.

But pragmatically speaking, as far as activism goes I cannot fight against the actions of the HK police. Whereas in the context of my own country I can, at least, influence (with support) how women are represented in the media, and how women are perceived in the popular imagination shapes expectations of femininity within society. 

Stories shape how people view each other and ultimately themselves. In this sense the media through which such portrayals are disseminating the ""standard"" narratives around gender. So I wouldn't be to quick to discount an examination of a cultural phenomenon, such critique can do more work in how narratives are recieved and updated which has large implications in the longer term.

Anyway where do you think our ideals of masculinity and femininity come from if not narratives told through various media.

Edit: Look at the Cosplay that occurs in and around geek culture, here is but one example of anime being influential on culture beyond its medium. 

This isn't a dismissal of any concerns about HK and the struggle people face there, but merely an attempt to show you the logic behind a critique of cultural phenomena such as anime. Which while Japanese in origin it has moved into being a feature of the global media industry."

As for the anime complaints maybe its not a thing in your circles  but it is a thing (well in the places i see anyways) and it gets frustrating when i see it because its like they're getting upset over foreign fake drawings but then ignoring real women getting abused in HK? Obviously this doesn't apply to you or people here but it is a frustration i have. Thanks for your responses anyways."
2859,"They’re drawings depicting underaged girls, no one is upset about the ethnicity aspect of anime. They’re upset when they’re used to justify and normalize children being sexualized just because they’re drawings, doesn’t mean it has no affect.

Not only that, anime is still prevalent and exists in big aspects of western civilization. The fucked up shit about HK is that most of us support them, but, as said, it’s not widespread knowledge. It’s not taking place like anime is here, so we’re not comparing similar stuff in this discussion."
2860,"It depends country to country, but the general gist is whilst it's not a standard \~we aren't paid the same annual or hourly salary\~ it's more about over a womans lifetime. Such as:

\- In your mid 20's, you may be (as a woman) passed over for promotions because it's presumed you will be leaving the role on maternity leave shortly.   
\- If you're established in your career, taking time off for maternity leave or general parental duties isn't received as well as men taking the exact same leave. This is something that occurs socially within companies, and would rarely be outright expressed from higher ups (yet is still revealed as a general prejudice after the fact).   
\- There are still a lot of stereotypes regarding women in the workforce. Such as a female figure of authority within a job being ""bossy"" or ""bitchy"" rather than just being a boss, or having leadership etc etc. This also comes into play when people are put forward for promotions.   
\- The above things are even worse when it comes into stereotypes regarding non white women. Ultimately whilst it's illegal to explicitly pay someone less $, if you're a woman, and then also not a white woman, all of the social stigma attached to your identity come into force with job offers and promotions etc.   


Disclaimer: this is all stuff from the top of my head from having this convo with friends over the years. Feel free to fact check me, but if you google things like ""why is there still a wage gap"" you'll get a lot more detailed answers outlining what i've put above.   


TL;DR- It comes from social conditioning and isn't explicit. But there's still a lot of research backing it up as a genuine Thing TM"
2861,"To add to these awesome comments, I remember someone else mentioning bonuses on a similar post and wanted to put it here. Bonuses aren't included in a base salary and the employer can literally make the bonus whatever they want and it doesn't have to be equal so men can make more by getting bigger bonuses than women.

I have also read about instances of management just literally creating a position that didn't exist before just so they could give a man more pay by putting him in this new position that didn't exist before that guy appeared that also just happens to promote him above his female coworkers.

Let's also remember that just because something is illegal doesn't mean nobody does it. People are dissuaded from talking about how much they make which makes it harder to know if you are being paid the same. This means employers can get away with paying women less and no one even knows. Even in a situation where that does come out, the employee would have to sue to ""prove"" discrimination which takes a whole tone of money and time and most people don't have the luxury to go through with it."
2862,"Thank you so much, that makes a lot of sense! I knew that it was a genuine thing still and that women didn't get paid as much over their lifetime but I didn't know exactly why or understand it. Thank you for clearing it up :)"
2863,"To add sorry! A lot of it also comes from the way women (as students, or also general social behaviours) aren't taught to negotiate and fight for their rights. [It's often found women aren't socialised to demand higher pay alongside career progression in the same way men are.](https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2018/05/new-research-promotion-gap) Also because most large-scale companies are a bit of an Old Boys Club, and men are shown to promote men (and women typically promote women), the general promotion of women just doesn't happen. Basically it's a combination of upfront discrimination, social stereotypes and misogyny that are inherent to most of the workforce, as well as a lifetime of opportunities that simply aren't provided to women."
2864,"Oh wow, I didn't know that they could do that. Perfectly legal, too. :( 
I've heard about the last bit before, and it makes me so upset. It happened to my mother when I was younger even though it was supposed to not be allowed."
2865,"I’d also like to add in, while it doesn’t explicitly talk about the pay-gap in terms of “same job, same status, different pay”— I do think it’s worth mentioning that the jobs looked at as traditionally “feminine” have an issue here as well. 

Not only are they usually considered the “unimportant” jobs, the fields women dominate are usually paid pretty crappy.

Things such as -

* Teaching (29k) [BA & TC]

* Speech Pathologists (77k) [BA & TC] 

* Childcare Workers (23k) [Entry/ASSO]

* Nursing (60k) [BA]

* Dental Hygienists (70k) [ASSO]

* Secretaries (38k) [Entry/ADDITIONAL GETS YOU HIRED]

While male dominated careers...

* Coach (50k) [BA]

* Financial Analyst (80k) [BA]

* Firefighters (45k) [Entry/EMT CERT]

* Management Analyst (62k) [BA]

* Construction Worker (36k) [Entry]

* Carpenter (47k) [CARP CERT]


A lot of these jobs are taken for granted, like teaching, firefighting, and nursing — but I’m not here to talk about how these jobs deserve better. I do, however, want to look at why even entry level fields dominated by men are getting much more than those dominated by women. Why are jobs that are more intensive and more pivotal to our society getting thousands less a year than others?

You need a BA and teaching cert to be a teacher, yet still average less than a construction worker that’s typically entry-level? Financial analysts & Management analysts make 80k a year while nursing makes 60k? 

We value women’s labour less. Hell, SAHMs are so undervalued they’re not being compensated in any light for 24/7 work and are often treated incompetent if not perfect— and are often doing the labour for 4 or 5 different professions. They work for housing, food, clothing, etc... yet are often treated like lazy non-working people if they couldn’t get dinner on the table or finish the dishes because she was already out all day doing a parent teacher conference for Timmy, picking up the dry cleaning, sending checks off to make sure the rent got paid, scheduling doctor appointments, doing the laundry, etc. I shit you not, most people truly think that men who work should only be responsible for going to work and bringing home paychecks, and expect the SAHM to mother not only the children, but him as well— all while taking care of the family needs of food shopping, cleaning, managing their life. That’s so undervalued that “respect” is not even factored into their payment.

So on top of the genuine pay gap where data shows men getting paid more for even the same jobs, title, and certs— female dominated fields and roles are often valued less overall."
2866,"[Women ask for raises as often as men, but are less likely to get them.](https://hbr.org/2018/06/research-women-ask-for-raises-as-often-as-men-but-are-less-likely-to-get-them)


>One common explanation is that women are less likely to negotiate their salaries. The bottom line of our study is that women do “ask” just as often as men. They just don’t “get.”




>The research suggested that women lose money if they don’t ask for a higher salary, but may actually hurt their careers if they do ask. "
2867,That's really depressing
2868,I totally understand that. This was really interesting and well put.
2869,You'd have better luck going to the r/askwomen subreddit as I've seen this asked many times there with lots of answers being shared.
