1,Stop spamming this subreddit
2,Here's a news article about it if you don't want to read some random blogger's hot take: https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/amazon-alexa-siri-sexist-un-women-ai-gender-stereotypes-a8924581.html
3,"I’m going to copy and paste what I commented on all the other posts you’ve been spamming across every possible subreddit:

Bredesen protocol is unproven. He has tons of case studies, but has not performed a blinded, placebo controlled trial.

It’s very irresponsible for you to say people are “reversing” or “preventing” Alzheimer’s with the Bredesen protocol.

There are certainly steps you can take to decrease your risk for Alzheimer’s: healthy diet, controlling blood pressure, maintaining healthy weight. Also, ApoE4 risk allele increases your risk for Alzheimer’s, does not automatically mean you will get it.

6,It's an interesting question about male and female ratios. An interesting point involves the barriers that women face in the stand up scene. To become successful requires comics to attend about 3 events a week when they are starting out.  As a woman when you travel across town and then attend events alone you are putting yourself at risk. I speak as a female comic. To travel across the city alone and then stand alone in a bar - this is a risk that I don't think men appreciate. I am a confident woman but it takes a lot of mental effort to do stand up. Can you imagine how much harder that is when you have to deal with patriarchal bullshit? Wasn't there a female comic murdered in Australia coming home from a gig recently? Yeah - that...
7,"The ratio of successful men to successful women in comedy has little bearing on any gender being funnier. As /u/Bigger_Than_Others pointed out, there are way too many variables that go into making someone ""successful"" that you aren't accounting for. 

>Men's jokes can be pretty mean in the work environment but you have to throw it back at them without pissing them off.

Let's look at this from other angles:

1.) ""Pretty mean"" jokes are totally unprofessional, decrease morale, contribute to a hostile work environment, and can be avoided altogether by people fulfilling their responsibilities as adults and choosing not to make them.

2.) According to the cognitive model (situation > thought > emotion > behavior), each person is responsible for their own reactions. Someone choosing to bite back at a ""pretty mean"" joke has failed in their responsibility to act professionally, but they have no obligation to manage anyone else's emotions. 

From your comment, I suggest you try bettering yourself by improving your ability to think through situations and their potential outcomes and also work on your reasoning skills because both are woefully inadequate here."
8,"You didn't even bother listening to the source provided. You posted this four minutes and ten seconds after it was posted and the actual show is thirty five minutes forty seconds long.  
If you would have taken the time to frame things in the actual discussion that's happening, instead of just blabbering your boorish, intellectually inelastic, based-on-nothing, downtalking, selfish opinions... you would have been able to talk about the study that sparked the conversation. Which I'll sum up for you (again!) real quick as ""we gave a man and a woman the same presentation, one with jokes and one without jokes, and people perceived the funny man in this glowing and positive way that enhanced his professional standing, and the funny woman in this very different negative way that diminished her ability and intellect, despite the content and context being exactly the same"". All of which had absolutely nil to do with professional comedic success statistics, or ""how to handle men making inane jokes in the workplace"" so there's really no point in telling us wimmenz how to \~deal with it\~.   
But also, by the way, the proper answer to how to deal with it is to just say ""that was a bad joke, and you're not funny"" and walk away, and to go and be funny with the women who are *actually* funny. Duh."

23,So no criticisms then? Maybe address these [questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/901crk/what_is_the_alternative_to_thinking_about/e2oc3x6/).
24,"First of all, I'm sorry this happened to you. It's great you're willing to talk about it.

Have you considered seeing a therapist? It's someone you can talk to without worrying about being judged, or being unsupportive.

In terms of talking to your friends, that's what friends are for. It's not the same as talking about a movie you want to see, but an important part of a friend relationship is discussing things that are serious about your lives.

And I don't really have advice about dealing with criticism for abstaining, but you are able to choose what you do and don't want to do. "
25,"I'm sorry that you've been sexually assaulted, and that you've had to go through it alone. That's a really tough road to travel. Let's see if we can help you unpack and sort through some of it, okay?

1.) I don't think there can be a realistic expectation or odds of being assaulted/meeting a terrible person. We're operating on the individual level here, not stepping back and looking at a whole population. It could be that there are more shitbags who are willing to hurt other people to get what they want in your area than is typical or something, so averages aren't very helpful. Odds don't factor in the characteristics of the predators, either—some are really good at hiding in plain sight. The best I could give you is anecdotal evidence based on my own experience, and that's incredibly not-useful. 

2.) I understand what it's like to feel like you can't discuss something as serious as a sexual assault with the people around you, so the first thing I want you to know is that it's okay. You don't have an obligation to. 

I think that if your closest friend is always very supportive of you and if you love and trust each other a lot, she wouldn't be like, ""Shit, you think *that's* bad? I'll tell you what bad is!"" or anything. The pain of her own experience is a different issue, though. I know that I would walk through the fires of a thousand hells for some of my friends, but I wouldn't want to put them through that for me. How has she been doing since her assault? Would you be okay with asking her if she would be willing to lend an ear for this before discussing what happened to you and giving her a few days to decide, and time to prepare herself for it if she says yes?

As for your other friends, consider how much you trust them to listen, empathize, not tell you it was your fault, and basically just treat you well. In my mind, that should be your deciding factor. People have good times and bad times; good friends understand that and they want to help you through your bad times as much as they want to be with you to celebrate good times. If you're not sure you can count on them the way you need to, it's okay to decide not to bring this up right now.

Have you considered contacting a crisis warmline/help line? In a way, that's what this thread is like, except calling an actual crisis line puts you in touch with people who have definitely been through training; you're less likely to get that here. I can try my best to be helpful, but I still haven't been taught how to help someone in a way that's most likely to be useful—it would be easy for me to miss laying out some options that exist because I just don't know about them.

Lastly, your sexual preferences are *yours* and you have a right to them. People giving you shit about it is like feminists who talk bad about women who choose to be housewives. It's not right for them to try to make your choices for you; feminism and sex-positivism are about encouraging and increasing choice, not dictating a path that happens to be different from more conservative options. We're supposed to be more accepting, not just a different kind of hypocritical fascist. (I'm pretty sick of that shit, can you tell?)

As for your psychiatrist being judgmental/having a block about your abstinence, you might ask him if his opinion would change if you engaged in your chosen sex acts because those were the only ones you enjoyed. If his attitude would be different, it sounds more like his problem than yours—nothing would change about the kinds of sex you were having except for his judgment of it. 

Anyhow, if none of these options work out for you, or if I've missed addressing something, please don't hesitate to shoot me a PM to unload. Sometimes it's easier to talk with someone you're not invested in, and one you know you won't encounter irl. <3"
26,"Hi,

I'm really sorry about your experience, it's something that no one should ever have to endure.  I relate so much to the circumstances surrounding your assault, and I commend you on your courage to post about it. 

I too began to come to terms with my own sexual assault, which occurred two years ago and also on my first tinder date (creepy coincidence). I completely empathize with your apprehension about telling a friend who went through something""worse"". But what I learned from sharing my experience is that sexual assault is not black or white, more like a spectrum of traumatic experiences that cannot be neatly defined. While that makes it difficult at times to process and compartmentalize  your experience, it may also help you feel less self conscious about telling your friend, because like I said there is no right or wrong way to be assaulted. Ideally, your friend will understand you and be a source of validation and support. I hope this helped you a little bit.

Continue to heal and prosper ❤️"
27,"Hi.  Thanks so much for responding to me.  I think that makes you the first person I've talked to about this.  Thanks for listening :)

I am seeing a therapist but haven't mentioned it to him yet.  I'm afraid he'll criticize my abstinence.  He always talks about it as if it's bizarre and inadvisable."
28,"Oh my gosh.  Thank you so much for this.  I waited a couple of days to respond just to give it some thought.

1) is so true, and I think that's what frustrates/scares me.  There's no real way to know.  

I talked to my friend this past week and she was insanely supportive- it's just like you said; she explained that the pain of her experience felt different than talking about mine with me, and that she didn't see talking about my experience as bringing up her trauma.  She didn't feel an emotional connection between those two things, is what I mean.  I feel sooo much better.  I didn't realize just saying it out loud would make me feel better.  I kind of thought it would make it worse.

I hadn't thought of calling a help line.  I feel like because it's been so long, and I don't feel... traumatized enough?  Like I feel like I'd be making a mountain out of a molehill?  I don't know.  Do you think there's anything they could still do?  I don't want to be taking up resources from people who are actively experiencing crisis, you know?

>feminism and sex-positivism are about encouraging and increasing choice, not dictating a path that happens to be different from more conservative options. We're supposed to be more accepting, not just a different kind of hypocritical fascist. (I'm pretty sick of that shit, can you tell?)

Me too.  So much, me too.  Thank you for saying this; sometimes I just need to hear someone confirm I'm not crazy.

Just thank you.  Thank you for taking the time to write that out, thank you for caring even though I'm a stranger, thank you for making me feel less alone <3

"
29,"You're welcome! It's unfortunate, but I'm glad I can help.

I don't know your relationship with your therapist overall, but *this* aspect doesn't seem healthy. I didn't fit well with the first therapist I talked to. And that's ok. It's perfectly fine to not have a longterm therapy relationship with the first therapist you find.

And I would really recommend talking to friends too. If they're your friends, then they want you to deal with things bothering you. Just because other people have problems doesn't mean you don't."
30,"Thanks.  Unfortunately, I'm stuck with this therapist.  He's actually a psychiatrist- an excellent one- and I need him to handle my very complex psychopharmacology.  Additionally, later in my career, I will have to sign over all of my medical records and notes, HIPAA protected or not, to a licensing board.  Mental health treatment will disqualify me from practicing my profession.

My psychiatrist is indispensable because he has experience navigating that issue and takes few if any paper records."
31,"Well that's a shitty situation. Can you talk to him about how he talks about it? If you're thinking about it, you should be able to talk about it."
32,"You have an hour glass figure judging by your measurements but that's not really my concern.  My concern is that you seem to be placing your self worth on your appearance and that saddens me.  Who cares if you're ""pretty""? There is no accomplishment in ""pretty"". Strive to be successful, intelligent, informed, creative, compassionate.. 

Being a woman should not be defined by how feminine you are.  There are plenty of masculine women and feminine men.  Don't compress yourself into a gender role.  If you act as yourself and you see yourself as a woman then that's enough.  That is all you need.  Not all women are born with an hour glass figure, hips, breasts, or even female genitalia but having or not having any of those things makes them no less of a woman than any other.  "
33,"I'm a trans woman, so I know what it's like to feel betrayed by your body. Just know that you're valuable as a person and that looks are secondary to things like having an open heart and being kind to people.

I'm pitiful on fashion advice, so that's about all I can add. Much love."
34,"All my love to you and please know I have been there.  Many of us have.  We get compared to other women so often that we start doing it to ourselves, it starts to feel natural.  

You are a woman, you're a real and beautiful woman.  All those descriptors are arbitrary.  Hourglass, pear, whatever, they all reduce our complex body into something to be evaluated and dissected.  I remember someone telling me I was pear shaped in high school and it stuck with me negatively for years.  Later I realized that it was said out of jealousy and out of her own insecurity.  And even if it had been true, well fuck it!  I can run for miles and lift 100 lbs and have great sex and see beautiful art.  I make myself better every day.  What more can I ask from my body!  

It's a tall order to say ""love yourself"" as a teenager in our culture.  So, just do what you can.  If you can be kind to yourself, give that a shot.  Think about what you would say to your best friend-- you yourself deserve no less.  If you're having trouble being kind to yourself, try to bring some kindness to *that*.  Any place you can put kindness will benefit.

You are always welcome to pm me.  ❤️"
35,"The view points that make a TERF a TERF are ones that seek to exclude trans women from women's spaces.  No matter how good a TERFs mental gymnastics are, holding these views makes you transphobic and a transmisogynist.

If their plan is not to exclude trans women, then they are probably not trans exclusionary radical feminists."
36,"""Exclusionary"". If it excludes any group of women, then it shouldn't be considered feminism. "
37,"Perhaps it's because I transitioned a while back and see people rationalizing not transitioning all the time while the pain builds up for years and years, but my feelings about this piece are pretty complicated. I can of course relate to the pain she describes, especially that of childhood, but two things concern me and I feel need some response.

1. I can't help viewing her decision not to transition as comparable to a diabetic refusing insulin or a melanoma patient refusing to remove cancerous spots: it's her right to pass up the medical treatment that can ameliorate her condition, of course, but it's not exactly a risk-free choice, and I think it's important to be aware that what she's doing does involve suffering needless pain, for whatever reason. I know ... many, many people who made her choice only to transition a decade or two later when the cost of not transitioning mounted and consumed their lives and their peace of mind. It is her right, just as anyone can refuse life saving healthcare, but it isn't something I'd recommend any trans person try. 

2. I don't think I'd give her a pass for essentially identifying socially with sexist men to offer up Not All Men viewpoints. The fact that she knows she's supposed to be female doesn't mean that she can hold any point of view she wants and have it be treated with an unearned respect. In general, I don't feel compelled to genuflect to anyone's internalized sexism; if it would seem ignorant or offensive coming from a cis woman (and I've heard plenty of unreconstructed sexism from cis women), I can't see why it's any more fine from a closeted trans woman. 

This may seem harsh, but I've been thinking about her article for a while, and while there were parts that made me hurt for her--my childhood had its own comparable pains--I do think a bit of corrective perspective needed to be offered."
38,"This is a great piece, thank you for sharing it! I appreciate getting called out when I need to approach an issue with more nuance than I've given it before. If I could, I'd send the writer a dozen sheets of Lisa Frank stickers and some really cute and comfortable pajamas as a thank you. 

This internet thing is such a double-edged knife: on the one hand, there are a ton of people out there who post really shitty things to folks they don't know just because they can; on the other, I'm 100% sure that if I'd sat down and listened to the author say all of this to my face from within her boy-suit, my feelings about it would be different (maybe not by a lot, but they *would* be different), and I'm grateful that I got to take this in without my own bullshit preconceptions getting in the way. It's good to have your blind spots pointed out so that you can make the effort to eliminate them. "
39,">  It is her right, just as anyone can refuse life saving healthcare, but it isn't something I'd recommend any trans person try.

Yeah, it broke my heart to read that the cost to herself would outweigh the benefit. It felt too similar to a gay person being corralled into a life-long conversion program and accepting that as the best solution, even though it's an undeniably shitty one. 

> I don't think I'd give her a pass for essentially identifying socially with sexist men to offer up Not All Men viewpoints. 

I think that's a totally fair statement to make in general (and I don't think your saying it was harsh). When I first read the Not All Men section, I bristled. :) (Seriously, the number of times I'd actually mean ""all men in the entire world, bar none"" is zero, I'm just not going to spend time listing all the cases in which a statement wouldn't apply to someone. What, next I'm going to say, ""Oh, but not you. You're one of the good ones!"" to someone? \**shudder*\*) 

The overall idea that I took from her post was that it's not good to make generalizations about people. It's not kind, they deserve better than that, and we can *do* better. It's totally unacceptable to stereotype lots of different types of people whether or not the characteristics are visible (like racial groups, those with visible or non-visible disabilities, people suffering from mental health issues, financial status, etc.)—and we should extend that treatment to all people, even those we might look at and immediately think, ""Heh... neckbeard"" about. Yes, they could easily change their appearances to avoid the stereotype, but should they need to do that just to have someone else *not* assume they're dweebs? Part of me is like, ""No, that's my baggage, not theirs. I would never say that someone who looks like a man couldn't actually be a trans woman, and I shouldn't assume that everyone who has gross facial hair is a neckbeard,"" and part of me is still like, ""Right. ...But white-knighting, Cheeto-dust-licking, fedora-tipping neckbeards!"" I think that regardless of where I eventually come down on this, it was good for me to get the reminder that even though there are still groups of people that it's socially acceptable to discriminate against, to do so is unfair. It's a person's behavior that tells us the truth, not their outermost characteristics. 

> The fact that she knows she's supposed to be female doesn't mean that she can hold any point of view she wants and have it be treated with an unearned respect.

Yes, but. (I apologize for using one of the most annoying openers possible.) To me, she's an expert on her own experiences who's asking for a place at the table but not  demanding to be the driving force of conversation at it. Someone quietly saying, ""Hey, I'm here, too"" after not being recognized for an hour. What you say is fair (and ""fair"" is the highest standard I hold people to), but I don't think it's mutually exclusive with what she's said. I think I'm interpreting what she wrote differently is all, and it seems like it's still compatible with what you're saying."
40,"I don't disagree. At the same time, I've found that frankly sexist viewpoints are fairly common among pretransition trans women and a lot rarer among those who actually have experienced not merely what it's like to live as a woman but also the harsh shift in treatment which underlines just how sexist the world still is. I was keenly aware before transition of how much extra BS my girl friends had to deal with, but it was still a plunge into ice cold water. 

A man called me beautiful the other day without getting in my face or expecting a reaction, just said it while walking by and hurried along to give me my space, and I was stunned by how much relief I felt that he didn't make things scary and just gave me a compliment without trying to take anything from me, including my attention. It underlined for me just how much my ambient atmosphere has changed and how guarded I always am now under a smiling, conventionally pleasant exterior. 

I'm not dismissing her experiences, but maybe I am just a bit jaded and think that if she transitioned she'd rapidly change some positions and probably grow as a person in ways she doesn't expect. 

To your primary point about not judging or dismissing others, I generally agree. I've heard brilliant analyses of sexism and social dynamics from men, things I simply didn't realize despite years of pretending to be one; and from some people who happen to be men, I've heard solutions more pragmatic, respectful, and fundamentally feminist than anything I've read in theory books or professional commentary. I've also learned a lot by reading what post-transition trans men have to say; it can be eye opening in ways that expose blind spots. And identities are no predictor of valuable contributions. 

So with that, I do agree, absolutely."
41,"> I'm not dismissing her experiences, but maybe I am just a bit jaded and think that if she transitioned she'd rapidly change some positions and probably grow as a person in ways she doesn't expect.

Yeah, I'm with you for sure. I wouldn't presume to know what's best for someone else, but I sure as hell do question whether her cost-benefit analysis is badly skewed from the heavy toll gender dysphoria has taken on her. "
42,"The cynic in me believes that in a few years, as time and testosterone further virilize her body, as people she knows transition and move happily on with their lives without the sky falling on their heads, that cost benefit analysis is likely to change.

That hurts to think about. I hope she is very honest with herself. I remember when I was running from the treatment for my condition desperately; I don't wish it on her, and I hope she has the strength to survive."

Almost every single white person I knew at the time marveled at how everybody came together. They weren't on the receiving end of the bullshit PoC got. Hours after the towers went down, my best friend (American born, first generation, of Indian descent) was working his retail job and bumped into a display, knocking some of the items off the table. This venomous customer who was in the store at the time said to him, ""What, two towers weren't enough for you?"" as if he were ""one of them""--some terrorist, definitely not an American, hadn't spent half his childhood growing up in Queens, and hadn't had his heart ripped out when he saw what those maniacs did along with the rest of us. 

For months after, he'd get followed through parking lots to his car, cut off in traffic, and generally harassed by fuckwits. It mostly stopped when he stuck a newspaper insert of an American flag in his car's rear windshield, like the drivers around him thought to themselves, ""Oh, okay. I guess he's one of the good ones. I'll let him go this time."" 

But all you saw around you were American flags on cars and ""United We Stand"" and ""These Colors Don't Run"" bumper stickers. Really? Really?? He saw a bumper sticker once that said ""United Whites Stand."" I saw a mural on a wall of an eagle crying that said ""Divided We Fall."" Different America for different people."

82,"Before anything, I'd just like to say that I welcome criticism of my analysis of this article:

""recent alliance Bush and the Feminist Majority"" ... if anything should alert you to the fact that her analysis lacks critical insight into the multifaceted-ness of feminism (and of women's issues and organizations in America), it's that phrase. There is a feminist majority in America? Is... is she joking? Our nation is *overrun* by reactionaries! Using the word ""Feminist"" almost pejoratively, ignoring completely that feminism has a multitude of meanings and has changed so dramatically in width and scope since the (lol) Victorian Era... this is rich. Don't get me wrong, I too feel that the United States has no business being in Afghanistan - but then that argument should have been made all the way back in 1980, and right to Charlie Wilson's ugly face. (Not to suggest that the Soviets had any business dropping cluster bombs on Afghanistan). 

As an Indian myself, I find it particularly amusing that uses the example of sati. This is such a tricky subject to deal with and you never want to cross the line into that ""White Savior"" narrative, which is troubling, patronizing, and imperialistic. But at what point does warning against imperialistic patronization yield to sheer apology for abuse? The conditions faced by women (from Afghanistan to America to India to Britain) are oppressive and demeaning wherever you look. Indeed it is up to people within these societies to find their own narrative, their own way of finding a way to speak out against reactionary traditions and disrupt them. My experience in India has often been very disappointing - in the quest for denouncing imperialism, the narrative suddenly becomes nationalistic, reactionary, and downright fascistic - a wholesale denunciation of everything Western, to where the government prevents O.P. Nayyar from writing a saxophone melody for a film lest we Indians should fall prey to that ""vile Western propaganda and lecherous jazz music"" or where some two-cent politician in Kolkata suggests banning Shakespeare and replacing it with only Bengali literature or Bengali translations of selected ""safe"" works. Funny that she should mention clothing. In the patriarchal society that is India, the suggestion that a girl who was raped should not be shamed for the type of clothing she was wearing got quite a few frustrated head shakes and some isolated laughter and chuckling when I mentioned it at a family reunion in 2012. Back at the airport the security guard after the customs post was getting chummy with me, and then asked me if I had a white girlfriend in America, and if she's a firebrand in bed like Hollywood suggests they all are. When I came back I told a family friend that the harmonium (musical instrument which has become a staple of many Indian musical genres, especially Indian classical) she plays actually originates in France. She refused to believe me.

**THAT BEING SAID, this article does hit on some great points**. One of the commenters said it best:
> Of course the people invoking the suffering of women and LGBT people to justify war in foreign lands are active members in pro-feminist and pro-LGBT rights groups in their own countries and are equally concerned about how women and non-heterosexuals are treated in their home communities. You'd be right to be skeptical. Politics shows similar trends. Politicians that have never supported women's or LGBT rights, or even actively worked against them, suddenly discover their inner egalitarian when promoting a war.

Indeed many self proclaimed ""feminists"" in America tout a liberal-democratic perspective on world issues which ignores completely the complicity of American political intrigue, economic power play, and military browbeating in helping create conditions in the Middle East (and the rest of the entire world for that matter) that are hostile to women (as well as men), and LGBT, etc, and - for what its worth - *bankrolling the very same reactionary fundamentalist groups and individuals*  that they see fit to suddenly criticize.

But, more than anything else, the thing about articles such as this, to me, is they never seem to suggest any corrective course of action, because I still believe that oppression, worldwide, wherever you are is a real thing, whether its the exploitation of a woman's productive labor by some boss, or the exploitation of her reproductive labor. INDEED, in a power dynamic where one member or party has significantly less power than another, simply the presence of consent from the less powerful half cannot be enough to justify an action. Authors such as this one seem tenuously to focus on the presence of consent given by Afghan women to wearing the burqa as ultimate justification for said act - is that simply the end of the story?

[Here's a great article about the presence of consent in a society where sex is a gendered act and power is skewed towards men](http://anti-imperialism.com/2015/07/06/lets-talk-about-consent/)

83,"I really enjoyed your commentary.

I brushed over the seemingly monolithic description of feminism (but saw the clarification) and didn't question. Should've made my radar go off.

Also, I've never heard of the anti-Western separatism going on in India. Thanks for the examples. There's still such a bad white savior complex in the US specifically when people around me talk about 'backwardness.'

Your comment on consent is a really important philosophical canon of feminism. Some oppressors seek autonomy to crush it, some deny the idea that the oppressed could consent or have agency, and some rely on what presents itself as consent but is actually a power struggle. I think Karen James writes on that a lot.

I'll check the article when I have time."

89,"I don't think reporting as spam is a productive approach, even granting that the post is factually wrong. It's certainly not going to do anything, and it implies a willingness to fight over the mechanics of the conversation than the subject. There may be a time when not acknowledging intersectionality is participating in bad faith, but sadly, that's not today.

Apart from that, ""disrespectful"" is a kind of odd claim to make, given the way that [white suffragettes were disrespectful of other races voting](http://the-toast.net/2014/04/21/suffragettes-sucked-white-supremacy-womens-rights/)."
90,"I felt the exact same way about this. On the one hand, this was still a remarkable day that needs to be recognized and celebrated, on the other hand, saying ""women's equality day"" when referring to a day that only symbolizes equality for a very specific demographic of women kind of suggests that only the battles that white women face or experience are relevant. 

At the same time, however, if we celebrated the lives and achievements of both women and minorities (and especially women that are racial or other minorities) more often (or a at all), there would not be so much pressure for single movements to be intersectional, becayse culture itself would be more diverse and intersectional.

Also something that I think it important, is that we need to recognize these days for both what was gained and NOT gained. We need to celebrate these days but also identify the fact that only white women got the right the vote, and that women of colour were still struggling. And that this, in turn, is something we still see today and that we have to be aware of things like white privilege and racism when understanding the inequalities women face. 

Maybe these types of cultural movements should be both a celebratory thing as well as a teaching moment?"

But anwyays ...yea.... sometimes I just get so tired of explanating things.
I don't think it's disrespectful at all. I think it's disrespectful that I didnt know that this only pertained to  white women until I was 26. I deserved a better education then that. We all do. It's disrespectful that we don't even learn about woman's rights until college and then when we do, it's usually white washed. Arfhggfgdndufdndjdggghf the anger. Sorry I don't have any truth bombs for you to discuss with your friend. Just ranting now 

Edit: I guess it says all lives matter at the bottom  so ew but I still kinda like the picture. 

Also, mentioning that this is the anniversary that white women could vote doesn't need to be disrespectful you know, it should be a part of the conversation though, in a positive way. Maybe that could be an easy way to talk to your friend about it. Like yes it does matter and no it is not confrontational it is just a fact. It does not undermine the work suffrage went through it shows HOW much work needed to be done! Baby steps to proguess you know. This shit doesn't happen over night. "
92,"If we shouldn't celebrate August 26 because not all women were granted the right to vote, why should we celebrate Independence Day (July 4)? This was independence for landowning white men only, yet everyone is forced to celebrate it as a federal holiday. It's disgusting.

Also, if we shouldn't celebrate August 26 as commemorating women's right to vote, is there a day that we can put aside to celebrate this? Or should it just not be celebrated at all? What about July 1? On this day the Twenty-Sixth Amendment was passed, lowering the voting age from 21 to 18. I believe this was the last major expansion of the franchise (correct me if I'm wrong) when the right to vote was extended to all women over age 18."
93,"I wanted to say thank you to u/linguinee u/ldpreload and u/Elliotrosemary for your thoughtful replies. I was feeling super crappy about how the conversation was going and feel like I didn't have the tools or support network to bounce ideas off of to continue the conversation. Through your help, and my sleeping on it - I feel a lot better!

I feel like I can see where they are coming from, at least until I get another reply that makes my head spin! lol. On an honest note, I think it does come from wanting to be a nice person, but not having enough experience and information. I remember that I too, would've thought my posts were exclusionary before I learned about feminist theory because after all, I just wanted ""everyone to get along"" a sort of Ghandi peaceful protest approach (before I actually knew anything about Ghandi). Misinformation about how activists we admire is all around, so getting real, in depth info takes time and an interest to seek truth and learn, which not everyone has or wants to do. 

We'll see how it goes! I feel like it was an honest and thoughtful reply. 

On another note, are there other subs that you are very keen on that are also on topic with this post (where an x-post would be applicable). I don't want to x-post, but I'd like to be a part of other subs that keep me thinking and aware.

Thanks again! Phew.... not easy."
94,"Thanks a lot for replying. I do believe they mean it undermines the success of white women in achieving the right for white women to vote. That a win for women, albeit white, is a win for all women and that should be celebrated regardless of their race, creed, sexual orientation, etc. 

They also brought up a post I shared a few days ago, from VIDA Women in Literacy Arts, that talked about 3 women being in the pool for a literary award, and how I specified women, but not their race (they're white women) and how that somehow undermines the women's equality post. 

Again thanks for your reply. I will see if I can skillfully bring up asking for information as to why they're offended by the post aside from all women should celebrate a women's victory."

I felt like the post was a great teaching moment in itself. I think I was getting really hung up because a lot of this is a new way of seeing and thinking for me, so not being super emotionally attached to my ideas/deviations from isn't as well-developed as other thoughts, ways of living, ideas I hold.

I slept on it some more and thought about how I would've felt about the post when I knew nothing about intersectionality and I feel as though I'd probably respond similarly to how they did. The sort of peace for all surface inclusionary ideal that's really harmfully with good intentions painted all over it. So I was honest about that and hopefully something clicks? I also mentioned that maybe they already knew about inclusivity and disagreed and sort of left it at that so as to not make any assumptions.

I look forward to getting more settled, and unsettled - it's all helpful in me staying rooted with actually seeing where I've come from and where I'm going.

Thanks again for getting me thinking about ways to present thoughtful discussions about inclusivity.

Thanks for the link. I shared that and the post has generated a lot of support from various PoC on my FB. 

I've attempted to make it a conversation, but I feel as though they are attempting to one up me rather consistently. Various posts I've made - black female activists disrupting bernie sanders in seattle - women's equality day fb post have brought harsh criticism on their behalf onto me (also criticizing a post I made about women in literary arts up for a prize that's otherwise only been won by men since '96 - me not specifying ""white women"" instead just saying ""women). Trying to hold my ground, be real and be myself - and also leave space for them to have their opinions and feelings/stances. I don't feel like they want to hear it though, they want to say their part and have it be right is how I feel.

I feel like I'm insecure in my own feelings of right/wrong or how to debate with someone/hold a conversation with opposing views because I'm just learning so much about my own identity and ways myself and others are oppressed. I don't know how to effectively ""argue"" (if effectively arguing is a thing) because I'm still PISSED that it's even happened/is happening."
98,"You ask some valid questions. My post is coming from the place of it implied all women won the right to vote, had the date white women won the right to vote, and had a photo with a multitude of women from various ethnic backgrounds further implying all women. The depth of it's wrongness was profound, and that was shared, ideally to be corrected and acknowledged, because not many people know, especially not the generations of people who are frequent facebook users.

Good point about July 4. There are a lot of federal holidays that are disgusting and should be revised or completely taken off the list of 'federal holiday.' Being that August 26 is the day white women won the right to vote, it's wonderful it's mentioned and celebrated - as should the days that all other peoples: black, asian, and native won the right to vote. I think it should be specific, too - 8/26 should mention white women and should mention how long after other peoples earned those same rights. Context is so often erased that we seem like we're swimming in a pool of wonderful, righteous people that ought to be celebrated hardcore!

I'd love to learn more about the dates you mentioned. One of the links someone shared in this post has a historical timeline of voting in the USA, worthy of checking out if you're curious."

100,"I know exactly how you feel.

They seem  more intent on calling you out then looking at intersectionality. It's really frustrating.

Edit: 
Also, as someone who doesn't post a lot of political stuff on fb anymore - I assure you there are many quiet lurkers reading your posts who agree 100%  but are not commenting because it can be so frustrating. "
101,"It feels wrong to celebrate the day ""white women"" won the right to vote, because it's like we're celebrating racism. Again, I would analogize to celebrating July 4 as the day ""white, landowning men"" won their independence... it's a little awkward? Like, if I saw a bunch of people celebrating and I asked, 'why are you celebrating', and they said, 'This is the day that white, landowning men' won their right to political independence', I would be turned off. It's not that I think white, landowning men shouldn't *have* the right to their political independence, but that celebrating such an exclusionary group *feels* wrong. Similarly, I would feel that celebrating *white women* feels wrong because the exclusionary signifier 'white' existed due to the racism felt by POC. Does that make sense?

I admit I have no solution to this issue, I'm just saying I understand why FB included pics of WOC in their picture- even though its historically inaccurate. Maybe it's a matter of WOC 'reappropriating' the day. July 1, 1971 is when the voting age was lowered to 18. I think this is a day that could be celebrated as a universal suffrage day.

In any case, my other problem with Women's Equality Day is that equality didn't happen simply because women got the right to vote. "
102,"Thank you for your thoughtful reply. My friend also brought up the minimum wage debate, saying NYC got the $15 wage, and that should be celebrated. I said yes, I agree, but it wouldn't be truthful to say ""All of minimum wage workers won their $15 wage"" when in fact it was just NYC.

They don't seem to want to agree. Saying it's ""sad"" and further ""separating us"" from one another. 

They also say they have native american roots/ancestry, but identify most closely with their gender (identify as female) and find the post offensive towards their gender. I will note we used to live together, have been friends/acquaintances for 5 years and it's never come up (doesn't have to either) and she's white presenting. I've always assumed she was white. I wonder since it doesn't impact her day to day life, this is found rude/threatening. 

We had a similar debate about the 2 black women who disrupted bernie sanders rally in seattle a few weeks ago. She also found it disrespectful."
103,"How do you feel about no longer making political fb posts? I've thought about that, but it eats me up. I can understand though. I've definitely gone through bouts of anxiety because of how worked up I get, and that doesn't feel good in my body.

I have this ""will not shut the fuck up"" banner I'd like to post as my cover photo, just so we're all clear - lol. "
104,"I think of it as a temporary  thing. And it does ease a lot of my anxiety and anger at the world. It's nice to just turn away from it all sometimes and not get involved. It was the week marriage equality happened and there were a lot of posts about that and the Confederate flag but somehow the icing on the cake was a post about ptsd that made me realize how worked up I was getting. I don't really think I'm going to change other minds (am I really swayed by people's pro life rants? Of course not) it just feels nice to let it go for a while. But, I like seeing my freinds posts and am glad Facebook is used for political purposes, because that way I know I am not alone, I was just getting really worked up about things and so I blocked a lot of people (yes, I get it, you really don't understand why  ""straight pride"" isn't a thing) and stopped posting a lot. Now I just post silly memes and stuff like that. I'm sure I'll get caught up in another political debacle someday on social media but it's really  nice taking the break. I hated feeling attacked for my personal views and maybe that wasn't  people's intention but sometimes I didn't feel safe posting things anymore. 

Oh- I like the idea of your banner too :) "
105,"I tried reading up on your sub to find an answer but didn't find it-- I'll be blunt. 

Do you view the Bible as the word of God, or an interpretation of the word of God? (or something else?)

Do you view yourselves as 'Fundamentalists'? 'Evangelicals?' 

Does a phrase ""Women must be submissive to her man.."" enter the conversation at any point?

Should I? If so, why?

Should we treat the bible as anything more than another book of advice, so we can reject parts, and accept others, as we would any other book? Why?"
108,"I would say that Radical Christians for the most part have a very high view of scripture. More than that I cannot say, as formulations are diverse. The key component of being a radical Christian is being an intense and different one.

Radical Christians avoid the fundamentalist and evangelical monikers because they are associated with parts of Christian culture. Radical Christians generally reject most major Christian cultures.

I am sure that phrase does come up in conversation as both men and women are known to be radical Christians and they do tend to get married, and that phrase is a verse in the bible. It doesn't come up in my conversations that much because I am under a vow of celibacy."
109,"The radicalchristianity sub is pretty much the opposite of everything that gets your goat.  I'm a subscriber, though I don't know if I'm quite liberal enough for them; but I've been enjoying participating there.

But here's my take on your questions:

1. I'd call the Bible a set of records of humankind's most important interactions with God.  

2. Absolutely not and absolutely not.  Or, my take: Fundamentalist?  Yes!  And those fundamentals are love, joy, peace, patience, meekness, faith in the risen Christ.  The fundamentals have nothing to do with Republican party garbage.  And Evangelical?  Yes!  Excited about the *Evangelium*, the Good News that God is for all people, that he not only accepts the underprivileged, he frankly gets along better with them.

3. Every Christian is supposed to submit to each other.  Being male or a husband doesn't exempt anybody from the call to universal submission.  There is no hierarchy in Christ."
110,"I'm probably more mainstream in my theology but I'll give this a go.

1. Sure. But our interpretation matters too. You can, in fact, cherry-pick as much as you want. I don't want to arbitrate limits, but for me, I often ask myself this: is what I'm ignoring still going along with what the whole project of Christianity is about?

2. Those words mean little to me. I'll go with /u/gnurdette's answer

3. Not really a thing for me, at all. In fact, that's part of the bible I tend to ignore."
111,"Quite true. Unfortunately it seems that the majority of the questions have been of a type that I can only answer from a personal perspective. I was hoping to answer all kinds of questions about Christian anarchists, Christian feminists, gay Christians, Christian communists, Christian philosophers combining the works of Paul Tillich, John MacArthur, Plotinus, Ayn Rand, and Karl Marx, etc. Didn't quite turn out like that, LOL. But hopefully some of them will come and check out the sub."
112,"Hmm. Well again we're talking about matters of Christian faith rather than matters of Radical Christianity.

You did address this question directly to me. I'll say that I am an extremely philosophical and thoughtful Christian. The answers that I would tend to give would be very lengthy and heady. I will say that I believe in God as a result of personal experience and contemplation. I was not raised in a Christian environment. My own psychological journey was quite instrumental in my coming to belief.

I highly recommend that you believe in God, LOL. As for why, well, there is just so much more to life beyond living for a few decades here on earth and dying. There are so many grander ideas at play than getting a better job or accomplishing a task or finding a relationship. There is also the aspect that, according to Christianity, life here on earth is only a very very tiny piece of all that we will be as immortal and perfect beings in the future. Beyond the 'benefits to us' that come with God, there is also the simple joy of knowing him. He's really really cool. God is love. Having a relationship with a being that is just so incredible, omnipotent even, and so absolutely wonderful is just an amazing joy.

As for the bible, I really don't know what to say. I personally have a very high view of scripture, higher than a number of the people that I have met in life that I would call radical Christians, and higher than most people on the /r/radicalchristianity subreddit as far as I can tell. I have come to this position after many years. I will say that having had this perspective has unlocked many mysteries for me. I have learned many profound things because I was not willing to just say, 'this part is bullshit.'

With that said, though, I can remember back to being a young man and talking with a friend of mine, another young guy, while we were high on Robotussin, LOL, about Christianity. He was a Christian and I was not yet. I told him that there were a lot of things about Christianity that appealed to me, but that I was just appalled by an uncountable number of things in the bible. He said, ""well don't worry about the bible then."" If he hadn't said that, I probably wouldn't have stepped forward on my spiritual journey toward Christ. I probably wouldn't be here 20 years later as a believer in plenary biblical inspiration.

So I don't know what to tell you about the bible. There is more in it than you will ever find. If you think about what it says you will learn things that you would never imagine. But do you need to have a definite opinion on it right now? Do you need to subscribe to some published philosophy about it? No."

I mis-phrased my question, I think. It wasn't ""what are the benefits you find in believing in god"", but ""how can I tell that there is a god?"" If there is a god, I want to believe in one. If no god exists, I want to believe there is no god. But as long as I can't tell whether there's a god, I want to neither believe nor disbelieve.

There are specific claims you're making that right now I don't believe. Saying what you get out of those beliefs isn't convincing."
115,"Well, I'd say these questions might be posed to Christians in general and are not really related to the subject of radical Christianity. I'll do my best to offer what I can, though. Now first, I'll say that I am a subscriber to the sub, but more of a lurker there. I identify myself as knowledgeable about Radical Christianity because I associate with individuals and groups that espouse similar ideas to those on the sub. As the sub states, Radical Christianity is about tying Christian faith to a very diverse range of philosophies, theologies, and political views. Now the term Radical Christianity has been commandeered at certain points by Evangelical groups in the past who wish to emphasize an iconoclastic element of their faith. That sort of evangelicalism is not the sort of thinking that is espoused on the sub or in the real life groups that I have associated with. These groups tend to have unusual views on doctrine and practice. That's what makes a Radical Christian.

That being said, I can only give my view as to why God allows people to suffer, and my doing so would not be in keeping with answering questions about Radical Christianity as a group. You might then be tempted to confuse my view with those of other members of the sub, particularly those with a lot more seniority and activity there than I have.

As to your questions about reconciliation of Radical Christians' practices and beliefs with a perceived misogyny in Christianity, I can only say that Radical Christians really aren't known for espousing such practices. Radical Christians are known more for being Christians who are communists or anarchists and the like. They are known for an eclectic internalization of philosophies. As such, practices and beliefs are going to be extremely divergent. Radical Christian groups, of which the sub is one, are hardly associated with certain Christian cultural practices of forcing women to wear bonnets or dresses or saying that it is unbiblical for a woman to get a job. Radical Christians are known to be very socially liberal, although some of them are socially liberal while ethically conservative or theologically conservative. Basically to be a radical Christian is to be an iconoclastic Christian. On the sub, very pronounced acceptance of LGBT or feminist groups and ideas is the norm. Condemnations against racism are the norm.

I guess I would say that radical Christianity doesn't make any effort to reconcile anything with traditional Christianity. That's why it's radical."
116,"How can you tell that there is a God? If I had an answer to that I'd probably be famous. It's always a personal experience and generally one based on psychology that leads people to God. I think the stuff your wanting is generally the stuff you get after you've met God. He's real big on not forcing himself on people that don't want him.

About your being convinced, I'll say that I was not envisioning this as an apologetic AMA but was more expecting people to be asking about radical Christianity, the subreddit and other groups that take the name, talking about radical Christians' views on feminism, various political and philosophical stances taken by radical Christian types, demographic questions about age and gender and all. Actually getting into it with an atheist or agnostic about the existence of God really was not something I was planning for and isn't really related to the subject. I answered the questions because they were specifically addressed to me about my beliefs and, well, this is an AMA - ask me anything. So I answered. If you are interested in questions of faith and would like to inquire or debate the existence of God or reality of Christianity then there are multiple subs out there. When I came here I was not intent on or hoping to win converts to the faith with this AMA. That you are not on your knees praising Jesus really isn't surprising. Maybe head over to /r/radicalchristianity and ask there? If you're curious?"
117,Thanks for your thoughtful answers!
118,"My thought is basically that if there isn't a god that was involved in the bible, than I can take the good things and ignore the bad -- or even not prioritize reading it at all. If there's a god involved, figuring out what that being said becomes way more important.

And fair enough on this not being envisioned as an apologetic AMA. I will say, though, that I don't find personal experience very compelling -- if I had one, it would seem many orders of magnitude more likely that I would be mistaken, rather than there being all sorts of beings, forces, and powers we don't understand and haven't seen good proof of."
119,"Your reading of the Bible is pretty much everyone's reading of the Bible. Bible-thumpers like to say that they believe in Scripture, but few people (including Jews) take the Jubilee practice seriously. Christians won't take abstaining from shellfish seriously. It's OK for them to ignore ""love your enemies"" but not OK for us to love gay people and even accept homosexuality as a practice? Or not OK to think that ""we are all one in Christ"" is less important than ""wives, obey your husbands?"" (and the latter quote should always be paired with ""husbands honour your wives"" for anyone to even be remotely taken seriously, let alone actually be followed)."
120,"Wow, great argument. Thanks."
121,Can we accept now that this movie is only here to capitalize on and appropriate the Black Lives Matter movement?
122,"The film's been in production for years, they don't just squirt them out in response to whatever's trending on twitter this week."
123,The short answer to the question is - no.
124,I think this article was interesting because I recently watched the video of Hillary Clinton meeting with the BLM activists and it seemed like they were talking past each other.
125,It sure didn't work for the girl screaming in Bernie Sanders' face the other day in Seattle.
126,"On the contrary, in light of Sanders's response, her tactics seem to have been very effective--perhaps because what she was doing wasn't just ""asking white people for moral self-reflection."""
127,"This video is about the intersectional relationship between race and gender in North American culture. I will discuss how the institution of slavery problematizes ""stereotypical"" definitions of Femininity in our culture when thinking of the public/private divide and gender norms in North America. "
128,[deleted]
129,Thank you so much :)
130,"I realized that I used to say stuff like ""you're not like other ____"" and I didn't realize how racist that was. Then I learned and every time I look back at high school, I cringe >.>

Like I think I meant that he didn't make fun of me for my taste in music, that he actually believed that white folk can play jazz (another kid in band was adamant that only black people could play jazz), and that he wasn't into rap which I had been taught was scary music.

So yeah there was definitely racism there. "
131,"If it's any consolation, when I was in college, I thought my love for French fashion after studying abroad was totes the same thing as cultural appropriation."
132,At this point I'll vote for whoever seems strongest in their conviction to set us back to a point where money /= speech.  Bernie seems to be the one pushing for that... and I happen to agree with most of the other things he's been saying for a very long time.
133,"Bernie is good about a lot, and come primaries, I'll probably vote for him.

He's historically been good on women's issues and LGBT issues. For instance, he voted against DOMA while Hillary voted in favor of it.

That said, he's not the best in race. His main focus is his socialism, which is admirable, but gives him a few blind spots. He seems to think that all issues facing black people in America stem from economic problems, but it's not jobs that would keep PoC from being routinely murdered by police officers.

That said, although he tried out some All Loves Matter rhetoric last month or so, the backlash was pretty fierce and he's stepped away from it."
134,"Bernie has an excellent track record, and is not PAC funded. Hillary just another politician in the hands of corporate America. Feminism as a philosophy never dictates that you must vote for a female candidate in a democracy. You vote for who backs your cause. He is the only candidate out there that I am excited about, because he's the only presidential candidate that doesn't obey corporate America. He gets it."
135,"Bernie's okay.

He's no WEB Dubois, but I don't despise him, I suppose."
136,I fucking love Bernie! 
137,"Hi, OP!

I'm a soon-to-be Bernie volunteer. I was at one of those 3500 house parties in all 50 states on Wednesday.
Mine was at a Retirement Village about an hour away. The other local parties filled up too fast, so I had to travel a little.

Bernie is an old hippie that has worked tirelessly for The People.

I'm a 47 yr. old woman, Quaker, happily married, Mom from Indiana. I have crowd issues, so I don't go out of my house that much.

I am voting for Bernie because he walks the walk and talks the talk. He thinks and talks in terms of all of us; no matter what our flavor...ALL of The People.

Personally I think, the heroes of the Occupy Movement will find a big ally in him. His views are similar.

The biggest insult used against Bernie is being called a Socialist. He smiles and explains what a Democratic Socialist is.

He's squeaky clean. Worth less than a million $.

Bernie is authentic. I think this country NEEDS that right now. We can't go on like this.

"
138,"You're asking a lot of questions, so I'm going to skip over the presidential one. I live in Georgia, so my vote in the presidential election doesn't matter much.

Conservatives are better with their ""get out the vote"" campaigns. Conservatives voted in the Midterm elections; progressives did not. Voter turnout in the US is pathetic, especially for elections other than the presidential election. 

In regards to who's running, most people can't just immediately run to be a US rep or senator. They have to work their way up politically. City and state politics are so much more important than people realize. 

I've watched the people in my home state of South Carolina slowly work their way up the ranks, or at least try to. Party politics is at play here. Lindsay Graham didn't run for Senate until a Republican senator retired. That opened up a US rep seat. I knew personally some of the men who then ran to be a representative. They were mostly politicians either in the SC House/Senate. I assume the same sort of inner-party politics is true for the Democratic Party. 

Encouraging our friends and family to vote in all elections is something that each of us, as individuals, can do. Encouraging our friends and family to elect certain candidates is also something we can do. It won't matter who runs if we're not out there voting for them."
139,"I'm skipping your presidential question for a statement about the House. Right now the House is gerrymandered enough that many progressive votes simply don't matter. There are some fair odds that after the next census they won't be able to keep it up due to changing demographics, so I think you might see a surge of progressives in the 2022 midterms when midterms are normally dominated by conservatives (well, whoever doesn't have the presidency, but I don't see them getting the oval office in the next 8 years)."
140,"Bernie is a terrible candidate
he does not support women s rights nor black rights
if i were you, i would not wast my vote on him, vote Hillary, we NEED a first female president for the diversity   "
141,"Well at least I'm hearing some positive things , I was worried I was going to get backlash making this post here. I agree Bernie's campaign message needs some fixture or better highlights on certain issues. Though his commitment and conviction on what he says is amazing, he truly is a real liberal progressive politician in contemporary politics. 

Also how do you feel that there's no real progressive women in power, from local/city, state, and national? I really love Elizabeth Warren, but she won't run for president, because she believes she can get more done introducing and moving legislation in congress and maybe that's true. Where are the other progressive woman who want to do this, I know there's political apathy in this country and it makes everybody jaded, but then why do people protest, as I said it brings light to a situation but you need people at the top to advocate for you if you want to see change and at the moment there is barely anyone in power who really cares.  "
142,What don't you like about him? Id like to say though that he is one of the most or even the most progressive contemporary politician we have in this country.
143,"I think your out of your depth, Hilary is a shill for multi millionaire and billionaire corporation, she's funded by Monsanto and Big Banks among other untasteful companies, and she's against raising the minimum wage to $15h. Bernie Sanders has been for women, lgbtq, and labor rights since the early seventies probably even earlier, and his campaign is filled to the brim with honesty, integrity and a message about improving America in all aspects. I'm going to vote for Bernie in the primaries, but if he doesn't win I'll refuse to vote in the 2016 election, Hilary Clinton has more interests in keeping everything the same, with veil of change than actually doing something different for the American people."
144,"You're right, as far as US politicians go, he's great.

But I'm a communist, and social democrats like Bernie still plan on keeping capitalism intact, so he is very far from my beliefs."
145,"Woah, people are still communists? Communism doesn't even work in a big society unless you force it and take away peoples right, it could work in smaller nation or community maybe, but communism would never work in America.

Edit: Cuba is probably the only communist country to follow it as closely as possible, but even Cuba is starting to allow some small capitalist enterprises in the country. Capitalism is not bad, but crony capitalism is bad. When all the wealth is going to the top 1% or even 0.1%, and those multi-billion dollar countries not paying taxes are bad."
146,"Had this conversation a thousand times, check out /r/socialism_101 to learn about it."
147,"My problem with communism is that I would not be able to own my own business, because right now I'm working and eventually I want to start my own business in the near future and communism would not allow me to do that. I would see our society become an Anarchist one before Communism takes hold of America.

Edit: I am Anti Fascist though."
148,"Anarcho-communism.  Please read about it, and why owning that business, if you employ anyone, is exploitative.  I'd rather not have this conversation for the millionth time, so this is my last reply, but you would be benefiting yourself to read about it."
149,"The thing is is that under communism, here taken as a statelss, classless, moneyless society, there would be no need to have a business and anything similar to a business would be collectively owned and the products free to all anyway. The idea of owning a business as a life-goal is only meaningful under capitalism where owning the means of capital allows one to have a better life than those that do not, but this very opportunity can only exist on the backs of those that do not own capital i.e. the workers. If everyone owned their own business, then there would be no workers to work for those businesses and few can survive without employees."
150,"I guess we have a difference of opinions. I just don't like communism it doesn't work. Why don't you move to North Korea? China and Cuba are tame in a communistic aspect. Ideally it would be a moneyless, stateless, society but there's always a leader with  an ungodly amount of consolidated power and in almost 100 year that there have been communistic countries most have been oppressive regimes that do not allow and even harshly punish dissent to the point of creating labor camps to "" re-educate"" people to saids country narrative. When I think of communism I think of a community working together communities are small, true communism could work in a small community but would never work in large scale youll always get differing and opposing opinions and America would never be a communistic country because of all the opposing opinions here. If communists in America want to live in a communist country they should move to one , it would only happen here with a armed rebellion killing every ""Fascist pig"" in this country and there's more of these than comrades in the US. 

Edit: Amish people are a perfect representative of a ""communist"" society, they're mostly self sufficient and peaceful and its voluntary, once you get bigger and bigger with the community its gets harder to control. The thing I don't understand though us how china has not fallen apart yet, but the population is probably pretty fearful of the government, which is sad.  "
151,"The prevailing ideology of most communist countries has been Marxist-Leninism or some variation of this which emphasizes party conformity and centralization, both of which I object to as an anarchist. Any community beyond what one can comfortably walk is too big to be governed by a centralized governing body since that body would be alienated from the community. You also seem to have a pre-dispostion toward treating the United States as a legitimate entity when it would simply cease to be a whole under anarchy which tends to not look kindly towards nation-states period."
152,"Sometimes I want to consider myself an Anarchist, like I have a lot of respect and interest in Catalonia in 1930s Spain, I'm also intrigued right now by the Kurdish PKK movement in Turkey because of the libertarian-socialist structure and anarcho-communist leadership roles. I just think it's very hard to lead a community that's get bigger and bigger and less homogeneous, you are going to get differing opinions, and when a community gets bigger and bigger you rule with violence and force and star eroding personal liberties and even begin consolidating and centralizing power to a small and powerful group to maintain status quo. I'm split between communism doesn't work on large scale where it could work in a small scale homogeneous community, that's just my two cents."
153,"It's an interesting look from the perspective of a Native feminist, but it doesn't really do much to provide an alternative for the current system. It's just a criticism of the white-washed America and the, in her eyes, unhelpful Native response to that America. How, exactly, should we change the system? Do you want to merge Native egalitarian goals ideals with what is or revamp it into something completely different? How do you think Native communities *should* be responding?

I also felt a little underwhelmed with her criticisms of American feminism. I think it's a little off base to say the suffragette movement co-opted Native feminism; I doubt most suffragettes were even aware of the struggles of Native women or what Native culture was like pre-colonialism, and I don't think oppressed people rising up to fight for their own rights are necessarily co-opting anything. Especially since she clearly feels that the ideas of Native feminism and American feminism are pretty different. BUT, I can understand where that feeling comes from, since the colonial, white, American culture swooped in and violently displaced the Native cultures, it's a really tricky subject to capture all the angles of, and seems like something that has no ""right"" way of looking at. I don't know anything about the history of pre-colonial feminism in America, though, so I could be way off base with this paragraph.

As far as revamping feminism with the Native population at its center, why should we focus on changing one ethnicity as the ""main"" group to another? Why can't we just continue growing intersectionalism so that there is no main ethnicity at the forefront of feminism, so that women of all ethnicities have their respective issues validated by everyone else? I don't think we're quite there yet, but I like to believe we're heading in the right direction.

Honestly, I feel way too ignorant to really respond to this piece properly, but I felt it deserved discussion and, well, I read it so here are my thoughts. I'm not an academic though, so please feel free to correct any misonceptions I have."
154,"As a non-American, I found this very interesting. My culture is so exposed to the US culture, yet all we see of Native people are (what I am assuming) the stereotypes."
155,"Honestly, I think you nailed the information in this article on the head. No, it does not promote any real, concrete solutions to the issues brought about by colonization, but that stems the question, are there any real solutions?

I think that the biggest thing the author is looking for is awareness that 

A) Native woman can be feminists

 B)Not all native cultures empowered women, and that has led to unique issues within the community,

 C) Most important of all, native women exist, they are not stereotypes, and their issues are also worth looking at.


The biggest issue Natives on the whole face is not alcoholism, or the reservation system, or even the deep scars from the past 100 years of forced integration, but to get other groups to acknowledge that Native peoples are not the stereotypes they have in their head, and they are still a group being actively oppressed. I have had countless people tell me that I don't fit into their vision of a native woman because my skin isn't dark enough or I don't present myself as some Pocahontas look alike. 

Yes, it does lack some points that I think would be helpful, like real solutions to our current issues, but I'm happy with this piece as an introduction to the idea of Native feminism. 
"
156,"You're right, I think I was a little too critical on the article in my response. It really is more of an awareness essay and it does a great job laying out the biggest issues facing the Native communities and presenting their feminist ideals as actively refuting the whitewashed, patriarchal structure in America.

Mostly, it got me thinking very hard and critically about a whole slew of issues I'd never really considered before, which I really appreciate. I think that's a win for any piece of academic writing haha.

Thanks for sharing the article and replying; I'd hoped there would have been more discussion but I guess this community is still growing."
157,"I had hoped for more discussion too, but I think we'll get there! For now, I'm happy to chat, but I know that my view is very skewed. Glad you liked the article though!"
158,"wonderful article. thanks for sharing.

also, not to change the subject, but

> If anything, the powerlessness we feel as a result of sexism too often urges us to hold on to, and exert over others, what remaining power we have.

i'm looking at you, TERFs.
"
159,Call it out.
160,It also makes me think of the #whitewomendoitbetter. Same vein pretty much.  
161,"I've never heard of an issue about this in the UK, and we actually have quite a lot of white people with dreads in certain areas here. I don't think I've seen any with corn rows or anything though. Maybe it's the kind of people I'm friends with, but I personally know 8 or more white people (including my ex-wife) who have/had dreads and I've never heard accusations of appropriation"
162,"I need help seeing this in a better light. I'm white with very curly, unruly, thick hair. I have to use products marketed to African American women. If I let my hair do what it wanted to, it would be dreadlocked pretty quickly.

I don't really want to do that, but if I did, how is that cultural appropriation? I genuinely want to understand appropriation better so that I can be a better feminist and activist. Help?"
163,"As a black women I believe race does not own a hairstyle and hair isn't always race specific. they are not using the dreads as a mockery; they sincerely love the style. The same with clothing articles. Now, if they used the dreads and followed the whitegirlsdoitbetter hashtag i would see something wrong with it. because no race does something better than the other to me."
164,"If it affects women it's a feminist issue, so yeah."
165,I must be missing something. Is this an issue? Why can't a woman wear her hair however she wants? 
166,"Campbell's Soup, lets do this.  Dreadlocks are a hair style.  It takes maintenance to achieve nice looking dreads and not just mats.  They don't just happen.  Natty hair just happens no matter what your skin color is.    If someone believes in a ""cultural meaning"" for that style, great they have every right to believe in that.  That does not mean they own it.   "
167,"This article has it completely wrong, imo. If this becomes more common among other cultures, it will become more accepted, and you may find that suddenly work places are less likely to reject it. It wouldn't be for the ""right"" reason, but it still pushes back against racism by reducing the available means of harassment.

A person is free to control their body and appearance. I value this highly. Unless they are specifically doing so to make a mockery of someone else, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and let them enjoy their body."
168,"As a French, I was curious about that too. I think European country don't have the same relation to race as America has, mostly because we don't have the same history, obviously... But also, it seems to me (though I'm really only talking for France here, as I don't know enough about how it is in other European countries), we don't have that same culture of ""different but equal"" that is so fundamental in the USA...

Then again, maybe I'm just talking nonsense here, so I'd like to hear more about that from Americans, or European people of color to have their point of view on this."
169,"Dreadlocks are not simply matted hair, though. It's a style you have to regularly re-twist and wash and maintain. 

The problem with white people getting them, or any other black hairstyle is not only that it's unnatural for their texture, but also that they typical do it to be ""earthy"" and cool, while black people lose jobs and get shat on for the same shit (I don't get to be an earthy hippie - they use words like ""savage"" instead).

It makes a mockery of the way we live, and serves as a visual and visceral reminder that ""black"" things only matter when not attached to actual black people."
170,"sure, but not everything is a good thing to do, just like not everything is a good thing to say."
171,"I agree, an European point of view would be nice. I live in pretty much the whitest country of all, Norway, and only reading US-based sources doesn't help me all that much, trying to navigate my whiteness. We have our own set of race problems, both because of our history, but also because of the demographics. It's a good start, but doesn't come that far."
172,"Ok, that is starting to make some sense. Thank you."
173,"This. Also it's accessorizing a hairstyle that has [significant cultural meaning,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreadlocks#Africa_and_the_Western_World.3B_Caribbean.2C_North_and_South_America) and removing it from this context is harmful."
174,"As a maybe interesting aside from the UK, I know as least two black women who have dreadlocks and hold down white collar jobs. They keep everything tidy, and always worn up.

Also, many many black women here wear their hair in small braids tied back - does that happen a lot in the US?"
175,Lolwut. I'm pretty sure a person with dreads isn't likely to find a normal job regardless of their race. 
176,"Fair enough, maybe I'm insensitive but how bad can ones hair style be to really affect anyone else? My girlfriend who happens to be black straightens her hair sometimes. Very rarely because it's a huge pain but it looks beautiful. Is that wrong somehow? I've considered getting dreadlocks she thinks it would be super hot. Just because I'm white and she's black doesn't mean we have to stick to our racial norms. In fact it seems fretting over this is just dividing us opposed to bringing us together which is bad.   "
177,"did you read the article? read the article. if you're still confused, google it. still don't get why hair is a big deal for black women? ask your girlfriend (esp if she's cis) what hair meant to her growing up

if you feel the same after that, then i'll respond fully."
178,"I mean I can see where they are coming from but I must disagree a little bit. I remember my gf talking about how annoying it is that many black hairstyles are banned from her work place but she's never seen white people wearing their hair similar as a mockery or dehumanizing in any way but I guess I can see how it could be offensive to some. I think I'm more on the side of [this](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/white-woman-black-hairstyle-cultural-appropriation). I have a feeling she will be too but I'll have to wait it's 4 a.m here and she needs her sleep. I understand why hair is a big deal to black woman, I know being white I have many privileges, and I know I won't ever fully understand what it's like to be black so maybe I can't be right here. Whenever I see a girl with dreadlocks all I see is a girl with dreadlocks not their race, maybe that's a bad thing I'm not sure anymore.
 "
179,"While I'm sure this may be a misunderstanding, please avoid being trans-exclusionary as much as possible on this subreddit or at least clearly explain why it is necessary to say ""esp if she's cis"". 

There are many trans girls who have hated short haircuts from a very young age and have had long hair. In addition, other trans people have started hormones from a very young age and have experienced many of the growing up experiences as cis people. "
180,"it's not the worst thing, and not everyone has awful intentions, i'll admit that. but kylie and runway models and major fashion houses repeatedly make money off of ""black looks"" without ever incorporating black people. cultural exports are fine, but *i* don't have the chance to profit off of my culture - i have to mute it just to get my foot in the door - so why can others? it's annoying, and it fits with a larger pattern of exploitation.

here's a fun fact: i knew a white girl who had dreadlocks, hated words like bae and other slang that came from the black community, *and* said the n word. "
181,"it wasn't necessary and i think it sounds weird now 

but it's not to be trans-exclusionary (*i'm*.... well,) so much as to put a focus on the experience of being raised as a little girl. regardless of who you are, if you go out into the world as a little black girl with coarse hair, you're going have a more stressful time regarding hair, you're more likely to be required to have worn hairstyles that hurt and know that the alternative is being ostracized, etc. i wanted to focus on that experience in children bc, well, that's when you have the least choice, and i think that experience is crucial to why a lot of us are up in arms over this stuff"
182,"Yeah that is pretty fucked up. I talked to my girlfriend and she shares the same concerns and many more but said saying a certain style belongs to a race is like saying she couldn't let her son play with dolls because their only for girls, and imitation is the greatest form of flattery. I've kinda always wanted dreads but I never even thought about how it could be seen that way. I remember when my gf got hired and they told her her hair had to be ""professional"" heavily implying she couldn't have her twists, she tried to explain it was practical not a statement but they wouldn't allow it. Now she has to spend forever to get ready especially since her hair is extra thick. Sucks I miss her twists. To be fair I don't think they'd let a white girl work there with the same style but it wouldn't be about practicality for her. 
I remember feeling a little similar when Caitlin Jenner was in the spot light showing off how nice transition is when your rich while people like me and Laverne Cox have had to fight and struggle the whole way. Not culture but it makes the struggle look easy. I know that's not the same. 
That girl sounds awful. I feel like I've learned a lot today thank you for keeping the conversation  "
183,"If you were never a young trans girl, you don't really have any awareness of what a young trans girl's experiences of beauty standards and body policing are.

Suggesting that cis girls have a better understanding of the politics of black hair, as you did, seems to be making a lot of transmisogynist assumptions about what trans girlhoods are like."
184,"Well, I can't read their minds, so I'd say try asking them.

But, the general purpose of Feminism is to allow Women to be as appreciated, respected, and safe as our Male counterparts. 

This is not currently what our society offers, and it can be hard to see unless you have our perspective."
185,"From what I gather, they feel that feminism is about taking away rights from men and punishing them for being men. "
186,"Probably for the same reason they believe lesbians also hate men, I suppose? 

What **is** this reason, though... I must admit I have no idea. I know some people think you hate them/take it as a personal aggression when you disagree with them or their point of view, it might be something similar? "
187,"It isn't just men. There are many women who view it that way too. 

But as for why, it's because feminism is many things, but in every incarnation it is a critical perspective on institutions. It takes what many people are brought up to believe is ""normal"" and reinterprets it in a way that reveals inequalities and very gender-biased assumptions. Some people, particularly, although not exclusively, conservatives, are very attached to those same institutions and seek to defend them. Claiming that Feminism is really all just rooted in misandry is a strawman argument designed for that purpose. "
188,"In my opinion, it is due to the invisibility of the power gradient that exists when viewed from a position of privilege.  Especially when we are dealing with subtle nuanced discrimination and levels of privilege that some people have over others, it becomes very hard to realize how the lived experience of others is fundamentally different than your own.  When viewed this way, it becomes easy to perceive any attempt to level the playing field as attempting to raise the group of lesser privilege above yourself.  Thus feminism is viewed as an attack on men who ""haven't done anything wrong"" by existing within the structure they are accustomed to.  Back in my highschool days, people would joke about the ""oppressed middle class white male"" in the sense that scholarships and other things were far easier to come by if female, poor, or a minority.  This seemed unfair to me at the time (silly me, still unknowingly pretending to be a guy), but it was because I had no exposure to the institutional bias that favored me and not the other groups.  I perceived affirmative action and feminism as things that limited my prospects as opposed to things that merely attempted to balance out the inherent bias in the system.

Add to this the fact that the more radical the group the more likely they are to be highlighted by the media, and now you've set the public up with the feeling that the goal of feminism is to radically overhaul society into one where men are all subservient to women."
189,"Normally when I hear sentiments like this it's an MRA who wants to prove a point and has a few examples from Twitter or Tumblr of a pro-feminist person saying outlandish things, and then the MRA person says all feminists must believe this, or why aren't we out there fighting with said outlandish feminists, etc.

Protip: we do, quite often."
190,"I listened to a [very interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y8XgGhXkTQ) (not the only one, but the one that I thought of immediately) Youtube series that discussed how someone benefitting from a form of prejudice might be unwilling to acknowledge its existence because it in some way makes that individual ""guilty by association."" That in some way, one could not like an aspect of a society or culture and acknowledge that it (unintentionally or intentionally) supports a form of prejudice or privilege. In this way, someone might feel personally attacked, like his/her morality, or goodness as a human being, is called into question with the breaching of such a topic. 

Although I find it helpful to look at forms of systemic discrimination, prejudice, or privilege from a more sociological perspective when trying to understand broader historical or cultural contexts for a particular behavior, this particular series made self-described ""anti-feminists"" more understandable and sympathizable on a human level.

198,"hehe, and this is partially why some people view feminism as being hating of or exclusionary to men.  I believe their comment was relevant in that it was an attempt to illustrate a viewpoint that causes the perception that feminism is anti-men.  There is a structure that this person has built that forms their perception of reality.  As incomplete as that structure may be, they were calmly laying it out and being open about their perception of feminism as they know it.  If we go through and exclude that view as opposed to engage it with dialogue to attempt to understand the structure and underlying assumptions it is composed of, it would turn the community into an echo chamber where similar thoughts are reinforced with little substantive discourse.  We also further support their view that feminism is exclusionary and does indeed not care about the places where men are legitimately disadvantaged as compared to women."

200,"In that case what is downvoting for if not to give less importance to a particular comment, sometimes to the point of hiding it from view?

The above comment resulted in an educational discussion in which the person expressed a valid reason as to why feminism is viewed as anti-male from the standpoint of many of the people who hold that view, regardless of how much that perception was based in a full understanding of reality.  The resulting discussion provided the person the opportunity to learn a bit about how their views did not accurately encompass feminism and might result in that person seeing feminism in a more positive light.  Seems relevant to me."
201,"How should I say this? This is an excellent article for explaining how white people should approach anti-racist **ally-ship**. But I don't think that a **friendship** can flourish under the same conditions presented in the majority of the article. Consider the following paragraph from the article:

>I am of the opinion that white people who have a robust POC circle[of friends] should be more vigilant of their privilege than the white person who does not. Sometimes closeness can breed a dangerous form of familiarity. It is like the cisgender hetero woman who has a bastion of gay male friends, but thinks she can appropriate gay men’s lingo and speak for gay men. **Proximity to Blackness is not an excuse to NOT police your whiteness**.

So, having to ""police"" some aspect of yourself around someone else does not make for a very emotionally intimate relationship. I'd say doing so precludes any  friendship where both parties can show even the worst sides of themselves and still be accepted. The author goes on to say that the white person in the friendship must be willing to accept criticism on racial issues from the POC friend, which I think is helpful in developing a relationship, but seems to imply that this would not be a two-way street. In any case, I do like that the author expresses the value of interracial friendships in the closing:

>These friendships can work and can help to heal cultural and historical wounds on both sides. Friendship offers a different level of intimacy and partnership that romantic relationship often lack and struggle to maintain. In order for interracial friendships to work, both parties must be willing to address the power dynamics of the friendship and both parties must be willing to be vulnerable with each other about what they can or cannot deal with within the friendship space"
202,">It is like the cisgender hetero woman who has a bastion of gay male friends, but thinks she can appropriate gay men’s lingo and speak for gay men. 


Don't understand the problem, at least with the whole ""lingo"" thing.  You pick up things and use the same language as your friends.  I don't really see a problem, in theory, with ""speaking for gay men"" but I understand how easy it is for some to go from speaking from their own experiences intermingling with other groups of people to speaking *over* them like some sort of expert.  But then at the same time, there's gay men (to go along with the example) who do speak as if they're ""experts"" and yet what they does not represent all, or even most gay men."
203,">So, having to ""police"" some aspect of yourself around someone else does not make for a very emotionally intimate relationship. I'd say doing so precludes any friendship where both parties can show even the worst sides of themselves and still be accepted.

Why not? You ""police"" yourself every day, presumably. I used to make a lot of AIDS jokes when I was younger, but I had a friend whose uncle had died of AIDS. So I ""policed"" that part of me.
I'm pro-choice, and I used to talk about abortion rights all the time. But, I knew someone who had been forced to have an abortion after a rape, and constant abortion chatter reminded her of that event. So I ""policed"" that part of me. 
I have a few friends who believe in God. We can have frank discussions about God, about their belief or my nonbelief, but I do away with the ""fuck religion"" thing, and they mute the ""pray about it"" stuff.

Also - honestly, it's not really a two-way street when it comes to racial issues. What meaningful, non-racist critique would a white person have with the way I express my blackness?"
204,"Would you have been more comfortable if the author had written, ""While around POC, be prepared to codeswitch""?  

As /u/mikeycix mentioned, we ""police"" ourselves all the time.  The language and the things you talk about around your boss are probably different from what you'd say to your best friend, your girlfriend/boyfriend, or your parents.  Roles and codeswitching is literally Sociology 101.  If you haven't taken it, here's a quick recap: you're not just one person to all people.  Different people see different facets of you—they see you in different roles.  While you're in each role, your vocabulary and behavior change.  For example, when you're around your parents and fulfilling the role of son/daughter, you'll be more likely to talk about school or work than the hot person you've been banging for the past three months and their weird hangups.  When you're at work and in the role of employee, you're more likely to talk about the projects you're working on than the ridiculous penalty shot some player made the other night.

Let's go back to my initial question.  Would you have been more comfortable if the author had written, ""While around POC, be prepared to codeswitch?""  If so, do you think she should've written that instead of ""Proximity to Blackness is not an excuse to NOT police your whiteness""?"
205,"Certain words are very political, and should be confined to specific subgroups and/or environments. Like, if you're a white person with black friends who use the N word, you shouldn't use that word yourself. That's for them. If you're straight and your gay friends call each other the f word, then you shouldn't do the same. And if you're cis and your drag queen friends use the T or S word, then you shouldn't use those words. 

Additionally, there's the sociopolitical element in North America of white people  (and especially non-black gay men) being lauded (or at worst lightly teased) for appropriating AAVE, while black folks who use AAVE get discriminated against socially, in employment practices, at the workplace, in school, in the media, by police, etc. Same goes with white folks appropriating black culture or physical traits associated with blackness (see: Iggy Azalea, Kylie Jenner, etc.)...often acclaimed for doing so, while black people are often  discriminated for it. I could keep going, but I think I've made my point.

As for ""speaking for"" groups aside from your own, that's just not good practice. If you must do so, only elevate the words you've heard from members of that group...if you can't recall those words, don't speak of them, or for that group, at all. 

And no, one member of a social group cannot speak for the whole. However, they are most certainly in a position of authority on such matters, and their voice is more valuable on such matters than anyone outside of their group. Whether that's gay men discussing gay rights, sex workers discussing sex work politics, trans people discussing trans issues, etc. For instance, I'm a trans person. There is no cis person alive who knows more about being trans than I do. That's just a cold hard fact, and while there are trans people more knowledgeable than me on a plethora of trans-related topics, no cis person can add more value to such discussions than me. 

It's important to recognize that members of social groups simply know better. So often, this is ignored, and it leads to people outside of marginalized groups attempting to use their privilege and the power of their voice to drown out criticism from minorities. Like, if a black person tells a white person they're being racist against black people, the white person should not challenge that criticism and get defensive...they should accept it, ask how to do better, and take the criticism to heart. Yet, so often, people instead just double down and deny, deny, deny, because they aren't affected by such issues, and can easily walk away. It's important to be mindful and respect those who know better. "
206,"I think there is a difference between policing  what you say and policing who you are. Like, if someone told you that the best way to fit in with their group of friends would be to tone down or police your blackness I have to assume you would be offended, and rightly so. Someone asking you not to mention certain topics is not the same as them asking you to sacrifice part of your identity. At least, that's how I see it. With regards to your other comment:

>Also - honestly, it's not really a two-way street when it comes to racial issues. What meaningful, non-racist critique would a white person have with the way I express my blackness?

I don't suggest that a white person critique the way you express your blackness but rather you also be open to discover how they choose to express their whiteness. It seems to me that many people see white culture as something that everyone already is familiar with and thus requires no further exploration because its the dominant culture. But our shared culture, let's say as Americans, or World citizens to be more inclusive, is not one for one the same as white culture. All I'm saying is, that in a friendship, or any other personal relationship, across racial lines, it is helpful to express/explore racial identity and culture together.
"
207,">Let's go back to my initial question. Would you have been more comfortable if the author had written, ""While around POC, be prepared to codeswitch?"" If so, do you think she should've written that instead of ""Proximity to Blackness is not an excuse to NOT police your whiteness""?

Yes. Being white, much like being black or latino or asian or etc., is something you're born into, and expressing that part of yourself is not necessarily blameworthy. When the author uses that terminology it seems to imply that ""whiteness"" is inherently wrong in some way and should be ""policed"" less it offend. So yes, I had a problem with the language and the racially insensitive concept it implied especially in the context of a friendship; code-switching would have been a much better term and sentiment."
208,"I find it interesting that, being trans person, you used this example:

> And if you're cis and your drag queen friends use the T or S word, then you shouldn't use those word

I am also trans, and while I understand drag queen struggle with gender non-conformity and similar hate that we trans people do, that still doesn't give them the right to use a potentially triggering, offensive and hateful slur that is aimed at trans people. It bothers me how many drag queens that I know and the ones that are on TV can use the word so numerously and flippant. While they are out there, actually trans people who use the word are in a far minority in my experience. These are just my personal opinions though, what do you think?
"
209,What do you think white culture is? 
210,"You seem to take issue with the idea that ""whiteness"" is inherently wrong; it isn't, no, but this is *exactly* the mentality that POC have faced throughout American history. We still get it. Every single day, we're reminded of our ""otherness."" 

The phrasing made me uncomfortable, too, but it was an effectively calculated statement that made its point very clearly, and I think that that would've been lost if the author had chosen to use ""codeswitching"" because s/he didn't want to make anyone uncomfortable. "
211,"I've long since come to the realization that the drag community will not let go of those words. However, in the past few years in my city, after a lot of outreach and discussions, basically all the big-name drag performers here keep those words within their spaces, and even then it's largely limited to outside of their performances. It's not much of a win, but it HAS helped tone down the use of those slurs by drag performers and other cis folk. At least, I've noticed it, and others in my community have noticed the drop in those slurs in LGBT spaces, so it's a start.

My larger concern, given how stubborn drag queens are at letting go of that language, is their audience, and their friends, thinking it's okay to use those words because drag performers do. Again, maybe the queens in my area are just more reasonable than normal, but they've helped with education over the past few Pride weeks on that topic, informing people that they're slurs not meant for folks to use unless you're part of a select community, and even then, it should be limited (while me and other trans folks have done our workshops saying it's a slur that no one should use, but at least there's some progress happening).

It's not a perfect approach. I hate those words, and I don't like how drag performers can just throw the words around and walk away from them when they return to their real lives, leaving trans people as the sole visible targets of them. It's not right, it's not fair, but I'm hoping that just focusing on telling cis folk not to use them, and getting the drag community to slowly shift away from those words, will help eradicate their usage in common vocabularies. Because from my experience, it's not the drag queens throwing those slurs at me, it's everyday cis folk who think it's totally okay to call me those, so if we can get drag performers to help educate the masses that no, those words aren't acceptable, then I think that will make a bigger difference than railing against a super stubborn drag community. "
212,"Country music, cheesy mac, and Republicanism. You know, white people stuff. And I think you meant to say European-American culture. ;)

In all seriousness though, there are plenty of things considered to be ""white"" that many POC are unfamiliar with. My point was that  a friendship should allow for the sharing of lived experiences in a space where those experiences are considered equally valuable, at least to the people sharing them."
213,[deleted]
214,That's a fair and pragmatic take on things. Thanks for sharing 
215,"I don't disagree.

You said
>But our shared culture, let's say as Americans . . . is not one for one the same as white culture

which implied that you thought there was some distinct white culture. There isn't. There is, as you later noted, European-American culture in all its different iterations, but that's not white. Benjamin Franklin's definition of whiteness consisted of the English and the Germans who were not ""swarthy."" Whiteness is a club, and the French, Spanish, Irish, and others earned their whiteness by proving they were willing to uphold the status quo (racism - anti-black racism, specifically). 

When you police whiteness, you are policing an identity formed through domination, exploitation, genocide, and more. That's why there is no ""white pride."" Share your European culture with me - whether it's kilts or haggis (actually don't share haggis) or baklava or pierogies or schnitzel or quiche or fettuccine - but that stuff predates whiteness and is not exclusive to white people. Sometimes we'll call those things ""white"" colloquially, but castigations of whiteness are never aimed at normal, non-harmful expressions of national or ethnic identities."
216,"I'm sorry you've experienced that. :( Honestly, LGB folks who use those words know what they're doing, and that's just...heinous. My local GSM community's been pretty great at basically blacklisting folks in the community who are terrible, and I've seen a lot of cis gay dudes get excluded for such jackassery (they're given chances to do better and apologize, but a lot just take offense that they're being asked to).  I'd like to see that happen elsewhere, tbh.

And yeah, a lot of hetero cis folk say them out of ignorance, but I've found a lot let those words bypass previous teachings from trans friends over teminology. Like, a good friend of mine came out as trans two years ago, and things were swimmingly with her friends until a few of them decided that 'trans woman' was too boring, and that the T and S words were better and more fun. I've dealt with similar issues with friends in the past, and it took weeks and weeks to get them to realize that no, those words are not to be used, yes we're serious, yes they're slurs, and no, drag queens aren't the same as trans women. We've both had friends who were quick to correct themselves, but we both dealt with a number who just had great difficulty believing we were serious when RuPaul and co (and/or local drag artists) used those words so often. A lot of the time, cis folk will be more keen to listen to other cis people on how to talk to and refer to trans people, and that's why my community has pushed so hard to get local drag stars on our side and educate, because folks tend to listen to them more than they listen to us, and if the drag folk are educating using our words, then...well, that's better than the alternative. "
217,"They neglected her while she was in their custody. The police were supposed to at least check on her hourly, and they wouldn't even do that. They also mistreated her prior to that.

218,"She was arrested under highly questionable circumstances in the first place, and between the shoddy record keeping at the jail and obvious evidence of a tampered scene, the events surrounding her death are far from clear."
219,"**EDIT: Many people have gotten upset over this post, so in light of that I want to remind everyone that in the future we should at least do a quick Google search on the matter at hand before asking questions that could be considered ignorant or condescending. This has been added to the Rules & Regulations. I hope we can keep AllWomen intersectional and comfortable this way.**

Most people are saying that she didn't commit suicide (including her own mother) but was actually murdered by the police and was already dead in her mugshot. [The arrest video itself](http://wgntv.com/2015/07/25/new-dash-cam-video-shows-another-view-of-sandra-blands-arrest/) also brought up plenty of controversy, showing a cop pulling Sandra out of her car and pinning her to the ground for failing to use a turn signal, though she was not actually told by the officer at any point why she was being arrested. 

There are many reasons to believe that she was dead in her mugshot. [This person's father, training to be a mortician, points out a few of those reasons.](http://cishits.tumblr.com/post/124797471103/ayoaprell-gimmeallyoresidualz-shinkoukei) CONTENT WARNING on that link for a photo of Bland's possibly dead body. It's also worth acknowledging that when you get a mugshot taken, it gets taken in the clothes you were arrested in, and they will tell you not to lean against the wall and look directly at the camera. 

The police also claim that she hung herself from a 5-foot platform with a trash bag from the trash can in her cell. She was 6 feet tall, and trashcans are not allowed in cells because they can't be bolted to the floor. In the photo of the cell after her death, there is a trash bag in the trashcan that seems to have replaced the one she allegedly used, even though police say the scene was not tampered with before the photo (which would include a trash bag being replaced). Sandra told her sister on the phone that she thinks her shoulder is broken, which would have affected her ability to tie anything high enough to hang herself from. "
220,There is no possible scenario in which the police are not directly responsible for her death.
221,"I saw the arrest tape. If what she did warrants being arrested then I should have been arrested at least three times myself. There is no proof in that video she kicked the officer. Furthermore she was in the custody of the state which means they were responsible for her safety. Without the wrongful arrest she would most likely be alive today. If one of your loved ones committed suicide in police custody after a wrongful arrest would you just say ""whelp, no harm no foul""? This is pretty basic stuff. Would you also like to know why black people can say the N-word and we can't? "

No need to be rude."
232,"Agreed, according to the posts, there is some serious shit that the mainstream media left out."
233,This is not a sub where you want to be making arguments that people in oppressed groups don't get treated poorly as a result of their membership in those groups. I've removed this comment. Please avoid doing this in the future.
234,"That's actually one of the *least* sketchy parts about the case. I definitely agree it looks suspicious, and I don't trust the police, at all.

But it's definitely possible to hang yourself from something shorter than your body. You don't need to actually be hanging from the ceiling. You can tie the noose around your neck and then just let your legs go limp, and fall. If your feet aren't supporting your body, then all of your weight is pulling down on the noose around your neck, and this could kill you unless your butt reaches the ground. (Sorry I know that's a gruesome thing to imagine). "
235,"Yeah, sure - but on the other hand, this is a pretty google-fu level question and seems pretty disrespectful.  Like, come on people.  Can't we do five minutes of research before asking these kinds of insulting questions about black people getting murdered by our police force?"
236,"I think it's important for you to consider what sources and news outlets your information comes from, and to look at everything you read with a critical eye.  Are your sources known to be credible?  Is the headline phrased as a question or clickbait?  

The reason why you've gotten responses that haven't been the friendliest possible is that there's been a shitstorm brewing over Ms. Bland's death and the questionable circumstances and incomplete documentation that surround it.  It's been hard to miss without ignoring relevant news.  

Before posting to ask ""What am I missing?"", something must've made you think that there were parts of the story you hadn't heard.  What sorts of questions popped up in your mind that drove you to ask about Ms. Bland's death?  Not to put too fine a point on it, but why come here asking about it first instead of looking further into it on your own?  Curiosity is a terrific thing, and knowing what questions to ask and where to turn to find answers is an invaluable life skill.  I don't want you to be discouraged from asking questions, but I do think you should try to find better places to begin looking for answers. :)"
237,"I understand where you're coming from and I agree with you: it would be better for people to try to explore issues on their own before starting discussions about them, like doing the reading for a class before you get there and try to ask a question or start a discussion.  (And just like the class, there'll always be people who don't do the reading, and you know there's always at least one who starts talking anyway...)

So we have two options: embarrass or educate.  Embarrassing someone over a question you find insensitive makes them feel bad and also doesn't inform them of anything.  I can handle people feeling bad, but given the nature of this sub (respectful discussion, openness, civility), I think it's better to be polite and ignore questions that get your back up.  Your time is your own, and it's valuable, so it's worth thinking about whether or not you want to use (or waste, depending on how you look at things) it on writing a response to a question that's not sitting right with you.  Someone else will hopefully tackle it for you, or it'll be left for long enough that you have the opportunity to burn off some of the immediate anger towards the poster and let the anger about the injustice take over when you do write a response.

The other option is to educate.  Lay out the information in a way that encourages the person asking the question to take it in, process it, and understand it—calling someone's question bad puts them on the defensive and shuts them down to discussion.  When a person's mis- or mal-informed, this is absolutely not what I want to see happen.  The cost is too high: we need more people standing with us, not writing us off as nasty, angry people and discounting what we have to say.  

Lastly, I'd like you to keep Hanlon's razor in mind: ""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.""  In this case, I'd say ignorance and malinformation (not misinformation, which sounds like a mistake) are the issue.  "
238,"It's always on black folks to educate, though.  Is this going to be a safe space for black women?  Or, is it going to be a place where ignorant and frankly tone-policing posters like this person come to get a bandaid on their un-examined ignorance?  Look at the submission, even.  It starts OUT by tone policing.  Oh, ladies, don't jump down my throat!  And then, when people are (quite rightly) a bit put off by this person's attitude, OP gets very self righteous and huffs about it, because ""they were just aaaaaaasking!""

If someone came into /r/rape and posted, ""Hey, ladies, now don't jump down my throat, but I don't know why rape is even a big deal"" - they'd be banned in a heartbeat.  It's not the place for it.  So my question is, is this the place for it?  Is this where we get to come to feel like we're obligated to scrape and kiss ass to people who clearly didn't even attempt to inform themselves?  Because that's not a place where I want to be.  Even SRSD won't stoop that low.

And please spare me the condescension. 

*Edit - I would like to mention that I am Latina, for transparency."
239,Thank you for this 
240,"A white person's never going to fully understand what it's like to be black (or any person of color), no matter how much reading they do, how many rallies they go to, or how angry they get over the injustices that are common in our culture.  Whatever they try to do to immerse themselves in the culture of minorities, they'll always go home at the end of the day/week/month and go back to being treated with the privilege white people have.  That's why it's on us, on people of color, to do our best to educate—because we DO live with it 24/7, and we have a different perspective that they never will, whether they want it or not.  We don't get the luxury of a respite.  People of color, as shown by police raids in the past (exemplified by the Johnston killing), aren't even safe in their own homes.  We're responsible for doing the best we can to educate in order to produce change, because no one else can do it for us and shit is unacceptable right now.  

I agree that tone-policing is bullshit.  I always ignore it—if someone doesn't want people to get upset, then they always have the option of keeping their yaps closed and not asking insensitive questions.  If they want to feel like they can ask any question at all, they need to be prepared for the answers they're gonna get.  As you'll see in my response to OP, I pointed out that this was not the best place to ask a question like that.  I'm sure you've encountered that kind of gritted-teeth diplomacy before: ""not the best place"" means ""you have no idea how wrong you were to post this question here and I'm silently judging you for it.""  Yes, I was put off by the post, too.  I did my best to address the issue/question itself; I'm not interested in trying to make people feel better about asking dumb questions, but I'm also trying to phrase information in a way that doesn't raise hackles—information generally gets ignored when people feel like they're being attacked, and to me, the information is the important part.

I'm sorry I came across as condescending.  I was aiming for ""diplomatic"" and ""practical,"" but clearly missed.  (I am not a diplomatic person by nature.)  Ultimately, what I don't want is for someone to come in, ask a question, and leave with a bunch of, ""I can't believe you just asked that.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Jesus christ, you're being serious"" kinds of responses and **no information**.  Without a moderator hat on, I can say that I'm fine with the ""are you fucking kidding me?!"" posts.  With the hat, I dunno.  On the one hand, it's disrespectful to the person asking the question; on the other, the original question was really disrespectful to us.  It seemed straight up lazy to ask, ""What's the big deal about Sandra Bland?"" without trying to find anything out beforehand.  I mean, this is a sub about intersectional feminism, there should probably be an existing base of knowledge that includes the way the justice system is stacked against people of color and the poor.  So no, I can't fully answer that part of your post.  You aren't obligated to make nice with anyone you feel is insulting you, but you also don't owe them a response.  Like I said, your time is valuable—if you feel like you'd be wasting your time by typing out an informative response, you don't owe anyone the effort, least of all someone who wasn't even willing to come prepared to a discussion.  That's not intended to be a dig of any kind towards you, it really is just a suggestion that you not blow your time and effort on someone you don't think would benefit from it."
241,"Thanks for the extensive reply, I read and appreciate it.  I think many years of redditing has left me slightly less willing to suspend my suspicions that people are either lazy, or concern trolling - especially about race.  God, the record this place has on race.  And the amount of entitled people who think that when they do come with the tone hat on, and tsk tsk at all the POC who are sick and tired of being treated like some kind of zoo display that interacts when you press the ""so how does it really feel to be x?  [please answer with, oh white person you are so nice to even ask this!]"" is completely astounding.

I don't want people to just get scolded out of the sub *for innocent questions.*  But with my mod hat on?  This smelled a bit rotten.  To me, the best course here would be what they did end up doing, stickying a post at the top that this question should have had a little more thought behind it, and that it's not appropriate to be huffy with people who expect a little more of OP than a baldly lazy hot-button submission.

I don't think I believe in the idea that a person who comes to another group with an ""educate me"" question has any right to demand respect, past the respect accorded to any human being (that is, no threats on their safety or anonymity).  Asking a dumbass question from a group that is answering you, if at all, out of the goodness of their heart?  That person hasn't *earned* my respect.  

Shit is truly unacceptable right now.  Sometimes I feel like breaking down and crying.  It's so unacceptable.  I do think there are ways and places to educate.  But I also think there are limits, and like I said... this place has jaded my willingness to extend those when something seems fishy."
242,"Haha yeah, the default subs, especially their comments, are kind of like the Bog of Eternal Stench from Labyrinth, just a huge cesspool of jackholes, and some of the smaller ones are way worse.  Point taken!

The people who show up and ask questions are only owed polite or civil comments because it was mentioned explicitly in the sidebar.  You're right, respect is earned, and I should've found a better way to phrase it.  I've edit the sidebar to reflect that, and appreciate you bringing it up.  

America (I'm assuming you're American, too, but please correct me if I'm off) is in a bad state.  Police brutality and overreach, given how disproportionately people of color are affected, are definitely things to be angry about.  It's okay to give in and cry every now and then **as long as you get back up and are ready to go another round after**.  Crying about it isn't a sign of weakness, not any more than being frustrated and pissed would be weak.  It's just an outlet.  Anyone can start off fighting, but only the strongest will get back up every time they've been knocked down.  We're in this and we'll see it through.  There are a lot of us, and we each have our strengths.  Some people will take posts like these and answer the question as best as possible; some people will be better at calling out those who are just trolling.  None of us has to do it all.

243,"Ah, you're a mod *here*.  That changes the way that I interpret your tone a bit.  Yeah, I'm an American.  Trying to work for change in whatever way I can in my community but it does feel awfully futile sometimes.  Fortunately I have a pretty good support network and a number of years of therapy under my belt, heh.  Having that backup is so critical when you take a hit."
