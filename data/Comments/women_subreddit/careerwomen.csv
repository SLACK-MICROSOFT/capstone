0,"I think you should wait. Before you make any decisions, though, inform the other company of your fear. See what their answer is and just have as much information going forward to support whatever decision you make. Is the position well funded? How can the pandemic affect their operations? What about your own company and current position?"
1,"I think this is good advice and reasonable questions to ask.  My firm was on the cusp of hiring a couple of people just a week ago, but we had to put the brakes on offers to them and call off the head hunter for a while.  The company might be grateful to have a chance to pause the offer."
2,"If you have gotten feedback (whether fair or not) of being perceived as moody when speaking up, there is an opportunity to have a more focused conversation. Schedule some time with him to sit down and have a discussion. 
Practice with a friend or trusted colleague in advance so you are as calm as possible. 
You can start by saying - ‘This is a difficult conversation for me to have’ which sets the tone that it is serious but professional. 
Share some context of what you’ve noticed (focus on the action as much as possible and not on placing judgment on the person) and explain how it makes you feel when he does that kind of behaviour. 

Then ask for his perspective. Truly listen and try to understand. You might be surprised about what was driving his behaviour. 
After you’ve listened, share back your understanding. 
Discuss how the two of you might approach this moving forward - what can you do, what can he do, do you want to check in in a month? 

If genuine, you can be sure to share at the beginning of the conversation how you appreciate that he is engaged in your performance and in coaching you."
3,"I did have a one on one with him and it unfortunately lead to another manager speaking to me one on one in a belittling manner. I’m not sure if it was on the other manager’s behalf or if that’s how this manager thinks I should be spoken to. So I decided to keep my thoughts to myself. But from your response I can see that I didn’t ask why. since he always explains his POV, I’ve grown quite tired of hearing his perspective without much context. Maybe that’s where this is getting icky. But how much patience can I have? At some point isn’t the manager just being excessive?"
4,"Hi! Normally I’d suggest you quit and focus on yourself, it’s somebody else’s business and you shouldn’t sacrifice your career for it. However, I can see how you have a special attachment to it, and how they were kind (also in need, but hey) to hire you back. What I’d do is be transparent with them, tell them your situation, and they’d definitely understand that you need to pay your bills. 
I’d try to stay until they’ve found somebody good enough for the job and keep the company alive. Also, if that makes you feel better, you can also refer some people, or even ask your college professors for a good student that is in the situation you were in the beginning. 

Hope this helps!"
5,Thank you so much! Those are some good ideas I’ll definitely try to implement
6,"Sounds like your boss and his family made a series of decisions in their best interest: moving far away, getting married, buying a house, starting a family. If I were you I would follow suit--  what decision is in the best interest of you and your life? For example, if this job is draining you of time and energy for not much money, you have less time and energy for other people and things in your life. 

If you stay in this job when you don't want to (only because you feel guilty), you are not really in service of the company anyway. There is likely someone else out there that wants and needs this job more. You have to give the company a chance to find that person, even if it causes a temporarily rough transition. 

You might crosspost this to r/codependency for another perspective. 

Good luck! You already know what to do :)"
7,"If you leave, I would offer to train whomever they hire to replace you."
8,Maybe you could feel less guilty if you help them to find a substitute
9,"2 other roles beside software engineers and data scientists are:
- Product Manager. Skill set needed: management skill, understanding of technology and process of making digital products.
- Product designer. Skill set needed: visual design, system design, user research, a bit psychology."
10,"It's a way of putting you in your place not personal or specific to you. I can't tell you how to stop bc every situation different but don't let anybody spin it that you asked for it, deserve it, are too sensitive etc. It's a grade school mentality and lazy. They're trying to pull rank in the cheapest way available. If someone will back you up report it but keep your best interest #1. They not playing fair so protect your neck. Also plan exit strategy but I know you don't always have the option right away"
11,Report it to the HR specialist immediately.
12,"I am in no way saying that sexual harassment is your fault, because it's not. As much as I wish that we loved in a world where sexual harassers were held accountable by others, they aren't. Often, your only option is to report to HR (not always helpful), set boundaries and be vocal when it happens (call people out on it), or quit and go somewhere else. Some industries are much worse than others. Best of luck to you, it sucks out there."
13,"There's a place for HR, egregious cases, but there are also things you can do to change the tone. Find a way to turn all the b.s. comments into a joke. Of course you always have to ask yourself if it's worth it. Do you really want to be in that company/industry? I work as an engineer. So few women in the field. Always out numbered. Eventually I found small groups where I seem to fit better. Men with wives and children they are happy with, seems to be a better environment. My business partner sorta treats me like an equal, sorta like a daughter. He's always looking for win win no matter what the situation. He's just a really good guy. They're out there."
14,Work with less men
15,"This man has zero interest in your career growth. He's literally said he can and will veto any attempt you make to grow or move as long as it's in his interest to do so. 

Honestly I would be preparing my CV and looking outside. But if you have any parental benefits I would stay put until they are no longer relevant."
16,"Sometimes you need to move outside your current employer to advance your career, and it sounds like your current manager has no intention of letting you go anywhere."
17,"I am 50 now and I wrestled with this for a long time. I was top of my class through high school and ""good at math"" so I went into electrical engineering. I shoved myself through a BS and MS. I tried to do a thesis but couldnt get through it, so I just took the test to get the degree. Happy I did that.

I starting volunteering in the foster care system in my early 20s. I've maintained my passion for it, but the system is tough to work in. The top top top people make very good money (should they???) and everybody else makes shit money. I took a job for 2 years as executive director of an agency that did experimental work helping young adults formerly in foster care, it felt meaningful, but was harder and more political than I expected, and the funding ran out, and I went back to engineering to pay off my credit cards.

I volunteered in Junior League for 10 years in there, that was a great experience, I got to meet lots of interesting people and got to try lots of things. Highly recommend.

After all that, I guess I have come to the realization that the best way for me to make money is to work at small engineering companies or startups. And the best way for me to get my fill of community work is to volunteer. I'm currently president of a board of directors for a startup non profit working with young adults formerly in foster care.

I feel I have my life just about optimized. I happy to do everything I have to do right now.

But I couldn't have planned the path. I had to try lots of things. It took me a long time to figure it out.

I think you just gotta get out there and try it. Whatever holds your attention right now. Work your ass off, give it your best, and if you decide for whatever reason to change direction, no worries, just do it."
18,"It doesn't have to be true, but it might be for a little while. I was top of my class in Chemical Engineering. I got a job as an engineer and 6 months in I was looking at going back to school for something else. Then I got a new boss and I didn't hate it anymore. I figured out what I was good at and I slowly worked from being an engineer in the lab to an engineering leader. Then I thought that maybe I wanted to learn about the business world more so I got my company to pay for my MBA. That got me a job doing product management which I hated. Fast forward 9 months and I got a new boss who put me in a different product manager job and I love it! As I find what I like, I move toward that thing and try things out. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it isn't the job but the environment. 

For your paralegal job, case law is rough. Maybe look into something more work-life balance friendly like patent law or copyright law or corporate law. The big thing I would say is that you need to stick with something for a year or two and figure out exactly what it is you don't like about it and what you do like. Then you can make a more informed decision about where you want to go. 

I certainly have hobbies that I love and that I would love to make money off of, but they stay my night and weekend hobbies. I don't think too many people find a job that can financially sustain them and that they would do if they didn't have to work at all. But that doesn't mean you can't love what you do or get enjoyment out of it."
19,"So I am almost 27 now, but when I was in my early 20's, I went through the same thing.  What I will tell you is this: it does get better.

When I graduated from college, I had an entry level job at an insurance company.  I liked it, but I quickly got bored.  I ended up getting promoted to the job I work at now and I absolutely love it.  I make enough money to live comfortably, I leave the office at 4:15 pm everyday (although I definitely have worked my share of 13 hour days during a busier season), and I have solid relationships at work.  I don't spend Sunday dreading Monday.  

What I have learned is work is 100% dependent on who you are, and who you work with.  You can have a 9-5 corporate job that can be very fulfilling if you take it seriously and cultivate meaningful relationships around you.  Also realize that out of ANY career you chose, 30% of the time your job will suck.  Nobody likes their job 100% of the time.

Realize that every job is important, not just the ""helping"" type jobs.  All jobs have to be done by somebody, nobody owes you a job, and your job doesnt make you more or less important than other people.  Working isnt just a ""grind"" it is a way you contribute to the world, just as your life depends on the labor of others.  

If you are experiencing burn out, I would recommend taking a few days off, if feasible.  Sometimes a few days off is just what I need to go back to work ready to focus again."
20,"You don’t want to work in journalism, but it sounds like you enjoy writing and research. What about marketing/communications? Technical writing? B2B media?

You’ve tried a couple of different fields and that to me says you’re open to and capable of learning new subject matter. If you have the writing and communication chops to go with that, there could be opportunities in lots of industries and fields."
21,"I feel like a lot of what we expect from a workplace or a career is romanticized by influencers. I think it is important to develop a realistic outlook. You might love singing, but you might not enjoy having to subject yourself to the demands of the market as a singer. That's the danger of trying to make your passion your career. I recommend watching School of Life, Tim Urban etc on YouTube. They attempt to answer a lot of these existential questions. 

There is something to be said about having more than one stream of income. So, maybe you can try a part time writing stint that's not too demanding. 

A lot of your anxiety could also be because women tend to be more risk averse, whereas men take a lot more risks. I am not sure if this applies to you. But if you are being over cautious, maybe it's helpful to know this. 

I am an attorney practising in South Asia. I agree that work-life balance sucks in most law firms. But I managed to find a place that works for me. Look at places that consistently promote women (see the ratio of female to male partners). I find that places which are more diverse in their workforce give better work-life balance, and are generally less toxic.

Please know that all of us go through a shitty career phase. But we do come out of it with more clarity and resilience. Best of luck!"
22,Thank you for sharing your story. This has been the hardest 3 years of my life. Trying to manage what work life is supposed to be has left me in complete despair. I’m glad you were able to figure everything out along the way and find a balance between what you love and what you do for work.
23,GREAT share!!!
24,Thank you xx
25,"Most of my moves over the course of my career have been a stretch in some way. I have become more comfortable with the feeling, usually the first year or two are bad, that I could get fired at any time. Once I actually *did* get laid off at the 2 year mark,but other positions have lasted 4-6 years. I say, just stay til you get on top of it or they let you go. Unless you see a better opportunity. :)"
26,"I eventually got used to the idea that if they could have found somebody better for the money they were willing to pay, they would have. For all you know, they are more than aware of the shortcomings in the organization, they just don't frame them that way when they discuss things with you. 

You got this!!!"
27,"Thank you, it feel better knowing I'm not the only one :) I submitted a three-year plan and plan to ride it out, but it just feels yucky right now you know? After reeling from the turnover, it's hard to get settled. But it helps to remember that it's not forever!"
28,Thank you so much!!
29,"Bring it, friend. :)"
30,"I remember someone telling me at work that one guy, who was very smart and hardworking, was laid off because he had a very passive demeanor and they knew he would cause fewer problems than other candidates for the layoff.

I feel for you, I don't know how to deal with the inconsistencies without coming across in a bad light. Seems like you're damned if you do, damned if you don't. Do you have any allies at the management level you could broach the subject with?"
31,"Change your attitude about failure, learn to expect mistakes. When it happens, move forward anyways. Google stories of failure and mistakes by successful people. They all say it is part of their leArning. Failure is nothing to be afraid of"
32,How does this apply to my post?
33,"Is there a third country you could go to that both of you could work in the fields you want? 

Your career is always able to change, but it's going to stick around a lot longer than a partner, probably. I'm a realist - sorry if that's a sad outlook. You're 23! So young. Is this guy forever? Does he make up for the fact you can't have the career you want? It sounds like no. And that's okay! It's okay to decide you want to like your career, even if that means you change your plans with your partner. 

I personally wouldn't give up a career for a partner."
34,"1) I’d say leave that job as soon as possible. 2) you need to set boundaries. Where is this in your job description? Schedule a meeting with your manager right away. Be matter of fact. Take the job description with you and review your duties. Point out that the cleaning duties are not in your job description and you owe it to the company to give good performance in your job, which does not include the cleaning. Make it all about the job, not about personal issues. Any cleaning you do takes away from time you could spend on your job. 
Do not do the cleaning for one more day, stop right now!"
35,"I'll give you my two cents for what it's worth- if a company doesn't value you you enough to give you the opportunity to advance despite your demonstrated willingness to go above and beyond for them, then they aren't worth your time. In this job market there are definitely companies who would value your skill set, would help you to develop the skills you need, and hopefully you can get a bit of a promotion/pay increase in the process."
36,"Thanks for the reply. And I appreciate your input, not sure if your name reflects your location but I'm located in the west of Ireland. Not much of a job market here at my level. I've come to the conclusion I need to strongly push them to put a tangible development path with all related training in place."
37,"I’m probably the opposite of what you’re looking for. Also classically trained with a masters, freelanced semi successfully through my mid 20s and came runner up at a couple auditions and realized i didn’t want it anymore. (An absolutely agonizing decision). Now I have a career in something completely unrelated and I find it more fulfilling that I ever thought I would. I still gig on the side and play several times a week. I know it’s not what you’re looking for, but just here to say that you’ll end up ok no matter which route you take!"
38,"I'm glad to hear you've been able to pivot to something you love! :) What do you do now? 

I've had several friends do the same. Every once in a while I meditate on what I'd like to do if I wasn't doing this, and I have a hard time coming up with an answer. Sometimes I think I'd like to really go whole-hog into my website work, but the old bug to get on stage comes back."
39,"I don’t see it as an either or. I still play and perform a fair bit. I work in communications now. For a long time I dreaded the idea of a desk job and the idea of parting with the “musician” part of my identity was terrifying. In order to break myself out of that mental rut I went back to school for a health science masters (but quit after 2 semesters). But it was enough to rattle me out of the “I’m either a musician or not and I could never have a desk job” mindset. I had been doing a bit of communications on the side while freelancing so when I quit school it was a natural thing to fall back into and I’m lucky that I like it! I actually like it more now that I’ve decided that it’ll be my main career, like I can direct more energy into it.  Obviously not everyone is going to have the same experience. But for me, just trying stuff was the best way to find out what I liked."
40,"Hey,

I think we all suffer from imposter syndrome from time to time and that’s natural. Take comfort in the fact that the company thought you were good enough to hire—they believe in you so you should too. Also find what you consider good writing and study it. Maybe that’s reading The New Yorker or The Atlantic and take what you like from it. Build your vocab. Read blogs about writing, I think the more effort you put into improving the less guilty or bad you’ll feel because you’ll have tangible things you’re doing. And also were never as bad as we think we are. Good luck!"
41,"Can you take a class on Linked In Learning, or other online platform? That will increase your confidence"
42,"Fuck, that's awful, I would kindly decline and maybe just say you got another offer that you're excited about? Did he seem odd, what prompted you to research him?

Edit: I wanted to add, I personally wouldn't say anything to him about what you found out. I would just keep it short and direct, and hope you never hear from him ever again."
43,"Can you decline the offer saying that you need health insurance or better benefits because of your family? 

Thanks for the opportunity but after talking it over with my (family/husband/boyfriend), I don’t think this position will work for us. I really like the position but after running the numbers, I can’t afford to take the position without health insurance (or this salary/hours/whatever)."
44,"One concern is the next person who ends up in your position, but doesn't Google him and accepts the possibly bogus contractor work...."
45,Changing your number should be easy as far as the address thing... Even I'm curious about the options. Did you give him a work address hopefully? In hindsight asking for your address is bizarre for an NDA...
46,"You could ask him what happened. But you can also just say you've found another position and are going to go with other opportunities. 

> And, unfortunately, he has my address and cell phone #.

That's largely public info that anyone could find by googling your name and digging if they felt so inclined, I wouldn't worry about that."
47,"you should talk to him about it first, tell him that you know and you wanna know what happens. If he was a monster he would be in prison so he probly hasn’t committed a crime since. It’s not hard to get on that list. Sex offender have the lowest recidivism rate. How old is he, might have been a dumb teen doing dumb shit. Gotta talk to him to find out."
48,[deleted]
49,Straight up tell him you found out he's a registered sex offender and that you will be finding another position.
50,"It wasn't just one thing, it was a bunch of little things.  That and he seemed too interested in my help and I'm still a student, literally learning this particular programming language this semester.   That and he didn't seem to know that you can get a debugger for this programming language.  I dunno.  That's when I thought I should google a little more."
51,It was just a side gig/consulting job.  I'll just tell him my day job needs me available for overtime hours or something.
52,"I told the person at the school who forwarded me the  email re the job.  Hopefully he'll tell the other woman who was bcc-ed on the email, I don't have her contact info."
53,"The whole thing was just bizarre.  No, unfortunately it's my home address. Thankfully my area is well lit and my neighbors are mostly retirees who are are home all the time."
54,Nah.  It's too disturbing and none of my business.  I'd rather avoid the whole subject.
55,"No.  I don't want to know.  It's none of my business.  And he was over the age of 45 when convicted of the kidnapping and rape.  Whether he's actually guilty or not, reformed or not, doesn't matter.  It's just too much risk and not worth it."
56,"I mostly agree with this. Weirdly enough it's easy to get on that list but it's also very easy to get away with a slap on the wrist. A lot of ""monsters"" only have to serve a few years in jail and are then released back to society... and many times they attack again. 

I think the important thing for OP right now is to find out exactly what the charge was. Idk if I'd ask him, but there must be some legal way for OP to know the details to see exactly what she's willing to accept or not."
57,Nevermind.  I figured it out.  No.  Not doing that.  It's not about whether I'm in the wrong.   I'm allowed not to accept a job.  You're not obligated because there's been an offer.
58,What's that?
59,I'd prefer not making him mad.  I don't want him to fixate on me.  He lives within 2 miles of my home.
60,"Yeah, you should trust your instincts on this, and it sounds like everything is saying don't do it, don't ask about it, just decline, have a good solid reason that he can't question just in case."
61,That's completely fair. I would definitely do the same. Could you tell him you don't think you can balance that project with school right now? (Or something like that?)
62,Fear and bias over facts.. you should care if he’s guilty or not it wouldn’t be to hard for you or you family to get on the list especially if guilt not even a factor.
63,"It's public record.  I already know.  It's kidnapping and rape.  And he was over the age of 45 when convicted.  Guilty or not, reformed or not, I can't take that risk.  It's not fair to my family."
64,"That’s not true, the media only cover sex offenders that are vary heinous or reoffended what they won’t show you is sex offenders that feel guilt and shame even with these feeling they started there own business, they kinda have too since there is so much stigma . Not mention their family, quite a bit of them have spouses and kids and start over with no invade ya. Subreddit sex offender support is full of bs these people have to go throu. Absolutely some are psyopathic monster. Sex offender registry is failing for the simple reason by one convicted of a sex crime is on the list it could be as simple as an 15 year old autistic slaps a girl on the ass, should he really have to suffer a life of discrimination because his parents didn’t teach him any better I don’t think so."
65,"Just did a bit more research into the thing he said he needed help with...  It's bogus.

I should have known when the story shifted during the interview.  First it was dev work on a plugin.  Then it was that a plugin his client had bought and customized was injected with malware.  Did some digging - that plugin he mentioned is a malicious plugin that infects wordpress sites.  O.o  This is not a dev job.  I'm learning PHP this semester.  I'm not a wordpress expert.  I'm not infosec.  I'm a student.  I dunno how this slipped under the radar - it was my school that passed on the job ""posting"".  -\_-"
66,"Look, the guy didn't know debuggers were available for this programming language, I don't think he knew how to set up his development environment,  and he seemed to eager for my help though I'm a student and just learning this particular programming language this semester.   Too many red flags for someone who holds himself out as a developer.  I have my family to think about.  Besides, there's probably someone much more qualified out there."
67,"Yep, I'd do the same as you. The easiest way may just be to say you received a better offer from another job and that while ""it sucks & seems like bad timing"" you can't reject the better offer. Thank him for his time and be done with it."
68,"I think your point about the frailty of life is well taken. I wouldn't recommend working 24/7 for the rest of your life. However, your ability to perform (academically and in real life) is of paramount, utmost importance during your four years of medical school as that is what will dictate the rest of your career (internship / residency placements or matches) which directly affects your earning potential and future work/life balance. 

Working all the time isn't sustainable, but is largely required and expected during the four years of medical school and early residency. It's a pretty straightforward fact that this won't leave you much time for socializing. Sounds like your family and boyfriend's expectations need to be level-set. 

This isn't forever, but it is for now, and it serves a very important purpose for you.

Also - you cannot live your life based on ""what if"". You have to make decisions for yourself and for your future with the best information *you have at the time*. You're looking at all this with a retrospective lens, and that's not a fair assessment. You cannot predict the future."
69,"I wish he’d said “you’re burned out and I’m worried about you” instead of “complaining you can’t hang out,” but it seems like you’re finding some balance and that’s okay. You must have been working hard in school for years to get to this point, and it’s absolutely okay to create boundaries. I started saying no to things that would have been nice to do that I could have accomplished with extra strain, and what happened is I was able to enjoy life while doing better with my existing commitments, focusing on them and being/feeling better across the board.

Just make sure you’re feeling this way on your own - it’s okay if he sparked the thought - and not justifying something he pushed for selfishly. Also maybe think about why you’re asking this - do you not want to hear what your friends are saying? Or are you aware of their and your inclination to reject anything that comes with feminist guilt? Hard to phrase but I know a lot of powerful women who ostensibly would never put a man first, but sometimes they do put their relationship first as a way of protecting an essential and valued partnership. I think a lot of us wish we could avoid anything that feels rooted in a patriarchal tradition, but compromises make sense in a lot of people’s real lives - like, I’m the more efficient chef between me and my boyfriend so I cook more often, and that’s okay because it’s what works, even though my mom always drilled it into me that I didn’t have to cook for a man.

Idk, I know this isn’t an answer, but I think you just need to get in touch with how you feel and why you feel that way. At a crossroads and after a loss, however close, I’m a big fan of short term therapy, especially if you have a little bit of extra time now. If anything it can help you enjoy the time with your boyfriend while keeping any guilt at bay. But overall I think it can feel weird and uncomfy to start taking care of yourself, and that may just be what you’re experiencing."
70,"It’s good to be sensitive to this, but depending on your workplace I think most managers will try to be accommodating.  If your performance and attendance is otherwise good it should be bad to bring this up. My advice is to explain to your manager:

-  an important one in a lifetime opportunity has come up for you and you’ve been  given a scholarship to participate. (I personally would avoid the details on what the opportunity is, just that it’s a learning and development event)

- it would involve taking X days on Y timeframe. You have enough PTO to do it but take your job very seriously and don’t want it to reflect poorly on you 

- you hadn’t planned on it, and you know it’s very early in your employment. but would like to see if it’s an option to participate 

- offer to work extra to prepare, work out a coverage plan and/or be on call, depending on what your position is

- reiterate that you are really enjoying and appreciating your job and don’t want this to jeopardize your job or perception of you 

Also see if there’s anything specific going on at your workplace during that time (eg, other PTO, big deadlines, etc. to try to anticipate your managers concerns.) they may also offer to give you 1 day instead of 3 so think about if that’s an option for you. 

A good manager should support you in this. Assuming it works out, after the event, make sure to share your appreciation for their flexibility and support. 

Good luck!"
71,"You earned the time off, don't be shy to take it - especially if there are no official rules.  If it is looked down upon, then there should be some kind of rule that discusses the first available usage of PTO after hire.  Besides, you will be there for 2 months already and you're only taking 3 days off, which is really not a lot of time. Have a great time on your trip!"
72,I’d do ear buds so I can be interrupted. Welcoming but also considerate.
73,Yes
74,"I think it’s totally ok to close your office door whenever you need privacy or time for not being interrupted.  I would close it and then just open it again when you are done. If you are in the happier of opening and closing regularly, people tend to respect it when it’s closed."
75,Use headphones
76,Social worker?
77,"I do lots of volunteer work in the foster care system, and I have found that some of the most effective and compassionate people in that system have special needs children. Having children with special needs seems to make a person exceptionally well suited to work with kids in foster care, where deficiencies are hard to see but are very real.

The foster care system in my area doesnt seen to require specific education, and there are lots of different types of positions."
78,"As someone who works in finance but at a company that has a purpose that I believe in I wanted to mention that you could consider using your experience in finance to get yourself a job somewhere that feels worthwhile to work. It makes it a lot more fulfilling to do that kind of work when you believe in the overall goal.

89,"Hi, my background is in Structural Engineering.  I have probably an atypical story, but I work in building inspections and travel frequently.  My work-life balance is amazing.  We have no set work hours or vacation/PTO.  We can work remotely.  They trust me to simply get my work done.  

Because I inspect, I’m outside during the day, I walk a ton (and climb steps/access ladders), so I’m fairly active.  I have a standing desk for when I’m at work.  

Because I travel, I get to enjoy different cities/states/countries (I live in cold climate).  We keep our own airlines miles, hotel points and credit card cash back.  We get food stipends.  

I actually left my company a few years back and switched to ‘conventional’ structural design, and while I loved the challenge of the work and the subject matter, the switch to desk-sitting, office-lighting, no-sunlight-having, day in and day out wasn’t a good fit and I didn’t stay long.  I easily reclaimed my position at my inspection company, and made ‘senior engineer’ a few months after.

At my design job, I felt bogged down by all the small changes and red tape and ‘shifting the responsibility’ between fabricators, contractors, architects, other specialities on projects. I’d re-design the same connections over and over because a base plate was moved 2” by the arch.  Frustrating.  But it could have been my aggressive firm specifically.

As an aside, at least in the US, you only need a Masters to teach as an adjunct professor in college, and I moonlighted as an Engr prof for a few years. Such rewarding work, I miss it dearly.  An especially good fit if you’re more interested in the theory rather than the practice of engineering.

If you have more questions, I’m happy to help!"
90,"I have an MSEE and I write embedded firmware for a living.

I like startups. The hours are terrible, but I want the chance at a big payoff (from stock options or intellectual property).

I know a female MSME that works at a defense co. and she is able to work a 32 hour work week with full time benefits, and she has 2 children and a very supportive husband, honestly she seems to have it all.

I would have a hard time with children and these startup hours. I wouldn't be able to do it. I need big chunks of quiet time to think and work on issues. If I have a complicated bug, I dont want to have to stick to an outside schedule, I want to be able to stay all night to keep the same train of thought if I want to."
91,Thank you very much. Did you work for private/consulting or for the public sector?
92,How much do you work per week? Is the salary and benefits good? Also where are you from
93,"Private, we prepare capital repair and replacement schedules for buildings."
94,"I'm in Florida, Space Coast, we have a fair amount of tech here.

I have 30 years experience. Right now I make $60/hour. Last year I had 2 small contracts the I had to buy material for, I had my highest grossing year ever, $145K, and I paid myself a salary of $80K and after I paid my taxes I left the rest in the company. 

This money is ok, not terrible, not amazing. But I only have a 15 min commute and I work about 45 hours a week.

Before this contract, I worked on a product for 4 years for a startup. I got paid $8K per month no matter how many hours I worked. For the first 2 years I worked up to 80 hours per week. For the last 2 years i worked 30-40 hours per week. But I own the code I wrote for that project.

The big payoff for me will be if the customer is successful with that product and they have to come back to me for changes or they decide to buy the sourcecode. It could potentially be something like...5% of gross revenue for that and all similar products for the life of the patent (20 years). This could turn into something like $200K/year for years for no additional work. That's the kind of payout I hope to get someday. Either on that project or something like it.

I know men that do similar work that get paid $100/hour. Are they overpaid? Am I underpaid? I honestly don't know. It's hard to compare. I am good at some things, not so good at others, it's hard to find someone that has your *exact* skillset to compare salary/rate with.

My belief has come to be...you can't wait for someone to pay you what you're worth. Your worth is what you can get because they *need* what you have and they can't get it anywhere else. For example, on my last project, if they decide they don't want to pay me a big lump sum, or they don't want to pay me royalties, they will have to rewrite the code for the product from scratch using programmers that give them a better deal than what I want. They may decide to do that, but it will set them back. It probably wouldnt take a new person the whole 4 years to rewrite it, since they have a working product in front of them they should be able to do it faster, maybe 2 years? I did some of this type of rewrite work at GE a while back, it can be done, but it's also difficult to get all the details right.

Anyway, that's what's involved with that kind of negotiation."

97,"> but the lifestyle of a dentist is better

Uhhh, says who? I'm in the US, so I can't speak to the cost in your country. However, dental school in the US has the highest debt of any specialty, well into $500k, and you basically have to start your own practice and run it until you retire. Dental school is also *hard*. Personally, I don't find the idea of running a business (and the additional debt it'll take to start one since you'll have no capital and only debt when you graduate) to be fun or a better lifestyle. 

You don't have to be in construction as a civil engineer, either. You don't have to do field work. I have many CivE friends that don't go into the field. You can do a *lot* of things with an engineering degree that have nothing to do with what you studied in school. You're locked in to one career path with a dentistry degree. 

Engineering - particularly CivE - and dentistry have seemingly no overlap in required skills or fundamental technical aptitudes. I've yet to meet any engineer who gave it up for dentistry. 

> Some engineers talk about being underpaid and overworked or losing interest in the field after a couple years in the industry

The only way to continue to make market rate salary is by changing companies or getting a competing offer and having your employer match it. That's well known. If these people are complaining they aren't at market value after being in the same job/company for 3-5 years... well that's their fault, imo."
98,"Yes dental school is more expensive. That was a huge concern for me however, I met with a dentist who graduated 3 years ago from my university and she said that the debt is quite manageable. The engineers going into dentistry is what I've seen from various online forums. Basically what I want to know is several years down the line, what career will be the better choice. I want to know if my expectations of the career are inaccurate."
99,"> The engineers going into dentistry is what I've seen from various online forums

I think you've got some confirmation bias going there and want someone to tell you what to do. None of us can - that's for you to decide. 

> however, I met with a dentist who graduated 3 years ago from my university and she said that the debt is quite manageable.

I think making this decision on an n=1 is a bad idea. Run the numbers yourself.

102,"Earlier this year I had the opportunity for a lateral move - while my job title/pay stayed the same, I moved from the customer service team to the CEO office and my day-to-day job duties are very different. Before I worked directly with teams and staff members on small projects, now I'm working directly with the executive team on enterprise wide strategy. I'm happy I did it, and every situation is different.

I'm still fairly early in my career, so ultimately I decided to take it as I'm trying different things out and seeing how I enjoy working at different levels of an organization. While I was considering the opportunity the best advice I got that really stuck with me was that I should make sure I'm running *toward* something and not *away.* I did have challenges with my prior team so I wanted to make sure I wasn't only looking for an escape but building on what I learned about who I was and what I wanted to do. Somewhere else I heard that if you don't know what your passion is {yet} just follow your curiosity. My current position wasn't fitting my needs, and I knew I needed to keep learning more about what I can do, so I followed my curiosity. It's working out well.

Best of luck with your decision! You'll make the right decision for where you are now 😊"
103,Really appreciate your response.  That line about moving towards and not running from is spot on.  I’m about 10 years into my career and I think I can automatically take one of the new options off my list.  It would derail my current path and make it hard to get back in.  My second option would take me away from the strategic position I’m in and focus more on chief of staff problem solving.   Also very different than I am doing now but would work entirely with the executive team on large business wide implementation projects.  More exposure for future opportunities.  I’m trying to break into the director level and it’s a small window.  I’m so glad your move was right for you!  I need to keep thinking about what I want.
104,It really depends on the work place. Usually jeans are a no go for business casual. Go for dress pants at least the first couple days and reevaluate once you see what others are wearing
105,"I'd wear black trousers or ponte pants until I got a feel for how ""casual"" the business casual actually is. Some places it means you don't need to wear a skirt suit and heels, other places it means shorts and sandals are ok."
106,"My jobs have all been business casual and I never wear jeans. To be on the safe side, dress up the first week and look to see what others wear"
107,You might want to try nice dark rinse or black jeans with a dressier top until you see what everyone else is wearing.
108,"I’d say no jeans. There are plenty of comfy pull on pants that are also dressy, which you can pair with a nice blouse. Follow the lead of coworkers."
109,"We’ve all been there! A couple of thoughts for you, sister:

1. When your manager gives your feedback, ask for examples of how you could be better. Focus on action, not feelings. Managers usually struggle with this because it’s so easy to give vague feedback like, “I feel like your team isn’t engaged.” Follow up with: Ok but what does that mean? What makes you feel that way? What behaviors would you like to see that you’re not seeing? It’s your manager’s job to help you succeed. If you are left wondering what behaviors/actions to improve on your team, than likely you’re not getting clear direction and that isn’t your fault. There’s nothing shameful or wrong about saying you don’t understand or don’t know. 

2. Always consider the source of feedback. Not every piece of feedback someone gives you is right. Feedback is opinion, so be sure you are asking yourself if the feedback makes sense to you. 

3. Write stuff down. Write your thoughts on paper. It will help you keep track of information and who said what, when. 

4. You’ve got this! I know how hard this can be, but you care and you are doing your best, and that’s more than enough! 

Good luck!🍀"
110,You say you've spoken to your team - but have you *listened* to them? What are they telling you? What do they need? How would they like to be engaged?
111,"The last piece I would add to this is make sure after you do all of these, email your boss the feedback and action items; then during your next 1-1 review them and start over again. It’s going to take consistent feedback and process improvement to move the needle. You’ve got this!"
112,"Thanks for the I just got written up today. Which is insane. One of the reasons being I am too black and white, I’m not engaging with me team and my boss feels I’m not in my department enough 🙄 good news I just got 3 interview requests for the next 2 weeks"
113,"I’m sorry to hear that, but glad to hear that you already have pother options! Sounds like the current place isn’t a great culture for anyway. Onwards and upwards!"

115,"Well, you ARE enough. It took me leaving a toxic job to realize just how bad it was and how much it had hurt my self worth m. Anything that drains you and makes you feel less than you are is not worth your time or attention. Period. 

You’re meant for better and brighter things, sister!

I’m sure a great employer will snatch you up in a heartbeat. 👍🏻"
116,"Hey there! I remember feeling like that when I first started working. A thing that I quickly realized over the years is that new things are supposed to be scary! You will make mistakes — that's how you learn. *Everyone* makes mistakes at work, and people are more forgiving than you might expect them to be (And if they're not — it's them, not you). Try and keep yourself open to that being okay.

Until you start, however some things to calm your anxiety:

* Try journaling! Letting all the fear out can help.
* Do something fun! You're about to start your career, which is exciting, but this might be the last few days or weeks that you get to really do whatever you want with limited responsibility. This might mean binging a show you've wanted to watch, hanging out with friends, or something else that brings up positive feelings for you.
* Meditating or Yoga

Good luck! The start of a new job is exciting, and I hope it goes great for you!"
117,"Remember that they hired you for a reason! They believe in you, and generally people want new employees to be happy and successful. Think of how happy your coworkers will be when they will be to have some extra help. 

If you have a person you connected to in the interview process, you could consider reaching out to them to ask them for a quick phone call or a coffee to answer questions and make them a buddy for your first weeks.  

We all suffer from imposter syndrome... not being good enough for our roles. But it’s definitely bullshit :) Take all the advice above and see if you can reframe your new workplace as a welcoming environment. One in which people are grateful to have you there and are eager to see you succeed. 

Good luck. You got this, career lady!"

127,"Ask what systems people use to keep organised - is there a tool or method that's fairly standard in the organisation?

If you have loads of tasks and you don't know which to start on first, ask your manager what tasks should take priority/who your key clients are. 

Get to know the colleagues you'll be working with - maybe see if anyone wants to go for lunch with you tomorrow at 1 pm? You can suggest somewhere simple like a sandwich shop that you can all sit in if that's where people usually grab lunch. If you don't know here people usually go, ask a colleague to show you where the good lunch spots are and then you've got at least one person to get to know. 

Embrace being the newbie and ask all the questions, even if they seem dumb. Later, you'll be so glad you asked rather than keep quiet! People forget to tell you things because they're the norm in that workplace and forget not everywhere uses the same processes, thinks the same way, has the same culture etc. Even prefix the question with, ""Maybe this seems a basic question, but I want to learn how it works here and do things right, so..."""

As far as the cramps go, it's been like this for years, normally the 1st/2nd day is like this and then i can't even tell i'm on my period for the rest of the week. I should probably see a doctor at some point, once i start my new job with better insurance."

147,"HR is there to support the company. The company has a vested interest in retaining employees at the lowest possible cost. 

There's some evidence that women don't negotiate offers, which certainly contributes. 

But a man and woman being paid separately isn't automatically a gender wage gap. There's a whole variety of factors to be considered such as experience, education, title, performance, what the market value of a position is, etc. 

It's not HR's job to tell you what your market value is or teach you how to negotiate. That's on you."
148,"The 69 cents on the dollar wage gap is a myth. 

If it was true, nobody would hire allegedly expensive men. Corporations hire big time expensive lawyers and HR bimbos to ensure the company is at no risk of a pay discrimination lawsuit. EEO watchdogs monitor hiring, promotion, and salary data. Women make choices to exit the workforce and be home in the evenings more than men do. They also choose less lucrative majors. 

Women have it pretty easy. When was the last time you saw a woman tarring a roof in 110F weather? Working a crab boat in 30F weather with ten foot seas? Installing carpet?  

I am a feminist according to the dictionary definition of ""feminist"". Equality. No special treatment. No special sports leagues. No fire department or police department (or other employment) quotas. No women only gyms. No girls only math classes. No women chess tournaments (ya, I couldn't believe that one either, but they do exist)."
149,"First off - how much of a difference are we talking?

> I recently learned that my male colleague (same title, same position)

That alone doesn't mean discrimination. Do you have any knowledge about his background? What other skills or industries he's worked in? What other previous experience he brought to the position? Is he much older than you? 

> I have noticed that this male colleague is working on one project whereas I am working on like 6!

That's a discussion for you and your manager on your work flow. Do you actually have capacity to work on six projects? If not, push back. 

> Not to mention that it appears to me that he is the CEO's favorite. Always receiving the praise of management.

That is not illegal. 

> I had a candid conversation with my director about this, and I basically asked for the reasons about this pay gap. 

Not the best way to approach this, honestly. Company policy almost certainly dictates that they cannot discuss another employees salary with you. Regardless of what the situation is when you find out someone similarly positioned to you has a higher salary, you don't go in and say pay me more because Bob gets paid $X. That's an incredibly weak negotiation position. Your salary should be based off market value and the skillset / experience you bring to the position. Knowing Bob's salary is useful information for you, but by no means should be the basis of how you ask for more money. It informs the amount you ask for, yes. Absent evidence in a discrimination lawsuit, that information shouldn't be explicitly stated when you ask your company for more money. There's a lot of good information on how to negotiate salary in situations like this on /r/personalfinance. It's also pretty out of touch to ask for a raise when you've only been somewhere six months, unless you're no longer doing the job you were hired to do or other extenuating circumstances. 

Did you negotiate your offer? 

> However, I know a male in the company (outside my organization) who received a 20% increase after only 4 months of being here.

Do you know all the details? What kind of leverage did this guy have? Do you have any leverage you can apply for pressure? I didn't see anything in your post that would make me think the company will change policies for you, unless/until you present them with a competing offer and if you're an important asset to them, or similar. 

> I want to send an email to HR, and my director highlighting these points and asking if there is gender discrimination

I would really not do that. You don't have enough information to make a claim of gender wage discrimination. Do you know the salaries of the other two women in your organization? Do you know the male salaries? Do you know everyone's background and skills? States take different defenses to the salary negotiation angle. How different is your current salary compared to the market value of your position? How much of a difference in pay are we talking about? 

You want to tread very carefully about making any hint of a legal allegation to your company. You could consult with an attorney, but you really need a lot more information that you've provided in your OP. 

You should also ensure that your work is above reproach from now on (not that I'm saying it currently isn't). But be aware that asking the questions you're asking could cause the company to look for any reason to terminate your employment. 

I would personally determine what your market value is, and if they aren't willing to bring you up to that salary by your 1 year review, consider alternative employment.

Note: none of this is fair, but it is how you have to play the game. It's exceedingly difficult to prove these sorts of things (both pay discrimination and retaliatory firing) so be careful about what you question and to whom you question it."
150,Before I answer this at length - Do you and your male colleague have comparable previous experience?
151,"Personally, I would say if you’re not happy now, that likely won’t change if you don’t make a change.  

You’re in a position to be able to start a new career.  Why not go for it?  I bet being a pilot would be very rewarding!  I travel for work, and there’s nothing quite like it.  I think more and more people are choosing life satisfaction over “the hustle” we all think we’re supposed to be part of.  I know I have.  I also think it’s a decision that comes with age, experience, and a re-evaluation of prioritizes.  Prioritize you.  Good luck!"
152,"I don't thing it's ever too late to change. If something in your current life is truly making you so unhappy, then make whatever change you need to. 

I'm not a professional advice giver, nor should you ever feel obligated to do what a stranger says (unless your life is in direct danger). But I will say this, you have worked very, very, very hard to get where you are now. That much is obvious. You've invested a lot of time, energy, and money into pursuing your dream. Think carefully about what you want to do. If you really want to learn how to pilot a plane, take a couple of lessons in your free time to see if you really like it. Take an extended vacation or temporary leave of absence while you sort out your thoughts and what you want to do. I get the feeling that you're starting to feel overwhelmed with your life/career at the moment. It's entirely possible that perhaps all you need is a break to breathe.

Basically, you've rushed to get ahead your whole life and that's okay. But remember that you do have the luxury of taking some time to relax. You're young and highly accomplished, so find a way incorporate more fun stuff in your life (hobbies are fantastic). You've got more than enough time. After giving it some (serious) thought, if you decide you still want to change careers, then go for it. Your happiness is all that should ever matter."
153,"You deserve to live your life exactly how you want to and being successful already will make that even more possible! You just need to take the risk and go for it. I’m 26, and every year I feel less like the person who I was college. I don’t know how anyone is supposed to know what they want to do for the rest of their life at 18. I’m still figuring out my career and once I decide I might change my mind again. Who knows. Also - a pilot is absolutely a woman’s job :)"
154,"It is never too late to change and take a new direction in life! Whether it is a matter of finding a new career path, taking some time off to pursue other interests, or seriously enforcing boundaries between your professional and personal lives, what matters most is creating a life that you love and that you are proud of (not due to outside expectations, but by what resonates within you). 

I am 33 and still figuring out my career path (I have worked in international travel, non profit administration, and a variety of other fields). There's no shame in changing direction, and as long as you are breathing you can always make changes to support your dreams and personal well being.

159,"“Go start your own lunch”

I’m in construction, I’m one of two women PMs on a 600+ person job site. My company is 8% women and nearly all of them are in administrative roles like accounting, HR, reception, etc. Nobody has time for male pedants that want to make a positive experience for a minority about themselves. There’s no need to be polite about it."
160,"They’re just complaining because they can. Let them come to one. When they see it’s not in fact a naked campfire romp, but a bunch of serious ladies discussing thing they have no interest in, they’ll quickly lose interest. If for some reason they do take an interest in the issues plaguing women in your company, that just means more allies! If you suspect it’s being done to undermine women in the org, Take it up with HR. A boy’s club switcheroo won’t make this go away."
161,"Yes! ""go start your own lunch"" is such a great short and sweet way to reply to this. Men who complain about these kinds of things are simply being obstinate and already know why it's important. I wouldn't give them any more energy than that."

164,"Is that six weeks of time as sick time only? Or six weeks of 'baby bonding' on top of your sick time to recover from child birth? Would you be allowed to use the California Paid Family Leave time of 6 weeks at ~60% pay? If you get all of that, then you're up to maybe 4.5 months before going unpaid (3 months if they count CPFL as unpaid)."
165,"I suggest to ask for the 4 months off unpaid.  I think if you ask to start in about 8 months from now (after completing pregnancy and 4 months of leave), it would be a no-go.  They don't have a lot to lose by bringing you in asap.  I have been involved in hiring people and in general I think we wouldn't mind waiting for the right candidate, but 4 months is still actually a long time.   I think if you could reduce your time out to closer to 3 months, it would probably work out better, but if that doesn't work for you then don't second guess yourself.  It's your life, your time, your baby.  I was off 12 weeks (US, FMLA) and I was thrilled to go back to work. Can I ask why you think you would do part time work instead of going right back in?  Are you planning to use childcare only part time for that period or will be training a nanny or observing the daycare?"
166,"My thoughts are if you're ok financially to have your start date after the baby is born, it doesn't hurt to ask for more time off as a condition to accept the earlier start date. I definitely wasn't ready to come back to work at 6 weeks post partum."
167,"All great questions. I believe it's 6 weeks of state disability capped off by the employer to reach full pay, so 6 weeks of paid time off and then you're expected to return to work. That last bit is mandatory for San Francisco, where the job is. It's hard to say, I just got the offer letter outlining benefits and it said ""6 weeks maternity leave"" and that's it. When I asked if there was the option for additional unpaid time off after that, they said I would need to talk with the department manager as each department needs were different. This has all been in general terms so far -- the topic of my own pregnancy hasn't been brought up by the employer, although I did disclose it in one of my final interviews. (I can't imagine that everyone I've spoken with there isn't privy at this point though.)"
168,"Thanks for your response! It’s hard to know if 12 weeks would work or not for me/us as I’ve not had a baby before and don’t know how the bonding time will feel and/or if I will be anxious to get back to work. Maybe I will be itching to get into an office but my gut tells me I will have a hard time leaving him. But, I don’t want to give up my career and this is also a great opportunity.

Re: starting out part time rather than FT, seems easier to leave baby for a half day at a time than a whole day. Most likely we would be shifting my husband’s schedule so he will take care of baby during the day rather than getting a nanny. His work schedule is flexible."
169,"I don't think you could get a full time job offer with leave and part time hours for so many months.  You can try, but it doesn't seem reasonable.  Be very flexible about your terms, and maybe they'll be flexible, too.

I do think you'll need more help with caring for the baby than you think.  My husband and I worked the same full time schedule with baby in daycare and we hired someone to clean the house every couple of weeks. It was still a lot to juggle regular housework, laundry cooking, groceries.  The clock doesn't stop when work does!  During the weekday crunch, we only had about 2 hours with baby in the evening but it was a treasure."
170,"I made a choice like this, but for even more of a pay cut. I chose the lower-paying but more fun and close job over the one that paid more but was at a place I wasn’t at all passionate about and that would have taken up 2.5 hours of commuting a day. 

I ended up getting a promotion really soon and extra benefits like work from home with the lower-paying job and am so happy I made the decision I did. That definitely helped even it out, but even without those perks I was happier being able to walk to work at a fun company with coworkers I like. Money isn’t everything in a job."

172,"What % pay cut is it? $5,000 may be a lot for some jobs, but for other jobs it may not be when considered as a % of total pay.

Is $5,000 the before or after tax amount? Look at the after tax (take home) difference. Also consider the cost savings on the commute - how much more would you spend on gas per year, and how much less wear and tear would there be on your car (future maintenance costs)? I did the calculation a while back to save about 20 minutes on my commute... The pay cut ended up being worth it from both financial and mental health perspectives.

Also look at future opportunities - if there's room to grow at the new company, you make soon outpace your current pay.

You mentioned that you  negotiated on pay - perhaps if they can't come up in pay, they could look at more vacation time?

What would you do with an extra hour and a half each day? Would this allow you to go to the gym? Do yoga? Cook dinner? Read?"
173,"Thanks for your thoughts! That's the direction I'm leaning because it's not too much of a pay cut, but that extra $5K just seems like a lot when you've gotten used to having it."
174,The $5000 difference is AFTER I negotiated... they can only go up so much because of internal equity.
175,"Yeah I can definitely understand that, and of course not everyone has the freedom to turn down extra money. For me it was my first job so any amount of money seemed like a lot. Maybe you could try to negotiate for more money or vacation to even it out?"

182,"It seems slightly mad to me that you're asking 'whether' you were 'ever' subject to toxic masculinity rather than 'when' you were 'last' subject to it. Anyway, to answer your questions (and this applies to all workplaces I have had where there were staff of different genders):

1. Yes. 

2. Yes.

3. Yes, daily.

4. No, because it's a risky course of action that is also unlikely to help them.

5. Yes, I discuss it online because I'm a sucker for punishment (and in my better moments, believe that educating people about equality is going to change things - every droplet is part of the ocean, and changing the mind of one person is to change the world).

No, I don't find online discussions help to bring resolution, as gender inequality is a systemic issue and not one that individual women can resolve. Educating the people who make decisions and hold power in a business can result in organisational culture change, but many people who experience toxic masculinity are not in a position to influence leaders/managers.

Online discussions tend to either be talking in an echo chamber of other women who experience the same things and are already well aware of privilege, bias, etc, or devolve into being attacked by trolls who are determined, regardless of the different kinds of proof you put in front of them, to see the world as a place where everyone has equity already. Especially women.

Overall, my workplace is a very modern place and it tries to hire young people, as people our generation tend to be more open to gender equality and equal opportunities. However, some of the employees deviate far from the company’s values.

185,"I think it depends on your region, industry, and if you have to work with clients/public, so I wouldn't say that needing to secure your belongings is definitely an indication of a bad place to work.  That said, if it was a bad place to work, then facilities should have established locking cabinets.  In the absence of locking cabinets, the employees should request locking cabinets.  If it's really an unsecured workspace and if no secure cabinets are provided, then it probably is worth leaving.  Wear a backpack in the meanwhile (ONLY if you don't have to worry about pickpockets, machinery, or doing gymnastics).  You can use a lightweight backpack that folds down to a pouch and pop it in your purse while commuting, then switch to wearing the backpack while working."

190,"There is a solution to this! However, it takes practice and willingness to navigate confrontation. You need to learn how to set boundaries with people. Your colleagues need to know that the way they are speaking to you will not be tolerated and that if they are wanting help or looking to find solutions to their problems, that speaking to you in that manner is not the way to do it. First recognize that their frustration has absolutely nothing to do with you. You already know this but reminding yourself before you respond helps place the issue outside of yourself so that you don't feel like you're being attacked if they react poorly. They're projecting their frustration of having to assimilate to new ways of doing things and feeling like they can't keep up makes them lash out at those who can. Considering you're younger and a women, its being projected even harder. Before you go to your superiors about this, try fixing it yourself by setting boundaries.

Second, I know they're rude and obnoxious but calling them ""a bunch of crybabies who can't handle change"", however true that may be, really dismisses the root cause of their frustration. Change IS hard especially in a time when older people aren't able to keep up with the rapid pace that technology is evolving. They're older, technology is new to them, things are different than what they're used to, they feel like they can't keep up, they're having to seek someone younger than them for help, some people operate and learn differently. We could very well be in their shoes one day! Try and recognize that there is more to it than just them being obstinate . Having compassion towards people makes dealing with them a whole lot easier. That being said, not EVERYONE deserves compassion. At the end of the day, people just want to be heard and are often unequipped with how to communicate properly and professionally. That's where you need to step in require that they do better. 

 Boundaries look like:

* ""I understand you're frustrated but I don't appreciate you speaking to me this way""
* ""I just want to remind you that I'm here to help, not be a punching bag for your frustrations"" 
* ""We can work together to help mitigate your frustrations but I don't appreciate you speaking to me like this ""
* ""I can hear that youre upset but I'm going to have to ask that you call me back when you're ready to speak to me in a more professional/respectful manner""

Use your judgement but at some point in your career, you're going to have to learn how to deal with people like this head on because otherwise you'll just fall into a place of victimhood. 

&#x200B;

This all seems simple but it can be really difficult to do starting out  You can't predict someones behavior or reaction to setting boundaries and thats the main reason why we as women have a hard time doing so until we are pushed to the limit. Start now because it only gets easier and becomes second nature once you start doing it. Remember also, kill them with fucking kindness. They want you to feel what they're feeling but you don't have to. You being overly kind and gracious will make them feel like dummies for acting so irrational. You don't HAVE to do that but you also don't have to put up with that behavior. You gotta let these people know that you're not going to have it and that they need to treat you with the same respect you treat them! 

&#x200B;

You got this!"
191,"I, too, work in a corporate office and while a majority of people I work with are very professional, every once in a while, I have had people be very...passionate...about which way to do something or the other. 

That's usually how I respond, something to the effect of, ""I hear your passion for getting it right and we are on the same side. I'm happy to help. Please continue to remain thoughtful and respectful in our conversations, even when frustrated, as we are all working toward the same goal.""

It helps set the boundary and call them out gently yet firmly, and give them a chance to adjust. Hopefully that will do it."
192,"Thank you SO MUCH for that. I would never say the crybaby thing to them, but yeah I felt it. UGH :( I totally get the older generation needing some help catching up and I'm here for it. I helped one gentleman add a contact to his iPhone over the phone. It was ridiculous lol but I did it with a smile because he was willing to learn. I definitely needed that point of view you provided, though. I never really thought of it like that. Even still, a certain level of respect and professionalism is expected. I am going to try some of those statements! I'm in this transition of moving up and taking on more responsibility and I don't want to be the meek door mat. I also don't want to be the raging tyrant. Balance and boundaries!"
193,Yeah girl! You got this. Middle management is really when you start to suss out what kind of leader and professional you want to become. It's exciting while also traumatizing at the same time haha.  I'm right here with you! You're on the right track :)
194,"Being nice is not the rent you pay to be in the world. 

If distancing yourself from him is costing you career-wise, maybe it's time to re-evaluate and see if he's able to behave appropriately. Otherwise, you've got boundaries and your workplace has boundaries and you have every right to expect that people respect them."
195,"I totally get it. I had a coworker who I considered to be a good friend drunkenly make similar remarks and I never felt the same comfort with him afterwards and we have been really distant. But I figure that this is my gut reaction and it is there to keep me safe. Not only physically but emotionally - it felt super shitty to know he only saw me that way, and who knows how that would manifest in the future. I think it’s a fair reaction- actions have consequences."
196,"That's more than ""somewhat"" inappropriate, and I would avoid him too if I were you. It sounds like he knows what he did was wrong, but if he does anything like that again I hope you feel comfortable enough to call out that inappropriate behavior in the moment. Otherwise, take it to HR."
197,"Thanks for sharing, I'm sorry to hear you experienced a similar situation. I always thought it was great to be able to joke around with a colleague and have someone to confide in, but his actions during the trip have really destroyed the platonic base we had. At the end of the day it's important to keep the workplace separate. I still try to be professional and friendly, but avoid more than the minimum amount of work interactions."

208,The premise is to get women to stay in their careers and make it you senior level positions in order to lower the prevalence of sexism in the workplace. To do this women need to avoid being trampled by systems that have been built into the business world. The book also questions the traits society considers to be 'masculine' and if these are really masculine traits or if you've just been taught to not have those traits from an early age as a woman because of patriarchy (e.g. when girls are taught to not be outspoken or confident).

210,"I would respond with something like ""So sorry, I actually have x, y, and z on my plate this week so I won't be able to help."" 

Depending on the situation you could say or add something like ""Team Coordinator, would you let me know which of my (xyz) tasks I should put off in order to do A/B/C for Lazybones Teammate? (maybe in a separate email to Team Coordinator). 

The point is, you already have a full workload. Instead of ignoring the emails, you need to make it clear that your plate is full. Listing all the tasks you're working on and asking the coordinator to help you ""prioritize"" basically takes the heat off of you for either A) not helping, or B) not getting your own work done."
211,"Oh yeah, and if Team Coordinator is voluntelling you to stay late even though he KNOWS you are overloaded, you come up with some excuse. You're leading Bible study at church tonight, your aunt is having surgery and you're babysitting her kids, your dog is sick, whatever it is, it has to be something that they can't reasonably tell you NOT to go do that thing instead of staying late at work for something that is not your problem. 

  
Team Coordinator (seems like the manager) is not managing efficiently, and if he is forced to do all the extra work, the fact that his life sucks is going to make him want to figure out alternate solutions. Such as... making Lazy Teammate do his/her work."
212,"No, the team coordinators have no management/supervisory role. They are literally just one person on each ""team"" for the interim director to spend more time with and share more information with. Only the interim director can assign work/manage/etc (no it does not make any sense). The team coordinator is trying to assign work, and when I push back he responds by making it look like I'm not contributing."
213,"And I said I had xyz so could not help the con artist, and the team coordinator responded that he also has xyz but he is willing to stay late and help etc. My problem is that he is making me look bad when I just refuse to be a doormat."

I agree, it's like the mental labor thing in relationships, and now its in work as well."
217,"My goodness this is too close to home. I made a lateral move after a few years and finally received a promotion and a raise after several more years. Increased scope of role along the whole way. 

So that's turned out to be just enough to cover inflation over that same time period plus a 5% raise. My own observations of many people's careers is that the path to at least approaching fair compensation for this type of treatment and double standard for getting ahead, is to switch companies every few years. It's scary, but it's the kind of disruptive step needed to push reset, have a chance at renegotiating the boundaties and command the pay increase. 

As for avoiding this pattern in the future, I'm all ears. I think it's going to take more confidence and assertiveness and a firm willingness to say no and take risks to make things better. All things I'm striving towards."
218,"This is so true! I've been in my current role for an year. I was one of the first 2 hired to replace a 70- member team so you can imagine the chaos. I set up the processes, quickly learned about the different teams and technologies, troubleshot issues and documented everything for new hires. Thanks to my efforts, we no longer have crazy releases. 

But ... In the last appraisal, my manager discounted all that and gave me a raise of 2%. He has hired another person, 3 years younger to me, for a title that I was promised after a year of experience.

I make sure I always highlight the work I do. I communicate my expectations about growth in monthly meetings with the manager. I'm at a loss what else can be done.

I've found another job, which is actually my dream job, that pays 3x more. I'm currently in my notice period. But urgh, I don't know how to make sure this doesn't repeat."
219,"I can’t wait to read the rest of the comments on this. Reading what you wrote was as if I’d written it myself! I was slave zoned in the most epic way at my last company. When we finally reached appraisal time, I was handed my pay increase letter and it was a difference of......£50. After tax. I looked at my manager and asked if this was a joke. He said (direct quote) “some people got nothing, so you should be grateful”.  Meanwhile I discovered that this man was earning almost 4 times my salary. I handed in my notice about a month later."
220,"Yup! The key is leverage. Lay out everything you’ve achieved, all the ways you’ve gone above and beyond. Get happy clients to email you with a “review”, raise your profile within the company by being shit-hot at what you do so that when you get to appraisal time you can show them all that and then you say this is why I think I deserve a raise. 
Even better is if you start doing the work of a job above you without being asked, then find a job description and salary of that job from a job ad from some other company, then show it to them and say “I’ve being doing all these things already but I’m not being paid the going rate - cough up”. 
I did that once and it worked because they had no counter argument. For them to refuse me a raise at that point would be an open admission that I was being purposefully underpaid."
221,I've heard that gratitude BS before and every time it reminds me how they would absolutely pay me less if they could.
222,"Usually the response one gets to this at the places I'v worked is, ""Well, \*I\* think you deserve a raise, but it's out of my control, because (blah blah upper management has a wage freeze blah blah our budget is being cut blah blah I'll put in a good word for you blah blah things are tough all over.)  

I think the problem is that you don't really have an opportunity to do such ""proactive"" things because you're too busy managing the ""emergency"" work that's been put on your plate.

I suspect most women who are getting slave-zoned are working for dysfunctional departments or companies to begin with... where promises are not kept because management is by crisis and it's just expedient to load work onto the ""reliable, smart girl.""  There's often turnover in management and new people come in and no one remembers you or what you have done, just that you're ""the smart girl who knows how to do the thing.""  

The usual admonition to friend-zoned guys is ""Know what you want and stop hanging around that girl who isn't interested in you... have a social life outside of your relationship to this girl... pursue hobbies and personal interests that expand your social world until you meet the right one... etc""  I think this advice can be translated to slave-zoned women, unfortunately what that effectively means is that you have to leave your current company once you sense you've been slave-zoned, because they are NEVER going to look at you differently after you have spent years in the Slave Zone.  Have a social life outside of this job... pursue interests and gain skills that expand your network... yeah, a lot of us don't want to hear this because we are invested in the time and effort we have given our current company.

Sadly I also think there's an analogy to this when you consider what they call ""incels"" -- the friendzoned guys who have never gotten any attention and are extremely bitter and toxic about the fact.  I have seen women who not only have been Slave Zoned in the workplace, but who have grown absolutely toxic over it, passive aggressive, bitter, all they do is complain, mutter and yet they STILL bend over backwards trying to do everything and still expecting to get respect that they will never receive.  The sad thing is that these women often have very high standards and work ethic, but are throwing it away down a black hole, which is also now sucking them down.  :-(

So I would guess, first thing you need to do, is take a hard look at yourself and ask yourself, is your strong work ethic being misapplied to the wrong situation and the wrong people?  Would it kill you to be a little less ""reliable and smart"" on this job and apply more of your work ethic to stuff outside of work (taking a class, hobbies that could become a business, applying for other work?)"
223,Exactly! Took me ages to understand that they work you as hard as they can get away with and pay you as little as they can get away with.

231,"Yeah, I get that. It’s pretty hard to get the right tone when standing up for yourself in most situations. You really have to practice it so it comes it in such away that it is very natural and will continue to bring value to the conversation. 

Generally if you have an ally in the meeting/conference, it comes across a bit better when they stand up for you, especially if they are a man. Having people who stick up for you makes all the difference."

Figured out your market value and ask for that. If they say no, look for a new job."
235,"I find something to learn about.  Normally, it relates to my work or industry.  There are so much information on the internet, it is so easy to start learning about a simple topic that's in the news and get lost in it."
236,I find throwing myself into a task helps the time go by. I set a timer and tell myself I can go back to doing something else once the timer goes off but until then I have to dive in. I set it for about 20 min. Most of the time I get wrapped up in the task and keep going after the timer goes off. And then before you know it the day is done. It really depends on what you’re working on though.
237,"That's amazing, congratulations! Keep up the hard work and treat yourself to something great. :)"
238,Congratulations!! !!!!
239,You go girl
240,Thank you so much!! 😭✊
241,"It's probably because you are drinking too much coffee. I try to have tea with my lunch and it tends to help, and then when you start to feel like you're crashing eat some fruit. I always eat like a peach or something and just the act of eating wakes me up. I used to eat stuff from the vending machine or really sugary stuff, but that makes the crash even worst."
242,"Drink more water throughout the day! If you need a quick pick me up, rapidly drink 4-6oz of real cold water. It will Schick the system similar to caffeine"
243,"A brisk walk, even around the office but preferably outside in the fresh air, followed by a glass of cold water. You can make it work time by scheduling walking meetings, e.g. catching up with colleagues on projects or checking in with subordinates or your boss."
244,"I have low blood pressure and often have this draining feeling. I steer away from food & drugs.

1-Food takes energy to breakdown for absorption 2-Drugs can have unknown risks decades later

My resolutions are exercise. Anything that elevates my heart rate & mobilizes my blood pressure.  I bring tshoes for a brisk walk or find a fire escape & walk up/down the stairs. As long as it can be done in suits & heels for me. 

Perhaps it may also be the way you are sitting. Try straight & forward as if attentively interested.  It is normal for your mind to sense the end of day & trigger your body into bordom positions that lead to energy crashes. I have a watch/heart monitor and my perfect ""at attention"" heart rate is between 100-120 bpm. Monitor your heart thru the day and see what positions best trigger a higher rate for you. Every one is different. 

I was a certified fitness instructor in high school before moving onto college. I saw this & more frequently among all kinds of people.  So forgive yourself this daily dip. The 2-4p energy wain is the same for those of us who work graveyard at 2-3a. Our bodies are way smarter than us. It knows when our day is soon to wind down & begins preparing us in advance by feeling drained. Perhaps some nuts & veggies will help you. If not, try something that elevates your bpm.

All the best success!"
245,"Walking definitely helps, I take berries to work a lot, I mix it with a Dannon yogurt for a mini yogurt parfait in the middle of the afternoon, my favorite snack bc its light, low in calories and sweet :)"
246,"You can’t.  This is fairly common in Male-dominated companies where the culture of the company gives the perception there can only be one successful woman/minority.  If there’s a generation gap, same for women who come from a n earlier generation.  (In some of these make-dominated firms, it becomes a weakness for the few women/minorities if they band together, so they often don’t in order to succeed). And your boss is deliberately reinforcing this. 


If you want a collaborative environment, you may need to seek a different organization.  OR create it with the men."
247,"That’s very frustrating. Are you two colleagues or is she your superior? I feel like I would ask her if she wants to go to happy hour one day and get to know her personally. Establish trust and try and relate to her, and then once you do that you can start expressing some frustration with the culture and see if she’s willing to work with you on overcoming it. And then at work - stand up for her if there’s an opportunity. Show her how you can help each other. I think a lot of times women think we have to work within the competitive catty framework men expect of us to be successful, but in reality we are so much more powerful when we look out for each other. I’ve had success with this in my job. Hope this helps!!!"
248,"I'm in this exact situation. I'm trying to model the behavior I want to see, so I'm constantly looking for ways to be genuinely encouraging and uplifting. ""I loved the way you handled that situation!"" ""Has anyone ever told you that you are really good at xyz?"" Etc. When I talk about her to our colleagues, I try to say something positive like ""She nailed her interview. I wish I could interview that well!"" Not sure if it's working yet, but until I find some other strategies I'm doing this!"
249,"Yeah, someone once asked me in an interview “have you ever been thrown under the bus?”  I didn’t get the job but I didn’t want it either"
250,Omg weird. I think she was new and it was almost like she was just telling me how this place is really not working out and is so bad.
251,In what way? If I want to feel powerful at work I wear black (like if I have a big negotiation or presentation). But I wouldn’t say the colour black on its own empowers me. In Canada. Also not a ceo or anything. Just mid level. Cheers :)
252,"I love to wear a pop of cobalt blue. I find that in business (at least the ones I've worked in) everyone sticks to monochromatic tones, so when I wear cobalt blue I stand out...there is no missing me.

Edit: country is Canada."
253,I like vivid bright orange like bursting out the page from America :D makes ya feel good! But wearing would be black for sure
254,"I feel my best in olive green. For my work environment, it’s enough color without going too off the wall. I feel like I look great in the color which translates into me feeling confident. I’m representing the United States :)"
255,"I like red. It's not a common choice but it makes me feel in control since it will command attention. If a red dress with black jacket doesn't feel appropriate, I use red nail paint and/or lipstick.

I'm from India."
256,"My most empowering color is red. It’s such a vibrant and aggressive color that many people shy away from it. It’s easily become my backbone for most color choices I make. From dying my hair (though right now, I’m rocking purple), to choosing what color my work keyboard glows, to what color I want in my bedroom. It makes me feel sexy and powerful and honestly, it’s the best feeling in the world!

I’m in the USA."
257,"I always go red, black, and white. Bold, memorable and still conservative.

Representing the United Kingdom"
258,"Thanks so much for your response—really appreciated.  
It really was your go-to colour in the general sense but you are right, in the work setting, our wardrobes usually are where we play up our moods and how we sometimes dig to give ourselves that ""additional boost"".  
Mid-Level or CEO, we are all a part of the engine in our respective businesses that help ""the wheels turn"" :)  


Cheers."
259,Awesome. Thanks so much for your feedback. It's really appreciated!
260,SWEET! Thanks so much :)
261,That's absolutely the feeling your colour should evoke—thanks so much! :)
262,I love that your colour finds it's way into and outside of your wardrobe—a true sign of feeling empowered in it. Thanks so much!
