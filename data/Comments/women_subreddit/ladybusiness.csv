4,"Hey y'all! My business is Metacog Misfits and we're running an evidence-based social campaign called How to be a Good Human. I think this is the first time I've posted about this on Reddit. I struggle with mental health and the last few weeks I've let the business fall to the wayside but today, I'm feeling better and I'm working on articles and a podcast to release. I won't let my mental health problems ruin a good thing!"
5,"Hi ladies! I am working with my business partner to relaunch our shoe brand, Thesis Couture. We have re-engineered the woman's high heel and have created a stilletto that is comfortable and looks good (you can wear for over twelve hours easily). Internal structure was created by an ex-SpaceX exec, an astronaut, an orthopedist, and a fashion scientist. 

Our production team is in Italy and we are in California so we have halted our pre-release date to let people focus on their health and family. In the meantime, we are excited to continue growing our mailing list while we sit here in quarantine. :)"
6,"What a beautiful mission. Sending you the most encouraging vibes to continue spreading this and helping others (and yourself). God knows we all need it, especially now!"
7,"I love this. Best of luck to you! Also, I'll definitely be looking into your products because heels are absurdly uncomfortable most of the time."
8,Thank you so much. This was such a kind response and I can't begin to explain how much I appreciate it!

It's important that a business looks as great as it is, and the size of a business doesn't detract from that.

20,"This is genius! I love this idea and really hope it takes off! I'm not an expert but initially it sounds like this would work great for the majority of patients but probably not great for trauma victims, at least not in more public  spaces like coffee shops. Honestly that's really my only constructive criticism. Walking seems to make a lot of sense. I don't have the sources to back this up but as a previous foster parent I can tell you the most my kiddos ever shared was in the car driving. There is something about not making eye contact that makes it easier and probably makes the person sharing less self conscious. I wish you all the best!!!"
21,"#Attention businesswomen

Do you run or manage a thriving ecommerce store? (making at least $10k revenue every month)

If yes, see if at least one of the option applies to you -

~ You are happy in getting a good conversion from Facebook ads.

~ You don't have time to write regular emails.

~ You have the time but you aren't getting the open rates you deserve.

~ You email your subscribers once in a while and that too, with a sales pitch.

~ Your regular emails are sorted but that's not the case with automated sequences.


If you said yes to any one of them, I wanna talk to you in some depth (if time permits for both of us).

**What I offer**:  Handling & scaling of your email marketing channel (+ free audit of your current email marketing strategy).

Bad: Monday morning meetings always make me nervous. I’m always scared of being called out!

30,"Yeah, I’d have to make an appointment with my family doctor (2.5 hours from home), ask for a referral, wait a month or longer to hear from that gyno with an appointment date sometime within the next 6-12 months. it’s not urgent and I had a pap less than 3 years ago, so bottom of the list I go. 

Not to mention the time off work for it."

33," I recently launched [https://ethosq.com](https://ethosq.com/), a culture-fit matchmaking platform for tech recruitment. 

Through my own experience with job hunting, I have found there is no effective way to review unbiased insights into the company culture and employee experiences. EthosQ aims to bridge this gap enabling job seekers to make more informed decisions on applying or accepting a position with an employer.

EthosQ matches talent with employers in three easy steps:

1. Job seekers will select their preferred employee experiences, such as flexible working schedules or ability to work from home, and then take our 5-minute assessment to receive a customized ranking of their workplace cultural values
2. Our platform collects feedback from validated current employees. Employees provide insights into the current culture, experiences, and whether or not they recommend the employer.
3. Our matching engine churns the numbers to calculate the unique EthosQ (EQ) match score per employer. The EQ match score determines the person-company compatibility. We are ultimately helping candidates make more informed decisions about applying or accepting a position.

For employers, we provide the ability to:

1. Claim your profile to take the first step in becoming an engaged employer.
2. Attract new talent by customizing your EthosQ Employer profile with your benefits and differentiators.
3. Identify areas of improvement through detailed anonymous employee feedback.
4. Boost your organization’s commitment to creating a happier and healthier workplace.

This is our first version release so I would be happy to hear some feedback on concept and execution."

40,"Addiction + Passion = Success

[Because honestly we never really subtract addiction (or bad habits) from our lives. But when we focus more on our passion and the things that drive us I can realistically see the need/want to feed those bad habits decreases. ]

--------------------------------------------

Think continued maintenance. 
I also want to work with other people who just haven't had the best opportunities in life. 

I really believe that connection is the key to life. 

Disconnect from life, society, the things you enjoy and you will quickly find yourself isolated, depressed, and unhappy. 

See for me isolation was my gateway drug. It started when I was younger I felt unnaccepted and for my own reasons disconnected myself from the joy of life and in that time was unfortunately suffering from trauma. But that's always the same story. 

I want to open a school that teaches life skills like communication, money management, and how to deal In certain situations where we once blew up, stuffed or ran away.

47,"Hello everyone! I'm looking for some help!

I’m a brand designer who specializes in food products but I’m looking to validate a new idea in this niche.

I'm not looking to take advantage and just ask tons of questions without giving anything in exchange.

I see a lot of amazing people create valuable content and courses only to fail because they can't reach their audience.

It's not about posting on Instagram, having a huge mailing list, or even using the latest camera to add more value to your course.

I'm talking of having a brand that connects with people in order to bring sales.

And I want to help you with that. For free.

No strings attached, no pitch or upsale, no mailing list.

I’ll be completely clear though: I want to talk to you because I’m doing research.

I’m not new at creating brands that sell. You will benefit from the combined knowledge and experience of the past 10 years I’ve worked as a professional designer.

What you’ll get: a branding strategy call. Not some lame “free 10 minutes” where I pitch my services, but a complete 1 hour session where we’ll discuss your project inside out and diagnose what’s going on with your brand and business. You will also get the video recording, so you can see it as many times as you’d like and take action.

This is one of my current services, valued at $257. And you will get it free of cost in exchange of…

What I want: honesty. I’ll make uncomfortable questions to help you out, and I need you to be real if you want to get value out of the session.

That’s it.

To recap: if you are a course creator who is already making sales, but you are struggling with connecting to your audience or are unhappy with your brand, I want to help you (in exchange for your help).

Are you interested? Let me know in the comments or send me DM and I'll send you a form to see if we a re good fit.

Thanks!"
48,"I always feel odd touting my business and myself.  First, let me introduce myself.  My my name is Christina Garvin and I'm a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine.  I graduated from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, where, under two merit scholarships, I obtained a degree in Biology.  I then attended the California School of Podiatric Medicine under scholarship where I received my Doctorate of Podiatric Medicine.  I then completed a 3-year surgical residency at the New Mexico VA Hospital in Albuquerque, NM where I gained experience with limb salvage and complex reconstructive foot and ankle surgery.  My proudest moment of residency was when I was awarded the Academic Resident’s Award for obtaining the highest score on the American Board of Podiatric Surgery’s In-Training Exam. 

In 2015, I decided to open my own practice, Littleton Foot and Ankle Clinic,  in Littleton, CO.  I work very hard to treat every single one of my patients as if they were my own family.  I don't believe in making you sit in a waiting room, I don't believe in making you wait months to see me, I want to ensure we find a treatment plan that works for both the patient and me.  Over all, this is a partnership.  

Littleton  Foot and Ankle Clinic is also a technology focused practice.  My wonderful husband who is not only my IT guy, but an amazing technology guy, claims I only pay him in chicken wings and beer, but I think that's how he likes it.  We are a paperless office because of him and he has created an amazing website for us at [https://www.littletonfootandankleclinic.com/](https://www.littletonfootandankleclinic.com/)

We accept most insurance and cash pay.  

If you are anywhere in the Denver Metro, or really anywhere in Colorado and want to make the drive, and need a podiatrist, Littleton Foot and Ankle Clinic can get you back on your feet."

Sleep problems are notoriously difficult to fix. Even the best professional psychologist with the most up to date CBT techniques working with you for months will have a majority relapse rate (c.80%). So I think the questions a waste of time sorry."
67,"#4 is the most direct and makes the most sense. I do also think you need more of a hook at the beginning though. Something like, “sleep easy knowing that I am here to help you.”

Edit: I’m on mobile and don’t know why the text is huge lol"
68,"4, with a couple caveats: 

a) Most of your clients won't be entrepreneurs. You're an entrepreneur, but they're just someone who wants a better night sleep. Don't shrink your client base by saying your product or service is only for entrepreneurs. 

b) People don't need to know how sleep benefits them, unless you're telling them something they don't already know 

With those in mind, something like this: 
*I help busy people get better sleep within 6 weeks.*

Or:
*I show busy people how to get better sleep within 6 weeks.* 

The second one for if you're teaching them a skill, and the first one if not."
69,"PS, the phrase you are looking for is ""*things* on their minds"" not ""*thinks* on their minds."""
70,It’s because you used a # at the start of your sentence FYI.
71,The hashtag makes the text large and emphasized
72,"I took a look at your site. Your products are very cute! As far as customer experience, I really like the simplicity of the design. Your collections and pages are very straight-forward. I did have a question about the products. I see you're using Shopify. Did you know you can add a file upload option to the product as a line-item property? This would eliminate the need to email customers for their images. I was also wondering why you have a Ships From option on some of your products. I do think some of your other products should be showcased on your front page. At first glance it appears that you only sell clothes and blankets.

I hope my feedback was helpful! :)"

It seems so silly. So why do it for women? 

Honestly, I don't agree with pointing out that a woman is also a boss. I know we aren't in a place culturally, yet, where the instinctual thought of someone in charge is gender-less, but pointing out ""hey everyone, that woman is a boss! She's a lady boss"" does more harm than good. The only thing a Female boss can't do that a male one can is pee standing up, and now they have Shee-Wees, so we can even do that, lol. 

I just think in a time where we really are making so much progress in all lines of work and breaking through that glass ceiling, why try to further make divides between women and men. I'm a boss, I'm in charge, my gender has no impact on my performance or quality of work I produce. "
99,"I'm almost 40 years old; I'm not a ""girl"" anymore. Female boss is fine."
100,"I wouldn't like Girl Boss at all. I would accept female boss, but I'm not sure why it would be necessary. From my name and from the pronouns used in the interview, it should be clear I'm female. And boss is a lousy term to use in an printed article to describe someone in charge, male or female; it's far too casual.  "
101,"Why is that if a boss is male, they are just referred to as a ""boss"", but when they're female, their gender has to be mentioned? It would be great if the sex of an upper-management person didn't need to be indicated at all."
102,"Completely cringeworthy! Girl Boss is diminutive (also, the book was really bad). We are women.  "
103,"You know... I would never SAY it out loud, but it's kinda cute. I'm not offended by it but I appreciate the sentiment."
104,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts!  I've been ruminating on this question for a bit and have decided to put together an article that poses this question to a larger audience online and through a print publication.  It seems like a timely topic, and one that is certainly getting discussed a bunch among my business owning female friends locally.

If you would be interested in sharing your opinion for use in publication, shoot me a PM and let's talk some more.  I'd like to continue the conversation."
105,"YES! I don't have an issue with it so long as it isn't said in derision, but I feel uncomfortable with separating boss by gender. I'd rather be called ""A Damn Good Boss"" over GB any day. 

The GB moniker just plants an image into a person's head. Whether that's positive or negative really depends on who's saying and thinking it. "
106,"I am writing an article about this topic.  If you would be interested in sharing your thoughts, I'd love to include them in my post: [http://j.mp/girlbossorbust](http://j.mp/girlbossorbust)"
107,"That's the impression that I get from my lady peers on the entrepreneurial circuit.  It's said as a very cutesy ""girl power!"" type sentiment, but splattered across blogs interviewing serious business women.
