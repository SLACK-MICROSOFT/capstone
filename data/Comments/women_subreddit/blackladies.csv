0,"The FWB is getting a lil crazy. 


He politely asked me (in a roundabout sort of way) to come over and I said no. Then he offered to let me stay with him for a few months, and I said hell no. *Then* he was like ‚Äúonce this is over, I‚Äôll book us a nice trip and we‚Äôll make up for lost time‚Äù and I was like HELL YEAH. 

Also I don‚Äôt think my pets like me. Not that I blame them, I‚Äôve been down in the dumps and I haven‚Äôt been real active with them for a long time. Sigh :("
1,"I really don't understand why so many people are relishing/baffled at the idea of parents and kids going a bit mad during these current times. What generation has had to spend literally 24/7 under one roof indefinitely before? The frazzle and frustration, in my opinion, doesn't reflect badly on parents at all. All these people rubbing their hands together with glee and judgement are seriously poorly socialised. Jokes around the idea, sure, I've been laughing at my friend who lives with her sister, niece and nephew (who are all going stir crazy because they can't leave, she can because she works in a hospital and has to) but the non-jokes and damning assessments of people's ability to parent are really obtuse. I'm saying this as someone with no kids."
2,"All the conference calls I've been on have really stolen away the hours of my work days. Now I don't feel prepared for my meeting with my boss, despite putting in some extra hours reading and watching webinars on the subject we're meeting about today. There's just too much material and not enough time. I should have said something about it earlier, but the residual fears I have from my last job stopped me. Mistake. But here we are, and I'm just going to have to move forward. Maybe I can email her this morning and just say that I'm not as far along as I would have liked."
3,"I honestly hate my body sometimes. Normally I'm pretty comfortable in it but during this lockdown I've really began to hate it. I hate how my digestion is slow so everytime I eat it goes straight to my stomach and makes me look like I'm pregnant, and I have to take metamucil 1-2x a day for the foreseeable future. Maybe I'm feeling this way cause I'm realizing I need to replace damn near all the shirts in my closet. 

I need to go back to the workout plan I gave myself March 2019 and continue to eat healthier. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
4,"I'm falling really behind in my classes because of the online. It sucks. I'm overwhelmed, and I really hate all of this. I wish they could've just weighed our grades differently as a university because none of us chose to take classes like this. 

I was doing questionably before because I was being overwhelmed by homework but now that I don't have my usual schedule (which had purposefully chosen blocks of time where I was waiting an hour for class and could easily focus) and I'm also managing my siblings, I'm suffering.  I don't have any free time. I'm scared of failing. I hate this."
5,"* How yall holding up with everything?
* Washing my face in the shower, got soap in my eyes and nose and thought I was dying
* Had something called bavarian cake over the weekend and that was probably the best cake I've had"
6,"On Tumblr actually, I created a group chat for Black women!"
7,"Unconventional... reddit matchmaking?  What are your interests?  I see you're posting about Nova, my brother is just south of Richmond.  He's thinking about moving north of Richmond once things are settled.

He also likes running/keeping fit.  If you'd like to join his running group for a 5k in sept.  I was supposed to run with him but my local 5k is rescheduled for the same day...

(There you go, super-unconventional.)

Oh!  He'll be 28 next month, works for VDCR, also likes gaming/maybe anime (he talks more about gaming)?  He seems to be a pretty good cook, based on the pictures he's sent me.  

I met my husband in college.  Not much unconventional there."
8,"Online.. not sure if that‚Äôs considered unconventional anymore, but it worked for me. Now is probably a good time for it too."
9,I slid in somebody's Twitter dm's after I watched their independent documentary.
10,"I once dated a guy who made a post in the personals on Craigslist? Hahaha I was young and sheltered and looking for any way I could interact with people cause I didn‚Äôt have a ton of friends or anything. We met and he seemed to be super normal, met his family and all. And after four months he ghosted me and I never heard from him lol He ended up visiting the area months later and bumped into my Dad at a grocery store and apologized. He said he moved out of state and didn‚Äôt have the guts to break up with me. Awkward. So maybe don‚Äôt go on Craigslist. Haha. 

Other unconventional ones I‚Äôve heard of/experienced: 
* Bar Crawls 
* Sliding in various DMs on social media 
* Speed Dating Events 
* Blind Dates (does anyone do these anymore?) 
* Someone else‚Äôs Wedding"
11,Met an Irish guy at a rooftop Reddit Meetup in Denver.

13,"I've been part of running and cycling groups for a few years - nothing has panned out unfortunately. Your brother sounds really lovely, but too young for me. :)"
14,And then what happened?! Lol
15,Interesting ideas :)
16,Sounds like a good story!
17,"Good ideas :)

I don't think Craigslist does personals anymore but that could be interesting."
18,"Lmao. One of the most interesting relationships I've ever experienced. He's an interesting person that has been teaching me about myself for a few years but romantically, oil and fucking water."
19,It does not. However there is an activity partner section. You don‚Äôt have to one on one you can ask someone to join you and your pals for pub trivia or something.
20,"Oh, interesting!!"
21,"It sounds like you add a lot to this group-- they are lucky to have you, and I hope you speak up and educate them when you feel that you can"
22,"That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I took like one sociology class, but aren‚Äôt y‚Äôall suppose to study people through various means? Like, black men and other men of color are clearly taught and practice toxic masculinity. And, if observations aren‚Äôt enough, then testimonials should count for something! Women of color have been saying this forever! Not to mention that a lot of the toxic masculinity has been contributed to the oppression/colonization."
23,"I can only imagine! You‚Äôd think people would be more interested in seeing past themselves in this area of study.   

Thank you for sticking it out and continuing your education. What you explained is the exact reason we need more people of color in these fields. No one will advocate for us, like us. 

I‚Äôm in my mid 20‚Äôs and I‚Äôm thinking about going to school to study sociology. I have no degrees yet. Do you have any advice? Sorry if formatting is off. I‚Äôm on mobile."
24,"When taking classes that are directly about ‚Äúus,‚Äù I find it‚Äôs important to do a little more self-care. Decide what scholarly battles are worth fighting at this level right now; not every battle is for you and not every battle is for right now. It‚Äôs hard to do good work when you‚Äôre consistently weary. 

Know that there will be disparities and inequities at each level, and that at each level you will have to renegotiate what you are willing to do, what support you need to have, and what battles you‚Äôre willing to fight in order to be in that space. Cultivate a strength-based mindset."
25,">had the nerve to say that the author‚Äôs statement was intersectional

Yeah, intersecting the line between ‚Äúsocial sciences bullshit‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite people bullshit‚Äù"
26,"Girl, I feel you. I'm in the social sciences too and in all the women's studies courses I taken we have done no more than a quick mention to black feminism. I've talked before on the sub about my Whiteness class where I get to talk openly and honestly about race with my class (mostly white, a few black, a few Hispanic and a couple of Asian) Before the whole quarantine mess one of the last classes ended with two white women crying because they were ""offended"" by what we were talking about in class. We were talking about how there's a black student union on campus and the white folks were saying how they were afraid to go in there because they didn't feel like they belonged (this is a racial strategy yt ppl use to make themselves the victim in conversations about race) My black lady classmate called them out when they said this. She said ""Ya'll are afraid to go in there, but think about how black people feel when we walk around campus and we don't see anyone who looks like us, if you're scared to go in there, imagine how black people feel everyday in a white dominated world."" Which was 100% true and accurate but these white women couldn't handle it. They didn't even offer a rebuttal they just stormed out of the classroom and waited outside for the remainder of class, then tried to demand and apology from the the girl who called them out. Whewww chile .

The best part of this was my professors response to these white women's upset. She said that white folks should learn to reconcile their feelings when it comes to conversations about race without feeling like they are the victim. She said that them getting upset at the racial experience of students of color was not her concern and was completely secondary to what she was teaching us about race and whiteness (she is also white btw.)"
27,"' Then there is a nice enough black girl who has completely assimilated. '

&#x200B;

Assimilated in what way?"
28,"Sociology classes is where I heard the saying ""women and people of color"" the most. It never seemed to occured to anyone that some are both. Buy then you'd have to examine how ""women"" is default for white women in marginalized populations. 

Sounds like you not fitting in is a blessing. Let that frustration fuel your work, and luckily, school is only temporary."
29,">Wheww! It is hard out here being a black woman in the social sciences. These white womenz do not have the range.

Girl. I got my B.A. in sociology and this was basically my experience in the couple of classes I took in the Women's Studies department at my University. The first class I took was about the plight of women globally. I'm so glad I sat at the back because that entire class I was rolling my eyes. Every talking point was easily found on tumblr and none of them could think beyond that. It was just grown women repeating some shit they read on the website and thinking it was applicable to reality.

Another thing was whenever we read works by women of color they would always preface their opinions with, ""as a white woman I don't have the right to say,"" which for me was just a cop out for them to not have an opinion on anything and to rely on complacency. It was also an odd mix of PC-ness and general ignorance that made that class the last in ""Gender Studies"" I ever took. I didn't have the time."
30,"> My research interests black af, womanist af, queer af. I do not fit in. 

You fit in here at least.

If you choose the path of submerging your ego, you can go in every day, keep quiet, and get your degree. It won't be good for your mental health. You can also choose to assert your ego, let them know what's up, and if you're lucky you'll face some sort of backlash potentially including getting kicked out. If you're unlucky they'll just ignore you, which is also bad for your mental health.

The situation your in sounds like a more fascinating sociological experience worth studying than what you got going on."
31,"It gets exhausting being the voice of pro-Black women, especially when others try to tell you how Black culture is... like you have no actual experience. With that said, this is a reason why society needs sociologist like you. Sounds like you could write a research paper based upon the information (and lack thereof) you receive in class. 

School assists with  learning research methods and provides a spring board regarding theories in a structured manner, but it by no means is the only way a person can learn. You should actively seek mentors who have a similar passion as yourself whether at your school or elsewhere. Also, use this time to critically think for yourself, research, write and get published girl!"
32,"""They were part of the heist, they just don't like their take of the loot"""
33,"Love, id you don't already, do yourself a favour and speak up whenever they try to pull this bullshit. Bulldozing over how toxic masculinity affects black men. Just lets it continue to happen."
34,I like your username
35,this is why you don't study sociology
36,Thank you. I needed this.
37,"This exactly this. I really feel like your point applies to life being a black woman. It can be SO exhausting to always have to educate, enlighten, battle for especially in academia. I applaud you for mentioning self care. I remember when I was getting my MFA whilst working in a mostly white ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù job on campus and I was always so exhausted.  I experienced some disheartening stuff from all the ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù I worked with. I only wish I practiced more self care."
38,"Assimilated into whiteness. How she talks, dresses, and acts are more in line with whiteness. The petty things they talk about, she is eager to participate in. I noticed she doesn‚Äôt fully know how to take care of her natural hair. All the indicators are there. She‚Äôs cool though."
39,Thanks!
40,This is why my perspective as a black woman is useful in sociology.
41,"I think it‚Äôs just a way for black people to find community with each other. You could say the same for anybody. It‚Äôs human nature to want to associate yourself with some type of belief/group/movement to connect with others. With the decline of organized religion and the rise of the internet and social media, it might seem as if a lot of movements and other belief groups are coming out of the woodworks."
42,I see it as a part of the cycle of hope denial and acceptance. I think we can all agree there's a lot of Injustice specific to the black experience to fight against in the world and there's power in numbers when fighting against these systems
43,No I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs an ‚Äúobsession‚Äù because that has a negative connotation and I think all the things you listed are positive. Are you saying this trend is bad? If so why?
44,Yes I do. We Definetly live in a time period where being woke can give you access to spaces. I think it‚Äôs not bad though that people are trying to be more pc and accepting tho. But it does come across as kinda fake and performative
45,"We as humans need to be accepted and to believe others hold similar beliefs to our own. Its survival. The more who believe the same as you, means more of a community that potentially will protect you from ones who don't."
46,We just want change and we click up with whoever talking the shit that appeals to us personally.
47,"Not all the movements I listed were positive. I gave examples of more modern ‚Äúmovements‚Äù that spread online. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a ‚Äútrend‚Äù at all. I think people in general look for something to give their lives meaning. For millennia, humans have found meaning in god‚Äôs or deities. If that is supplanted, we can see people finding meaning through social justice movements or other ideologies that claim to make your life better. 

In the context of black people specifically, we are not just searching for meaning. We want to find a reprieve or relief from racism. I think some of these online movements isolate one symptom of the racist system we live in and offer a solution (sometimes a radical solution) to make you feel empowered and more ‚Äúfree.‚Äù I gave the example of MGTOW because I have seen more black men resonate with those messages. 

This is just an objective reality to me. The effects of this (this desire for meaning/escape from racist society) can be good or bad. Depends on the application.

Get where I‚Äôm coming from?"
48,"So your response implies a battle of conflicting beliefs. My beliefs vs your beliefs. Can you argue with someone‚Äôs belief or disprove it? I don‚Äôt think you can. 

I like your answer bc it touches on a really interesting point of contention in our culture. If everything is about ‚Äúbeliefs‚Äù and ‚Äúvalues‚Äù can that even be debated? Belief and value is subjective. How do you determine whose values are more important? How do you decide which values to uphold on a societal level?"
49,"I think you misinterpreted what I meant by trend. I‚Äôm not saying trendy as in ‚Äúoh everyone is buying this type of shoe now‚Äù I‚Äôm talking about a trend in the sense that these are similar events that have been happening for a period of time.

I understand what you‚Äôre pointing out that humans have always created different belief systems to rationalize their life and give them purpose. And yes in your examples this may have started with the black church but i don‚Äôt think that black people developing different means of fighting for their rights over the years is evidence of being obsessed with different belief systems. This isn‚Äôt us ‚Äúcycling through phases‚Äù but rather our tactics are evolving with the times.

I don‚Äôt think our systems are failing us. Each of these movements achieved things for black people in America. We‚Äôre still going because the fight is not easy nor is it over."
50,Always glad to see new works from her.
51,Indeed.
52,"Daaamn, they‚Äôre gorgeous üòçüòç"
53, Symone Sanders deleted all of her #metoo tweets about Kavanaugh after Joe Bidens accuser came forward. She is a whole ass clown who will do any for a check.
54,I am constantly feeling second hand embarrassment because of Symone. She‚Äôs the biggest dork in the worst way possible.
55,"I really want to know why she switched from sanders to Biden... I know it‚Äôs probably for career mobility, but she‚Äôs been going about it embarrassingly, with no shame."
56,"Live in DC and she runs in my circles. Can confirm, huge dork."
57,Background on Aya and her success: https://www.thefader.com/2018/11/13/aya-nakamura-is-flipping-frances-rigid-rules-beautifully
58,Wow. I read this title way too fast and totally misconstrued what was going on. Thought she was broke and lonely!
59,"As a Med student, this made me smile so much. We are 2% of the nations physicians."
60,Yessssss. So empowering!
61,Thank ya!!!!
62,Absolutely love this!
63,Very underrepresented! Thank you for what you've done & will do!
64,All of the days are meshing today. Bring back daily discussion
65,I'm not salaried and my job seems to think I'm on call. It's so damn annoying because I cant drive and my routine is based off of scheduling and they cant seem to get their shit together. It's frustrating. The unemployment site for my state is a lagging mess and I am just so damn frustrated with this whole situation.
66,"Well this came in divine time.

It is impossible to study at my place.

But unfortunately now I can't go study at the library or 24hr Starbucks either."
67,"I‚Äôm in quarantine away from my entire family so I‚Äôm stuck in the basement for another 7 days. Tbh I thought it would completely screw up my mental health but thanks to my aunt‚Äôs great cooking and people checking in on me for a couple minutes every day I‚Äôve actually never felt more at peace lol. The days blend together sometimes but I‚Äôm happy, I think considering how the past month has been that‚Äôs more than I could ask for."
68,"I started meditating this week. It's something I've known I probably need to do because I'm always thinking & processing so much information. My best friend always tells me I process things that take her months or years in a few weeks. It probably sounds like a good thing, but it means my brain doesn't really turn off. Meditating seems to be helping me turn that off & be ""in the moment"". 

Now, I just need it to be a daily practice."
69,"I'm doing well... But I'm really worried about older people. I work with a few and talking to them and my parents, they're just full of fake news and really stupid conspiracy theories. All they're doing is sitting at home, reading Facebook and watching tv. The other day, my mom talked to me about a damn QAnon conspiracy. There's so much negativity and misinformation that they're exposed to, and it's just upsetting for them. I know it's not exclusively boomers or whatever, but I  feel like they are particularly susceptible."
70,We never had that every day over here!
71,Yeah I know what you mean. Some older folks only follow network news and Facebook. They take it as gospel and if you don't they'll go ham on you.
72,All the black subs are meshing today too.
73,"My fault. Bring back *open discussion* yall still have
 *open discussion * listed for daily and on Tuesdays under the about  section of the sub"
74,"We haven't changed anything. Automod is set to post an open discussion M-R although it never fires on Monday for some reason, weekend banter Friday, nothing Saturday, and Sunday confessional. 

I dunno what you want us to bring back."
75,"I'd go to a professional. Bring reference photos of the style you want. Depending on the shade of blue, it'll likely have to be bleached first. Did you want it relaxed, or just a silk press?"
76,"Depending on the shade you'll have to bleach first.

If you bleach first, don't do any other chemical process (other than dyeing or some sort of deep condition or Keratin) to it. Especially don't relax it or anything like that, bleached hair is soooo fragile and doing too much chemical stuff to it will make it straight up fall out of your head. If you're worried, go to a pro that has experience with both black hair and dyeing, unless you're okay with doing it at home and possibly having a mishap.

(source: I've bleached my hair at home for years without much issue; there have been certain instances where I've over-bleached just a bit and it's fallen out from just that, without adding anything like dye or toner. I do mine myself because I have a buzz cut and I'm totally okay with accidentally screwing it up because I can just buzz it off again)."
77,relaxed then silk press
78,"Thanks! So that means I can‚Äôt straighten my hair 1 week after I dye it? And if you want to know the shade I want, search up ‚ÄòXiaoMei in Accidentally in love‚Äô. The first picture on images is the shade I want to go for and also the style. If you‚Äôd check that out that would mean a lot and after you can tell me how my hair is going to cope with it. üòä"
79,"Very happy I got my curls trimmed before things got shut down. Areas where I thought my hair was just a different, frizzier texture are now looking more like the rest of my hair, so it looks very coily, healthier, and it seems to have more volume. Has a lot of personality. I may post an updated pic to the natural hair sub at some point.üëçüèΩ

I'm also implementing more baths into my self care to give myself another opportunity to just be still & turn my brain off. I got some of Dr. Teal's Bath Tea, epsom salt, bubble bath, and some WoodWick candles. Excited to try the bath tea & probably look for a small business to start getting it from in the future."
80,"I'm preparing myself mentally for Friday where I have to wash and style my natural hair for the first time in a while. 

My hair is thick and long- so I will steady myself with water, old negro spirituals and lots of breaks. All well wishes are appreciated."
81,"Not that anyone asked, but I just got some polish from Honeybee Organics which is an eco-friendly beauty company and I‚Äôm in love. The polish didn‚Äôt smell super strong and gross and looks so good. It was the first time I‚Äôve been able to do my nails in years because of work."
82,Since i have to go to Walgreens to get a mop might as well put on some make since its just collecting dust....I bought some foundation and concealer from e.l.f this morning so I'm excited to try it....
83,"I put on tinted moisturizer and powder yesterday along with my usual blush/eye makeup/brows/lip color routine. The new cleansing oil I bought is not as good as the old one I had. It doesn't seem to really *penetrate* the makeup and lift it up off of the skin, it feels more like it's sitting on top of it and turning it into a sticky paste. Then it's difficult to rinse off. Maybe I'm doing it wrong. It does suggest following it up with a foaming cleanser, but then what the heck is the point of the cleansing oil?

On the upside, my face was lookin' goooooooood. üòÇ"
84,"I ordered a black owned beauty box off the internet but unfortunately they gave me the wrong one üò≠. They're sending me the correct one now but they haven't said a thing about me returning the wrong one and I'm really hoping it stays that way. They're good products but definitely not something I'd spend my money on. 

I used to not care about wearing sunscreen when I was younger but now I see how it could've prevented a lot of my current skin troubles. My face is two shades away from matching my chest and it's only gotten that way in the past 4 years. Im hoping by clearing up my acne marks the difference won't be so bad.

I also clipped my ends and my hair looks so much healthier. I see why folks cling to damaged ends for length but my hair has become a lot easier to manage and looks better with them gone."
85,"I braided my own hair right before the quarantine started so my hair is tucked away. I‚Äôm still struggling with baby hairs though. I had to cut my own because I didn‚Äôt have natural baby hairs. My mom said I left too much hair out and looks like I‚Äôm wearing a lace front wig. She is so rude. 

I‚Äôm usually really good open washing my face before bed, but I‚Äôve slacked on that hard and have some white heads above my upper lip popping up as a result. Ugh."
86,Definitely will be sending good vibes your way! So glad I started locs back in August. It‚Äôs made wash day sooo much simpler.
87,"Nice, might be up my alley. Thanks for sharing."
88,"Don't be shy. Next time he look at you, lock eyes and smile."
89,"Nobody wants to hear this but don't sh&t where you eat.  

Intimate workplace situation - that means he's a coworker?  Sorry, love, but that sounds like a set-up for the employment line or a hostile work environment."
90,What context are you all seeing each other? School? Work? Any mutual friends? Are you friends on social media?
91,"He is a volunteer, not a permanent employee!"
92,"I said what I said.  You never know if he will complain to HR (or to someone else who takes it to HR) and then you could be out of a job.  The rules of sexual harrassment still apply, even if he is only a volunteer.  If you make a move or say something flirty and it's not reciprocated, the best case scenario is an uncomfortable volunteer/employee relationship for however long he works for free there."
93,Wait until his time at your job is done and ask him if he wants to hang out sometime!
94,I purposefully stopped washing my hair for 6 months. Grew like crazy. I wanted to grow my hair long. I called it the leave it the f alone method. I took my 4 braids down every month or 2 to rebraid so they didn‚Äôt get dreded. My natural oils put my usually desert dry hair in the best condition it‚Äôs ever been. It was the best accident I ever discovered. Now my hair is long a f
95,"I don‚Äôt know how people can go months without washing their hair , I have to wash mine every four days because my scalp itches at day 3. Do you guys train your scalp or something or add grease? 
Your hair can fall out from pretty much anything if you don‚Äôt take care of it . It can also break off if it isn‚Äôt moisturized enough. Do you moisturize under your wigs ?"
96,My mama lost all of her edges wearing wigs improperly due to friction and improper removal. Make sure you use something like the Edge Saver.
97,"Washing your hair will not make your hair fall out. Please wash your hair. Its very important that your scalp is healthy and clean. Id say you should be washing your hair weekly, at leaaast 3 times a month. You might need a better shampoo and deep condition!!"
98,"Did this with a sew-in back to back, but only washed it to prevent the weave hair from getting gunky.

I got so much growth from doing that. Taking the braids out was difficult."
99,"That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm scared about that my hair will get dreaded because I don‚Äôt want to cut my hair off for a big chop lol. 

So do you suggest I just rebraid them this week on my own?"
100,You didn‚Äôt get product build up or have a stench coming from your scalp? How did you keep your scalp fresh?
101,"Yes, I use a leave in conditioner. But if it breaks off, then oh well because I‚Äôm going to be doing a big chop anyways."
102,Weekly??? What happens if I don‚Äôt wash it they often? It‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt know how to braid
103,[removed]
104,Leave in conditioner isn‚Äôt necessarily moisturizer but if you don‚Äôt care about it breaking off then you should be fine.
105,"Ive never heard of anything bad happening to ones natural hair from underwashing, as long as it's braided down. If you can't braid could you try flat-twisting instead?

Twice a month worked best for me, I find this time period to be pretty common amongst my friends as well. Our hair gets dry pretty easily so overwashing it usually causes breakage and fairknots"
106,Yes my scalp is dirty just because I need a wash. But ugh but like I‚Äôm just scared my hair will get dreaded.... I know how to properly wash and condition and straighten my natural hair.
107,I do care about it breaking off lol.... what do you suggest then?
108,Exactly I used to over wash and It was breaking my hair due to my straightening it. My stylist told me
109,"Sounds like you just need to make 4 sections. Try 2 strand twists if you don‚Äôt know how to braid. Use bby pins to hold em down while you put it back on. Cowash your scalp and twist  4 to 6 twists and put it back on. Are you able to do that? 

I have scrubbed my scalp with baby wipes before and it worked. 

If you don‚Äôt comb them out your hair may dread. I have to once a month. 

My hair is dry like straw and the sand in the Mojave desert. I‚Äôm unable to wash it more than once a month. It‚Äôll crackle and break. And I NEVER use shampoo. Only cowash. It‚Äôs totally natural 10 years of barely washing. It was 1 inch now its way past my shoulders from not fing with it."
110,"I think style plays a role for sure, I ussually do a flat-twist halo 1 week and then twistout or bun the following, that way my hair isn't too exposed to tangle. 

Everyone's different regardless of how similar our hair types may be, you just gotta find the groove that works for you"
111,"That‚Äôs exactly my hair girl! My hair will be so overworked if I wash it a lot. I tried it and it just kept being dried out. My hair is naturally oily anyways. 


Also, Yes I‚Äôm going to have to rebraid this shit again. It just takes hours ugh. Because I have to wash it and section it. But I‚Äôll do it because I don‚Äôt want it to get dreaded."

114,I wouldn't wait for him to get his shit right. Leave now. Why wait?
115,I‚Äôm so sorry about your miscarriage. I had one in February. Going through that can really open your eyes about your relationship. I ended up cancelling my wedding after mine due to how emotionally unavailable my partner was after losing the baby. And leave when you‚Äôre ready to. Don‚Äôt wait on his circumstances to get better to better your life.
116,"Well, I'm not one to immediately advise someone to dump their partner but when I read that you feel that he blames you for his car being repossessed (even though he could never afford it to begin with), it was my first thought.

>He got behind on the car note because I had a miscarriage back in June and got really sick from it and had to miss a lot of work.

Firstly, I'm sorry to hear about your miscarriage. Did he take care of you during this time and miss work? Because I understand why you missed work, but he maybe shouldn't have missed work with a 700 dollar car note.

And you're not wrong for feeling the way you do. Especially because he's walking around depressed and ""heartbroken"" but then doesn't want to pick up more hours at his job??? Do what you have to do. And honestly, it sounds like it's his debt, not yours. That's kinda harsh but you made more money than him at the time, you advised him not to get the car and he did it anyway."
117,You‚Äôre not wrong. Your happiness is the most important. This is not a healthy relationship
118,"I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. I had a few before my 16 yr marriage tanked over $ etc. it‚Äôs very very important for you to right now right this minute come up with a plan to become independent from this situation so you can live your life surviving on your own and not dependent on someone financially so you don‚Äôt ‚Äúleave‚Äù. It‚Äôs also very important for you to MAKE SURE that you put ALL THE BILLS THAT ARE HIS IN **HIS** NAME ALONE  SO THAT YOU DONT GET JACKED!!!!! Because they will hold you accountable for any joint bill that has your name also on it. I‚Äôm talking utility car etc etc. GET YOUR NAME OFF OF BILLS AND BANK ACCOUNTS TOMORROW!!!!!  (My ex overdrafted ours and they took MY money from my personal account to pay for his fk up and I was left with zero dollars in my bank account. 
Then make a plan to get to live somewhere where you can take care of YOU don‚Äôt waste your life on someone who is so dismissive of your needs and feelings. (I‚Äôm talking I had to go to the hospital alone on the bus for my mc!) btdt. Especially not your child bearing years. Get it together now while you still have time to meet the ‚Äúone‚Äù who is going to treat you like the goddess you are. Before it‚Äôs too late and you can‚Äôt hv kids. (35 is the cut off).  Time to take care of you and you only. Don‚Äôt be loyal to a man who isn‚Äôt loyal to you."
119,"What does this have to do with being black? Is this better suited for a different subreddit? Also why are you getting pregnant when you‚Äôre broke and don‚Äôt seem to have any savings? I read your comment saying that you‚Äôre dependent on him... and he can‚Äôt even afford his car??? As a grown woman you should always try to have your own resources instead of relying on a guy, even if it‚Äôs just some emergency money in a private account"
120,I feel so lost and dependent because I don‚Äôt have any money coming in right now.
121,"You make good points but your tone in your comment is so harsh and so condescending we can all hear it bouncing off our screens. You couldn‚Äôt have found a way to bring these points up without being rude and judgmental about it? She‚Äôs obviously hurting, she lost her baby, her man isn‚Äôt emotionally available to her, and she‚Äôs out of work. And she‚Äôs asking for help. Is this really the time to kick her while she‚Äôs down? Honestly."
122,"Well first of all, I posted here because I felt this was a safe place to vent. Secondly, I got pregnant on birth control. Thirdly, I said I FEEL dependent on him right now because I‚Äôm out of work due to the coronavirus."
123,save whatever you make while driving for instacart. are there any friends or family you can stay with?
124,"Shouldn‚Äôt people tell her the truth instead of writing a sweet comment like ‚Äúsorry that you lost your baby, sorry that your bf is a mess, don‚Äôt feel bad about leaving him when you can‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt seem to be very helpful. When someone asks for advice I‚Äôd rather say something that they probably need to hear. In this case part of the situation that she is in is her own fault and she should reflect on that"
125,"You should also post this in the 
r/AskWomenOver30 sub. They give really good advice and thoughtful answers over there. And they‚Äôre kind and empathetic."
126,You feel dependent on him for a reason and it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt have your OWN the way that you should. When you go back to work try to save up your money and always have a back up plan.
127,This is a safe space /u/TeaLover315. Find some chill asap.
128,"Umm where is it written that you can‚Äôt do both? You can‚Äôt simultaneously say sorry you lost your baby and don‚Äôt feel bad if you leave him AND maybe don‚Äôt ever allow yourself to depend on a financially irresponsible man? Or you just don‚Äôt know how to do both? 

She‚Äôs probably beating herself up right now. You taking a turn at her doesn‚Äôt help her self-reflect‚Äîit helps her feel worse and possibly even more hopeless about her situation and getting out of it."
129,"tbh, I feel like she did have her own until the virus messed things up. she has a car and she had a better paying job before being laid off. idk, this just comes off as blaming her when she just came here for advice. like damn, shit happens lol"
130,Okay I won‚Äôt say anything else. I tried to give real advice and I looked at the situation critically. I didn‚Äôt mean for it to be received as mean spirited I was just wanting op to look at how they may have contributed to their situation since they don‚Äôt seem to ever seem to call attention to that.
131,"Adding something like ‚Äúsorry for your lost baby‚Äù really isn‚Äôt targeting the issue that op presented to us. She asked for advice w her current situation and leaving her partner. Would adding something like that somehow be better?? To me it simply seems unnecessary. I mean, having sympathy for her situation in the comments is a nice thing to do but that really isn‚Äôt helping her in anyway. You‚Äôre saying that I‚Äôm ‚Äútaking a turn at her‚Äù how?? Nowhere in her post did she seem to acknowledge the idea that some of her situation may be her own fault so I simply called attention to that. When people don‚Äôt realize what they did wrong they repeat the same patterns. She seems to only focus on her bf and the way that he feels and acts. Telling someone what they did wrong and could have done better shouldn‚Äôt make them feel hopeless??? What are you even saying???"
132,She said that she has been having financial issues for 2  years (at least) reread her post. Coronavirus has had most people out of work for about 2-4 weeks at most. If you actually have your own money not having work for three weeks shouldn‚Äôt make you depend on a guy and deter you from leaving him. If someone asks for advice (when to me it seems like they should be helping themselves with their own resources) should I not say what I think about the situation? The clear issues? If she had her own she‚Äôd be able to leave this man who cares more about a car than the death of their baby
133,"But you didn‚Äôt give any advice. You basically scolded me for getting pregnant. You didn‚Äôt say anything helpful at all and your tone was very ‚Äúholier than thou.‚Äù I knew I didn‚Äôt want to be pregnant that‚Äôs why I was on birth control, but unfortunately, my birth control failed. And being off work for 2 weeks hits hard when you‚Äôre used to getting paid every week. So yes, these 2 weeks off did have a hard financial impact. You didn‚Äôt give a single shred of advice, but everyone else who commented did."
134,"I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt be rude. Obviously.  

I‚Äôm out. Good night to you."
135,Damn we can do what if‚Äôs all day but you ain‚Äôt in no way being helpful. You‚Äôre using the excuse of being honest to be hostile.
136,"well, she said she had a better paying job before she was laid off. to me it doesn't seem like an issue of not being able to leave him in the past two years, only now. it was a question about if she should feel bad for wanting to leave him. of course she should be self-sufficient but also being out of work for more than a week can still have pretty devastating effects. to be quite honest, it's him that needs to get his shit together if he wants her to stick around. and I promise I'm not attacking you lmao, just sharing my view of the situation."
137,"But I did give advice... clearly you didn‚Äôt actually read the other comments because more than one of them noted that I made good points about your situation, even noting that much of what I said was RIGHT. If you‚Äôre actually making your own money not working for two weeks shouldn‚Äôt make you dependent on someone else. You should have your own resources. Too bad you‚Äôre stuck in your situation and much of it is your own fault. Bye."
138,Ok girl. Have a great day!

158,"Be yourself. I know its hard not to see colour but try. Let go of the notion that it's this colour barrier that's the problem, even if it is for them, let it go for you.

And be honest with your white peers, let them know you aren't feeling comfortable and if it don't help, it's okay. You'll feel better coz you didn't fake. 
Former president of my country and all around bad ass, Nelson Mandela once said, ""There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that others won't feel insecure around you.

159,"I don't think it's anything you're doing. Unfortunately, we just have to be more cautious/picky around non-black people because we never know their intentions or what they're thinking.

Then you have those who, despite saying they are woke or leftist or whatever, will stay far away from you, as well, simply because you are black.

They also love for people to participate in the activities they plan so it'll mean a lot for you to participate in them. Join organizations for your major, or ones that simply interest you. 

Once you do, ask people if they wanna go to org events together, or simply say, ""I don't know anyone all that well yet, but I'm excited to be here."" That's what I did and now I know 80% of the Black community at my school and have met a lot of others in my degree program.

In conclusion: put yourself out there. It might be uncomfortble, but you have to do it if I wanna meet new people and make friends. Once this pandemic is over, join clubs and orgs! :)

Good luck!"

162,"I have way too much to say about this, but I'll just say that your last sentence hits home, especially right now. Evil is only a part of life if you keep accepting and excusing it, which they love to keep doing, despite it hurting other people. We don't have to let employers keep taking advantage of workers, but it keeps happening because a bunch of, usually white, people keep talking about ""well, that's just how it is"". Okay, but did you know we could change that and still have workers and people making money? Or how we're being told to just vote for whomever, but they fail to see that some options won't help us out, at all. Yeah, it'll get things back to ""normal"" for them, but what about minorities and other marginalized groups? It just keeps us in the same place and, possibly, make it worse. In fact, it will make things worse, all because they don't want someone making too much change that might threaten their way of life. I want to continue having some faith in the world, but how can you when so many people are against true justice and change?"
163,"Overall I liked the movie, but I did have some trouble getting through it in the beginning. The female character was just so damn unlikable lol and I agree a lot of her actions were what I would think to be out of character for a lawyer. Also the scene were the kid shoot the cop at the protest was...a lot."
164,Tbch? I avoided that movie like the plague. Seems like yet another ‚Äúblack woman savior‚Äù movie. I don‚Äôt think we should be caping for black men and i think it‚Äôs absurd she incriminated herself. Maybe I‚Äôll watch a review though...
165,"In the scene where Queen states she's a lawyer I felt she just said that in the moment (those were my thoughts when watching). She was more dominant and hot headed than Slim for sure. The movie was hard for me to watch, but I liked it. The parts that were hurtful to me was the snitch selling them out and the funeral for Queen and Slim had me in tears."
166,"i feel like some of the dialogue was forced, but i loved the visuals. i have a hate love relationship with the ending because you know the situation is going to end badly, but in the back of my mind i wanted them to make it."
167,"What I'm going to say will have spoilers for anyone who hasn't seen it.

&#x200B;

I liked the visuals, the music, and the fact that they went on a journey in the movie. However, Queen bugged me quite a bit. This is supposed to be a lawyer, and yeah, she out of anyone would know how crappy the justice system is, but at the same time, not turning themselves in, immediately, seemed like it created more problems. Like, you had evidence that this officer was acting wrongly, and we know how America gets when a cop is killed, so the fact that they ran made it blow up and that confused me. Then, the son of the guy who fixed their car. I get that he was young and probably feeling some type of pride that they defended themselves against this cop, but then *he* went and shot a cop? Like, how did we even get there? It seemed way too rushed on that side of it. As far as we know, he is mostly a quiet, obedient kid, but he met them once and just became bold/inspired enough to go shoot a cop? Like, boy, do you not see them on the run right now? Do you not realize you can go to jail or get killed yourself? That just seemed out of character for him, but just outrageous in the first place. What seemed more realistic was the people in the club they met who just didn't rat them out. Then, towards the end, when the white couple was helping them, why didn't they stay in the house and wait? These people had obviously done this before and seemed more knowledgeable about it than them. Plus, they were going to be fine; they were going to post bail and be right back at home, which is exactly what happened. Then, wanting to rush the plan. Did that not seem like a bad idea? It did have me wondering, was the guy who ratted them out even the original guy the white couple had set up or was this some unreliable guy they **had** to get because Queen and Slim didn't want to wait? I knew he was going to rat them out the moment he agreed to go along with the plan earlier then it was supposed to be.

Like, I was mad at both of these characters. Slim because he should have just given himself up. Queen because she was a whole ass lawyer and she had been shot, they had video of what happened, she could have fought that and, most likely, won, but instead she wanted them to go on the run? I feel like she only did all this because she wasn't in her right mind after her client was executed and she was in a bad place. Otherwise, I don't think she would have normally done what she did. It's like when you have depression, and any little bad thing immediately makes you want to throw life away and die; she wasn't thinking about the consequences, at all. It's irrational. I mean, she hadn't even wanted to date Slim, but she gets knocked down in life and suddenly, she goes on a date with him, wants to throw everything away, and, seemingly, falls in love with Slim within a few days? I assume it was her odd upbringing that also contributed to this (which wasn't fleshed out enough), but the whole movie just seemed odd. I'm just glad I waited and saw it at the $3 movie instead of paying full price.

I try to think of it from another perspective of when black women get their self esteem knocked down and have a bunch of problems we haven't dealt with, the first thing too many of us do is run to a man for validation and start living for him because we don't have the confidence or self love or support group to give ourselves the validation we need, and we end up making a bunch of mistakes that get bigger and bigger the longer we keep ignoring the real problems. So, we just keep running away from those problems, and doing this proves fatal too often, to us and the people around us. I have to think this because, otherwise, that movie doesn't make much sense."
168,"Queen & Slim is one of my favorite movies. I, too, had a discussion about the black lawyer and her actions throughout the film, which seemed out of character for an attorney. I think that is the beauty of Queen & Slim though. If the lawyer takes certain actions then Queen & Slim is just like every other crime movie or movie with an attorney. I think Lena Waithe (the writer of Q&S) was going for something different - a twisted love story; not a crime tale. Lena Waithe could've made the female actor's occupation anything other than an attorney. The fact that she chose to make her an attorney adds to the irony of Queen‚Äôs actions. How does an educated individual (Queen) end up in such position? Why did Queen help defend her uncle who was involved in the murder of her mother? Why does a man who is super family oriented entertain an educated woman who has no family or friends? Why does a white family go hard for Queen & Slim helping them escape the laws but a black man turns them in for money? Why did the black cop let Queen & Slim escape? This movie has many layers. After fleshing out the movie I came to the conclusion that it is a twisted love story that brings two very different individuals together. At the end, they both found real love. Slim fell in love with all of Queen‚Äôs scars. 

Also, Lauryn Hill's track ""Guarding the Gates"" bangs!"
169,"this movie fucked me uppppp. I've been dying to discuss it with someone :)

over all I liked it, I liked how fucked it was at the end, when they died *together*, and the dialogue. It wasn't very beautiful but it was thought provoking in a beautiful way. but I also like how much I *didn't like* how the kid shooting the /black/ cop make me feel . It made me feel something I can't exactly describe. This movie makes me feel some things I haven't experienced with other movies. Even if it wasn't too realistic. People aren't always so predictable, and I relate to that sentiment. I didn't predict this to happen either."
170,"I completely agree. That was one of my main points of criticism regarding the movie. I don't think a black woman that works in the justice system would act like this. When discussing this point, a friend countered that she was acting out of character because of the recent trauma she experienced with her case. Wasn't her innocent client executed? I'm having trouble remembering.  I still don't think that would've been enough of a trigger for her to run Bonnie and Clyde style.


The movie was enjoyable for me, but I think it would've been more powerful with a happy ending. The movie was already a bit of a fairy tale anyway with the unrealistic circumstances of the couple eluding police. Why not take it the extra step to have them actually get away, safely making it to Cuba to start a new life?"
171,"I posted this a few months prior, but, overall it was really heavy and I could probably only watch it a small handful of times again, but I did like it. I was a fan of the visuals and shots of their journey south. I really like the two leads and hope to see Jodie in more films. It was thought provoking and I did appreciate the feelings the movie conveyed to the audience (for example, the collective dread we all felt at the very beginning and the disappointment at the very end were palpable). My biggest criticism I have are the scene with the protest juxtaposed to the sex scene. I felt like a point was trying to be made with that, but it was completely off the mark. I also felt that some of the voice overs while the actors were looking off wherever was an awkward execution. And of course, the ending made me so upset, but it wasn't unsurprising. As much as I hoped for it to work out the way it did for Assata, I knew that the odds of that were slim (no pun intended) to none."
172,That's exactly where they lost me. It really came out of nowhere and didn't seem in line with that kid's character as little of it as we got to see. It just felt forced and weird.
173,Damn your whole last paragraph perfectly illustrates the past four years of my life lol. I'm doing better now but I definitely could've seen my path getting much worse just as Queen's does in the end.
174,"I'm glad you're doing better and on a better path, now. 
I just see it way too often (and a lot of these women are incredibly stubborn and defensive about it, too; my sister is one of the biggest examples of this I see) and see how bad it gets; the movie reminded me of it a lot, but then again I'm probably reading deeper into it than I should, lol.

Also, not saying you were/are stubborn, just that that is what I've experienced when talking to them about their situations."
175,"Thank you and no worries, I feel you. Tbh I was incredibly stubborn about it for a long time, I think I just didn't want to admit what the problem actually was. I don't think you're reading too deep, that interpretation makes complete sense to me."
176,"I am the opposite. I do true crime podcasts and I like hearing about ones that involve black women. For me, it‚Äôs about exposure. We all know about true Natalie Holloways and the Elizabeth Smarts because they were all over the news. What about Relisha Rudd? I never heard her story in the news and only became aware of it when it came up on one of the true crime podcasts I listen to."
177,"Yes, I agree. It‚Äôs probably taboo but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a fairly common phenomenon. I also feel the same way about talk shows like Dr Phil. I don‚Äôt like watching black people in those situations. Honestly, I think it‚Äôs more like a protective instinct. I know white people are watching these shows too and have a sense that they might be using the stories as fodder for further racism. 

Probably why shows like Beyond Scared Straight and Lockup don‚Äôt quite have the same effect. I know that it‚Äôs viewed by a predominantly black audience. So, it can just be watched at face value and without being defensive. 

Does that make sense?"
178,Yes I listen to a new true crime podcast called crime noir. It‚Äôs a black woman hosting. She talks solely about black victims.
179,"Yea I don't like watching it. It's kind of that old messed up  movie filming trick white people used. Let the black person die, the white audience will feel less connected to them. It's the opposite for me. When I see a black woman die, I can see it happening to me and I think about my future children. When it happens to a white woman I simply think of how sad a story that is. 

I hear about us being the victim all the time, I don't want to see it anymore, it hurts. It's like watching a slavery movie, I'm not watching it just to watch it anymore I'm watching it to be aware."
180,"Same, sheer-audacity. I subscribe to the MFM podcast and I relistend to the episodes on The Freeway Phantom killer and Mitrice Richardson. Almost every episode terrifies me, but also interest me- largely due to the personal stories/convos of the host and the stories (pertaining to the actual subject) they tell. I had never heard of these cases prior to this podcat‚Äôs retelling,but I knew that stuff like this happens a lot more often to women of color. All of the stories tend to bring out a variety of emotions, but I breath a little easier when I know that our people (and other women/other victims) get justice- or (especially in these cases) at least some acknowledgment of what happened. I listened because this a big fear of mine. And, I often worry that my case might go unsolved/untold, unless someone more desired/‚Äúinnocent‚Äù/(possibly) White fell victim to the same person. 


P.S: Don‚Äôt you just hate it when people try to act like you‚Äôre crazy or morally inferior because of your interest in True-crime? Like, people are all against consuming/capitalizing off of human suffering when it comes to this stuff; however, they are quick to forget when they watch, play,and/or read fictional (or somewhat fictional)        things of that very nature."
181,"I didn‚Äôt even think about it like that. I agree though, no one really cares when a black girl goes missing. What podcasts do you listen to?"
182,"I‚Äôm the opposite as well. I‚Äôm a big fan of the Crime Junkie podcast, and whenever they mention a minority, I always get excited because finally they story is about to be told by a wider audience."
183,"Yes!! Omg the protective instinct describes it perfectly! I guess it‚Äôs hard for us to see racist people being given a ‚Äúreason‚Äù to think the way they do. I feel the same about Dr. Phil. I love watching other people make a fool of themselves. But I know that when his viewers see a black person being messy, suddenly they‚Äôre the voice of all of us."
184,I may have to check this out
185,"Like someone mentioned before, Crime Junkie; that one is probably my favorite. And then True Crime All The Time and True Crime All the Time Unsolved."
186,"Haha, exactly. I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI know what you‚Äôre doing, Dr Phil. Stop it‚Äù."
187,So pretty!
188,So beautiful! Love your eye makeup!
189,Thank you (:

Why?

1. It's an HBCU - this will mean a lot to you especially when you get older and realize professional and social networks are formed early in life and you want people who really have your back.
2. I have never heard of Carthage and my hometown is Chicago
3. Atlanta - the Black mecca
4. Masters and Bachelors?  Go get it!
5. Who cares if you don't like the campus, Atlanta has other colleges - you can meet people from other institutions because again Atlanta is Black excellence.
6. The weather.  Lake Michigan may have a nice view but you will not be enjoying it when you are feeling the polar vortex and lake effect coming off it - the winters are no joke and it is cold up through April/May.
7. Wisconsin was named the worst state for Black Americans.  Google it.

If a school offers you good financial aid, good opportunities and stats that are valuable to you, that‚Äôs what matters most. You‚Äôre in school for 4 years of the rest of your life. What the school will do to help you in life AFTER you complete school is really what matters the most.

ETA‚ÄîI would pick Clark over Michigan for two reasons. Atlanta is black AF which is a huge plus. 2) you will be actually be in Atlanta, not just Atlanta-adjacent. You‚Äôre young and this is the time to enjoy yourself but also explore and decide if you like living in a big city. You won‚Äôt have to cross state lines to get there either.

The other school, you‚Äôll have to drive to Chicago versus actually living in Atlanta. Trust me when I say the number of times you‚Äôll actually drive to visit Chicago will lessen from freshmen year to senior year. You may ultimately move to Chicago to live, and you may end up wishing you were in Chicago all along, but as you get busier and busier in college, the appeal of driving to the city will lessen."
195,If the financial package is the same I would choose Clark Atlanta. Contact someone to see if you can do a virtual tour. I would definitely take advantage of bachelors/masters program. Administration can suck which I've heard about. You can find internships there in Atlanta and the surrounding cities. They both seem to fit what you're looking. Carthage does look appealing but I would choose Clark Atlanta. Ultimately whatever you choose has to be something you want. Take this opportunity to email people about what their college so special and how it may be a fit for you. Good luck
196,"they‚Äôre both pretty similar in finances. as long as carthage keeps their tuition down, there‚Äôs only a couple thousand dollars difference in yearly tuition between the two, but carthage‚Äôs tuition is a little uncertain because there‚Äôs a possibility they could rise."
197,"Sorry if this is intrusive, but are you paying out of pocket? I know cost may not be everyone‚Äôs top criteria, but it‚Äôs something to consider."
198,"i‚Äôm not paying completely out of pocket. i‚Äôve received a decent amount of aid and i already know i‚Äôll have to take out some debt, but it‚Äôs an amount that can be paid off i‚Äôm due time (it won‚Äôt weigh me down for a lifetime). my parents are also helping to offset costs."

209,I‚Äôd get this tattood or something. Love it
210,This is pretty awesome.
211,I watched a documentary on him.  It's crazy because he is from around my way. He was horrible and since his victims were black women he got away with the bullshit for a long time. Glad justice was served.
212,And may he rest in shit for all eternity!
213,Good riddance to a POS.
214,went on the original post and read how the LAPD considered the murders to be ‚Äúnon-human‚Äù since they were black sex workers. Disgusting.
215,Fucking good.
216,My heart goes out to all the unnamed victims and the families of victims who will never get closure.
217,I heard that he died on the news the other day and it tripped me out how he lived a block down from where I live now. My grandfather told me he killed someone who lived in my building some years ago which was crazy.
218,"They found a cache of creepy photos of 180 women when they arrested him (including pictures of women who were sleeping or unconscious), and about 30 of those women *still have not been identified*. Please look through [the gallery here](https://s782.photobucket.com/user/lpklapdonline/library/Grim%20Sleeper%20Photos?sort=6&page=1), especially if you are from the Los Angeles area or know someone who lived there between ~1975 and 2010. [This article](https://www.laweekly.com/grim-sleeper-42-creepy-photos-of-unidentified-women-some-unconscious-released/) has a phone number at the end where you can contact detectives if you recognize anyone.

219,Good riddance üñïüèæ
220,May he rest in piss.
221,The women who realized there was a serial killer were laughed at by the LAPD.
222,"Isn't it.... Interesting.... How the news story conveniently ""forgot"" to mention that all but one of his victims were black? Hmmm...."

227,"This documentary on Amazon  is not for the faint of heart!  

OMG

I‚Äôm not going to spoil it but let me issue a trigger warning for survivors of sexual abuse and violence. It may also disturb you if you are in recovery from chemical addiction.


There are a handful of survivors in it.  Keep yourself as safe as you can. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you fit a profile. Actively use Find My Friends and apps like it so your loved ones know to come looking for you if you are late at all!"
228,Do you remember what the documentary was called? I‚Äôd like to watch.
229,That's fucking grim.
230,Tales of the Grim Sleeper. It's on Amazon Prime for free if you have an account or know someone with it. Prime low-key has a lot of good documentaries.
231,Thank you!
232,Watching it now.
233,I'm gonna watch this documentary as well
234,No problem. Holla at me after you watch it. It's one of those things you want to discuss but not too many people watch it or want to watch it. üòî
235,It's heavy. Take your time.
236,If anything that I learned from this documentary is that all his friends knew and no one told. Crack is an amazing drug that will turn people‚Äôs morals into mush. I can‚Äôt believe all of his friends later saying ‚Äúyeah I saw bloody panties or I cleaned blood up from the carpet but I didn‚Äôt think anything of it.‚Äù What a disappointment in this community.
237,I‚Äôm watching it now!
238,"You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm shocked.  My eyebrows are raised above my scalp.

OMG

It is a full trigger warning kind of flick."
239,Crack really fucked everything up.
240,"Its so wild to me because I live in the area so just to know that if something happen to you, you just gotta kill the nigga and pray no one cares enough to investigate. That's how wild it is out here in these streets."
241,I paused a lot through it. It broke my heart to hear the survivor's speak on what happened.
242,EVERYTHING!! It breaks my heart. It really does. The community could have come a lot further. I would love to watch a documentary about crack cocaine.
243,"It‚Äôs really disheartening and backwards. On one hand it‚Äôs like, well why didn‚Äôt any of these people go to the police; the babysitter, the guy that cleaned the carpet, the guy that found the panties. Then on the other hand why go to the police because the police are gonna treat you like trash and try to put you away for some unrelated bull shit. If you have to save someone, you‚Äôre gonna save yourself first. Just like when you‚Äôre in a plane that‚Äôs going down. You put your mask on first. 
It‚Äôs all really sad. What a creepy and disturbing man. 

And it annoyed me that those two men blamed his actions on his first wife being addicted to crack and that is why he killed crack addicted prostitutes."
244,"I totally see why. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt watch it at night. I am confused by the son‚Äôs experience. He got crap because they arrested up on his dad being guilty because of his (the son‚Äôs) familial DNA.  

People really were angry with him for snitching?!?!?"
245,Shit any documentary about any good in america from the 80's to now is about crack.
246,Girl. They jumped and blames everyone but him. But we live in that mind your business society. They know they be doing fuck shit so they look passed everyone else's fuck shit. You really just gotta do for you out here. Ain't nobody gonna step up.
247,It's so wild. Criminal codes of conduct just never make sense.
248,"Oooh that's my lane!

In terms of books:

\- Everything written by **NK Jemisin** features black characters prominently with a smattering of lighter-skinned characters. My favorite are the *Broken Earth Trilogy*, and she's also just released a new book called *The City We Became*. She's the first AA woman to win the Hugo Award for Best Novel and the first \*person\* to ever win it three years in a row for each of the books in that trilogy.

\- **Octavia Butler** is one of the mothers of modern Sci-Fi and also African American. My personal favorite of hers is *Kindred,* which is a gut-wrenching story about an AA woman who keeps being pulled back in time to the slavery era.

\- *The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet* (and its sequels) by **Becky Chambers** feature a cast where most humans aren't white. It's a character-driven SF space adventure, very much ""traditional"" sci-fi but focuses a lot more on interpersonal exchange and growth for the characters.

\- I've just finished a fantasy book I've loved called *Redemption in Indigo* by **Karen Lord** (black woman from Barbados) - it reads like a fairy tale, and packs a lot more emotional and moral punch than its deceptively simple writing style suggests.

Jemisin, Lord and Chambers are all contemporary writers and I think all the books I mentioned by them were written within the past 10 years. Kindred, by contrast, was published in the late 70s. If you're into short stories, I can also recommend two anthologies: *Mothership* from Rosarium Publishing and *AfroSF*.

Movies are more complicated aside from the obvious (**Black Panther**), but from the top of my mind there's **See You Yesterday** (time travel shenanigans of two black teens with a contemporary political flair) on Netflix, **Star Trek Discovery** (which is a series) also on Netflix, **Luke Cage** (superhero shenanigans, also a series, also on Netflix), **3%** (dystopian shenanigans, also a series, but Brazilian with a mostly POC cast) **Pacific Rim** where the main characters include a black man and an Asian woman, though the rest of the cast is mostly white, and while I agree that's a depressively short list, that's all I can think of right now.

There are other series which I haven't watched so can't comment on, like **Raising Dion** and **October Faction**.

Will add if I remember others, and if you know more specifically what you're looking for, I can tailor the recommendations a bit :)

ETA: Also as you can probably tell by the books I mentioned, I spent the past 10 years trying to be very deliberate in favoring books by mostly female, preferably WOC authors, so my one blind spot is recent male authors. Hopefully, others can add recommendations I might have missed."
249,Nnedi Okorafor I sing her gospel everywhere.
250,r/BlackReaders
251,"YES. Seconding N.K. Jamison, Nalo Hopkinson, and Karen Lord - my favorite of Lord's is The Best of All Possible Worlds, incredibly sweet and character-driven. 

Also the OG SF writer Samuel R Delany for hard SF.

Nalo Hopkinson does great Caribbean/diaspora SFF, mostly YA. 

Max Gladstone's Three Parts Dead. 

Alexis Hall writes fantasy with a lot of heart, mostly Black and queer/non-binary characters. 

Kate Elliott is white but writes SFF with tons of characters of different races, many are Black women and girls. 

Octavia's Brood is a fantastic SF anthology riffing off social justice themes a la Octavia Butler. 

I've also been meaning to read more from Tananarive Due and Nisi Shawl. 

That's off the top of my head but non-white fiction is a passion so let me know if you want more!

(Also you asked for Black women specifically but Ben Aaronovich's Rivers of London series has a half-Black male protagonist and it's HILARIOUS. Modern day wizardry in London, cast of fun characters.)"
252,The Expanse on Amazon.
253,"I heavily read SFF, and [I've been keeping a running tally of books I've read with black protagonists](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4258791-jetamors?shelf=black-protag); I'm up to 236 so far! (Though note that not all of these are by black authors, if that's important to you; usually you can just google an author's name if you want to know if they're black.) 

Is there any particular subgenre that you like? One of my favorites that nobody ever brings up is [the urban fantasy series Shadowchasers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6611059-shadow-blade) by Seressia Glass."
254,"For shows and movies: Altered Carbon is pretty great, especially season 2 for more black women and characters. Silly stuff would be The Cloverfield Paradox and maybe Braindead. Short-lived, but I was glad to see some diversity, Nightflyers. Fav is 3% on Netflix, a Brazilian show  set in a near future dystopia."
255,Wow! Now that's what you call a list! I might seek out a couple of these based on your reviews - thank you.
256,"She deserves the praise! *Lagoon* was my favorite, can't believe I didn't mention it in my comment."
257,Came here to say this. I read the books first (just watched the series finally this month) and Naomi is one of my favorite characters in sci-fi ever.
258,"Haha you're very welcome! I was 100% serious about tailored recommendations too. If OP or you or anyone wants some, I'm happy to share! I read a sh\*t ton of books, and I'm currently quarantined at home with a bf that can take only so much talk about my latest literary infatuations, so I'm in serious need of some book/movie nerding out!"

260,"Great to see doctors like her working to get the message out there even while they are busy saving lives!  I'm in the UK and we were late in putting strict lockdown measures in place because our government switched tactics after realising their initial plan to let the virus play out was going to result in  250,000 deaths in the UK. We are now in full lockdown amd expect to remain this way until June. We are expecting the majority of the patients to start flooding in on the next 2 weeks. I think our country handled this very poorly at the start and we are still not testing enough people. These mistakes will cost us more lives as a result. We are now turning exhibition centres into makeshift hospitals and morgues in preparation.

Seeing what is happening in the US right now honestly terrifies me when I see that many places are not in lockdown and there are still people going about their every day lives while Trump refuses to acknowledge the severity of the situation. No matter what your government is saying, put yourself in quarantine now, do not visit family members or friends. You are just at the start and things are going to escalate very quickly. Please say safe and unless you have no other choice for work, stay home."

282,"Good to read that you are okay. Depending on where you are, there are food banks and pantries to pick up food daily during the week. You could usually find that on your municipality's website."
283,"Did you have any close friends as a kid? I feel like the most important aspects of friendship are the same ones you have/learn as a kid. Nobody teaches you. You meet someone, you just like something about them and they like something about you ( that part can‚Äôt really be explained), so you spend time together & get to know one another,, you‚Äôre *honest* to each other (as kids you tell each other secrets, As adults you open up abt personal issues, etc...) you accept one another for who they/you are and navigate life together with respect for the other person. Friendship is about honesty & trust. It‚Äôs pretty simple, that‚Äôs why I think books aren‚Äôt written about it because it‚Äôs usually pretty organic and humans are social creatures so it‚Äôs natural. Romantic relationships are much more complex and have a ton of pressure behind them that friendships usually don‚Äôt. The only reason I think some people have issues with it is because they‚Äôre too insecure to allow themselves to be vulnerable and let others in. That‚Äôs not society though, tons of people out here have friends, I‚Äôve always been someone with close friends, like the cliche person who can‚Äôt be single lol. But like any relationship, it can‚Äôt be forced or it won‚Äôt be genuine.

&nbsp;

Add: if you want friends, you have to go out and meet people. I‚Äôve literally met people because I‚Äôm out and see someone doing something or wearing something that catches my attention so I approach them and comment on it. I‚Äôve asked people for their Instagram after meeting at yoga or any random place. It‚Äôs not that big of a deal. If someone says no then big whoop, the earth keeps spinning. Also, instead of saying people don‚Äôt know how to have friends now, accept that some people won‚Äôt want to be your friend (it happens, I‚Äôve been ghosted by potential friends, but that‚Äôs not society‚Äôs issue, that‚Äôs that person not seeing any point in hanging out with me because they don‚Äôt care to be my friend, which is fine. There will be people you meet who you don‚Äôt really care to see again either...)"
284,"As someone who is currently navigating life and understanding what friendships could be, I would consider a genuine friend someone that I can let my walls down with, that I would unwillingly offer the shirt off my back, the time from my clock, while understanding through action and words that the feeling is mutual.

I think the issue with me is I don't really know who is a true friend until things go bad. The thing is, if that rarely happens, you don't really know who is tried and true, you know? Same for a romantic partner. The true test is when your relationship is hit with a storm. Are you still whole once the tribulation has passed?

I also feel like connecting as an adult can be difficult, too. I notice people place hierarchies on their friends (best friend, etc) and I just think I want to have close friends. I don't have a best friend, I'd rather have a cohort of friends that I can tell my faults too. As far as who those are.. I'm only comfortable opening up to a few. Truly opening up. Talking about things that make me deeply uncomfortable.

I found someone here that I believe would truly make a great friend, and they always reach out, but I wonder if that trust/ability to lean on me is mutual. I overthink things. I need to just take her at face value, honestly.

Basically, I just pick my friends by comfort-ability and honesty. Are they true? Will their comments/actions make me a better person? Do I feel as though I can open up to them? If they are those things, they have a potential to be a great friend. As far as whether or not it builds to something like that, well..

Sorry for the word vomit!"
285,"Hello there! 

In choosing friends, I think respect is one of the most important things. When you communicate, how do you feel about the way they're addressing you; are you seen and heard or dismissed? And I personally try to surround myself with people I look up to or admire in one way or another so that I'm naturally being lifted up and have good examples of the qualities I want to see in myself as I grow. One small example is that I wanted to try amping up my gym routine and I knew this other girl that loved to lift so I asked to join her in a workout session.

As for how I practice being a good friend, it'll sound cliche but listening is key. It's really important when you remember people's names, so you can say hello to them intentionally when you see them. Also if i talk about something they're stressing over like an upcoming exam, if I remember i'll reach out and send them best wishes. I find that the little things add up. And if/when friends confide in you or bring troubles to you, asking if they actually want advice or just room to vent is a good way to support others the way they need. My biggest thing at the end of the day is that I don't have social media so I have to be intentional and text or call friends to check up on them or send them a meme etc or just let them know I'm thinking of them and it goes a long way.

Hope this helps!"
286,"Also a strong loner. I'm starting to be known for picking solitude over friends so it's a bit rich coming from me, but I've yet to meet an ideal friend.

I think my ideal friend would be someone i genuinely feel comfortable opening up to when i want to even if we have different opinions, we make it known that our perspectives are valid yet we share similar moral codes. Someone i can chill with in silence or go on big adventure with. Someone who i can push to succeed without them trying to turn it into an argument and someone who pushes me to succeed without feeling attacked. I think we would be open to trying new things together and making experiences. It doesn't feel like they are always doing all the talking, it is a two way street at all times.

But everyone's ideal friend will be different of course. Some people want a friend to argue with, someone who just accepts their flaws maybe because everyone else puts pressure on them to change, a person to sit and do absolutely nothing with or do absolutely everything with no breaks. Some people don't want to talk about feelings at all. Even I don't like talking about my feelings a lot, so when I get a friend that is constantly trying to get me to talk about it just to help psycho analyze me it gets annoying, but some people like hearing a new perspective on their life.

I guess bare minimum for me, a good friend is there when I need them, and I'm there when they need me. They're not clingy. When they are with me, they are truly with me and enjoying our time together. They are understanding and reasonable. They are open to making experiences happen."
287,"I don't really think there is one good way to be a good friend and that's where the issue lies. You and your friends have to figure out what a good friend is to you, because it won't be the same for everyone else, though some things are basic. Like, it depends on how often you both want to communicate or if you'll help the through an issue or be the type who wont answer their phone if they sense some drama or respect or loyalty. You have to figure out what makes a good friend for you, then be it and expect it from others; everyone won't be your friend, though. Like, I have one actual friend, everyone else is an acquaintance."
288,"I‚Äôve only ever had good relationships with men (probably cuz they were attracted to me) and gay men. I‚Äôve tried to make friendships with women, but my therapist says because of the issues I have with my mother, it‚Äôs hard for me to trust women. Which is true. The women I‚Äôve come across in my older years (I‚Äôm 31) all seem to want something to benefit themselves (especially since I live in Los Angeles) I have a dry sense of humor and I‚Äôm finding a lot of ladies cannot keep up with my joking and sarcasm so I get bored. 

I think I make a great friend though. I‚Äôm the childless mother type of person. (My therapist says it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm making up for what I didn‚Äôt have with my mother) I love taking care of people, giving advice to people and sharing my thoughts and having true intellectual conversations with people. I haven‚Äôt found that in a lot of women. I haven‚Äôt found that connection. 

In my younger years it was hard as well because all my gal friends either transferred schools or I ended up moving away or going to different schools to pursue different things. 

It‚Äôs tough. If you figure it out, let me know."

290,"Most of you know but just in case:

Ankara is a 100% Cotton fabric in which a wax-resistant cloth dying method is engaged to seperate the colour into specific areas. As a result Ankara is usually composed of colourful, vibrant textiles that tend to be intricately patterned in (generally) West African styles. The design details that differed from one cloth to the next were, partcicularly in the past, inspired by and named after certain celebrated people or events that lived/transpired in whatever nation of the region that a cloth was created. 

'Ankara style' developed over time to refer to the trend of wearing such fabric in a fusion/Western type attire. This method of dressing is particurly popular amongst contemporary West Africa's wealthy, who often attend functions and parties in this manner. 

It has also carried out farther into the wider Black diaspora where it is worn in the same type of setting."
291,Oh god yes the little incel white boys with anime profile pics love to use simp. To them simp means a man who is empathetic or thoughtful especially if it‚Äôs towards a woman. Just gross.
292,"So, y'all have noticed this, too? I've been in some subs and these people use it all the time. I also saw someone telling others what it means and... as far as I know, that was definitely NOT what it meant. I was going to say something, but then I thought better of it. I don't correct because it always tells me who the white people are; they rarely know how to use AAVE correctly and it's mildly entertaining.

Like, someone I follow said, you know a good phrase/slang is dead when you see too many white people using it and using it for everything, especially white people you know don't hang out with anyone black."
293,We should learn Icelandic. That way we can steal a white people's language most white people won't have the wherewithal to learn.
294,Yo I was dead confused scrolling through sadcringe the other day because of that. Every title is simps now. What Black content creator did they jack it from this time?
295,Also some of these incels are 40 something year old black men that are still using the term/and disparaging men who actually want to be in real relationships....some of the annoying boys grow up to become nasty men...
296,"It's also still just a misogynistic term already, which doesn't help. I think Pewdiepie used it or something which is a large part of what jumped its popularity. But yeah, I'm really done with it popping up literally everywhere or calling every dude who shows any kind of woman any form of affection, attention, or even a shred of respect a ""Simp."" I find I'm being called one a lot more now and it's pretty tiresome. Between mediocre white people with anime girl avatars and a lot of really insecure black men among others it's no fun."
297,"I agree on the fact of wypipo ruining the vernacular, but the word simp isn‚Äôt at all played out. It‚Äôs been a very common word used in the MGTOW community for quite some time now. And that‚Äôs where the popularity & misusage is steaming from. 

Just this morning I was scrolling YouTube comments and some dude told a chick she was pretty and was IMMEDIATELY called a simp by several anime profile pictures. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
298,Megan the Stallion used it in one of her songs so that plus Tic Tok is probably why they're using it so much
299,I‚Äôm not sure we made that one up
300,"I definitely saw its usage blow up after some Mordecai vs. Finn thing on twitter went viral; suddenly all these ""simp tier lists"" started popping up on YT...quite bizzare."
301,I still don't know what a simp is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.
302,I feel like it got taken from the MGTOW movement tbh. The way they use it too when in context sounds weird
303,"I was always using it as a simpleton, until my friend who is a white guy tried to tell me to be careful using that word. He referenced the incel definition. I told him that this word predates a bunch of angsty lackluster white guys on the internet."
304,Recently talked with a friend on how hoteps are just black incels
305,That‚Äôs my thought too. I never saw that word until I was scrolling through the comments of Maury and Paternity Court on YouTube.
306,"Simp was used in the Black American community far before mgtow was even invented, my mom recalls it being used in the early 80‚Äôs."
307,Ugh yeah we can‚Äôt even say our own shit now. I don‚Äôt want to be associated with the new meaning. I blame the internet!
308,PREACH!
309,"Yeah, I know. We also used it in the 90s."
310,SIMP!
311,AAVE Gentrification
312,Love your eyebrows!
313,Mad as hell I don't have a sun-facing window. You look great
314,That golden hour treating you good ‚ù§Ô∏è
315,You looking great!
316,Lovely! üñ§
317,"Yes it is. Have a bright sunny day, Sunshine."
318,Girl look good! The sun rays compliment your skin so well ü§ó
319,"Yes honey, you better glow ‚ú®"
320,How do you get your eyebrows so perfect?!
321,You are beautiful! üåû
322,Lovely!!!
323,"Lovely!!! I do not have a window in my apt that gives good sunlight to take a pic like this. I'm jealous, lol"
324,Thank you!
325,Thank you!
326,Thank you so much ^.^
327,Thanks~!
328,Thanks so much ^.^
329,"Thank you, you too ^.^"
330,"Thank you so much! And I just checked your post history, your hair is all types of fabulous ‚ô•Ô∏è"
331,"Girl thank you ü•∫‚ô•Ô∏è I get them threaded once a month or so, and tinted! The dye has washed out by now but the shape is still holding up great. I‚Äôve had it done about five times already, so maybe the hair just doesn‚Äôt grow back as much in certain areas? In any case, threading has saved my brows, I finally look like I have some! They‚Äôre weirdly light and wispy otherwise, so shaping has been my holy grail in defining them."
332,Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è
333,Thank you!!!
334,"Yeah this window is my favorite thing about the place, the sunlight is really a mood-lifter on top of being great lighting. Thank you so much!"
335,Aw thanks! üíï
336,You‚Äôre really beautiful! I‚Äôm chillin but also ready for this to be over!
337,Okay I need your skin care routine like yesterday
338,What quarantine? I work at a grocery store üôÉ
339,"Wow so lovely. Just over here deep conditioning my hair every time I watch TV, burning through my gallons of water and finding new things to clean in my apartment üôÉ"
340,[deleted]
341,"I‚Äôve been investing my extra time into getting back into an exercise routine. I‚Äôll definitely have a 6 pack by the time quarantine is over at this rate, I‚Äôm finding myself working out for 2+ hours a day just because I live alone so I‚Äôm super bored lol"
342,"Lol, what quarantine? I live in FL where we‚Äôre pretending nothing‚Äôs happening"
343,you have lovely eyes omg
344,I actually washed all 17 goddamn inches of this hair. I have some Marley twist hair so I‚Äôm actually gonna do something with my head besides slapping a wig on.
345,"Quarantining with my best friend. I was worried staying with her would strain the friendship but she is CLEAN! I thought I hated living with other people from rooming with nasty b\*tches but we are having a great time. 

Keeping busy by applying to jobs/doing schoolwork/researching for my thesis/arguing with racist white people on reddit. 

My friend's mom has a lot of korean beauty products so I'm having fun doing my skincare routine every night. Stay healthy/sane gorls"
346,I‚Äôd enjoy it more if I didn‚Äôt have a full workload still. But I‚Äôm blessed to still have a job.
347,You're beautiful and you have lovely skin! Trying to use this time to boost my creativity.
348,"Your skin is amazing. 

I've been working too much (from home) and feeling overwhelmed. I feel like I need some time to myself. I requested Friday off, but we're all stuck home. Maybe if it's a nice day, I'll go on a solitary hike. I do need to stop myself from working all the time, it's hard for me to step away, even when no one expects me to take on as much as I do. 

Need a day of pampering myself and resetting."
349,"Okay, but you didn't have to go off on us with that glowy skin like that..... üòç

Been spending time with my SO. Also just generally investing in myself. Lots of reading, working on my Duolingo, pampering my skin, and getting my life together before my classes start up. Also trying to use this time to boost up my creativity."
350,gorgeous eyes <3
351,Your skin is glowing!! Glad to hear you are using the quarantine time well. I‚Äôm getting through this but feeling a little down lately. Any mental heath care tips you can share?
352,"Good lord, you are stunning, sis. I am good. Really getting into some beautiful revelations of my faith, of love, of rest... And really getting to know my roommate lol"
353,"You‚Äôre beautiful, I love your eyes! And I‚Äôm doing the same, but it‚Äôs not easy. I want to go to happy hour and meet a bunch of new friends and this time has proven to me that I‚Äôm just ready for marriage. I want that stability, so yeah I‚Äôm learning a lot about myself and working on myself!"
354,Beautiful eyes!!!
355,"What a beauty! 
I‚Äôm doing fine. I moved across the country to finally join the man of my dreams literally one day before everything shut down. We cook together and workout together every day I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better lockdown partner.
I‚Äôm working on my skincare as well. Can‚Äôt wait until I‚Äôm comfortable enough with my skin to post a pretty selfie like OP!"
356,"Wow, you're gorgeous."
357,"It's been going well for me. I'm still working (been remote working since 2012), so my usual day to day activities are still in tact. 

Mentally, I'm doing pretty great on that front. Still reading and writing and doing my arts and crafts (bruh, coloring is so relaxing and it's been my saving grace for years).

Physically, I'm doing great, too. Yoga and long walks with my dog have been my therapy, too, in the midst of the madness. Just staying centered and grounded with self and embracing the uncertainty of it all. 

Thank you for asking, love. üíöü§ó"
358,"Pretty bad academically, but mentally I feel much better than I expected."
359,"I had to delete Instagram off of my phone. It was crazy to me how many people weren‚Äôt responding to my messages and text, but they were posting all over Instagram. They don‚Äôt the excuse of ‚Äúbeing busy‚Äù ‚Äúat work‚Äù ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt see it‚Äù. This quarantine really has shown me who my friends are. 

Also it was annoying me how many people weren‚Äôt quarantining!"
360,Thank you! And yeah jus trying to make the best of it
361,"African black soap to cleanse. Vaseline coco butter to moisturize and a dab of Johnson‚Äôs baby oil for sheen. 

I take my makeup off with coconut oil. It jus melts off and keeps my face smooth/soft"
362,Ahh hope you‚Äôre staying safe
363,"Same, I hate it here. And all these customers getting too close just so they can harass me about how unfair it is for them they are limited on what they can get. üôÑ"
364,Stay safe!!
365,Haha I should follow your lead ok then cleaning and deep conditioning
366,I feel yeah. Lots of disappointments due to this. It‚Äôs not forever tho!
367,Yesssssss. Me and you both! Been working out everyday this week. Yay for those gains haha
368,Oof so ive heard. Everything‚Äôs closed in MN
369,Thank you!
370,Love Marley hair. Have a few packs for pony tails and such. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs gonna look gorgeous!
371,Thank god for clean people! What‚Äôs your thesis on? Sounds like you have lots on your plate. How are the beauty products? I‚Äôve always wanted to try.
372,Thank you! And that sounds awesome. What‚Äôs your medium?
373,"It‚Äôs good you recognize that you‚Äôre overworking. Self care is needed. The hike sounds amazing!! I hope Friday is nice enough for you to to do so. Stay happy, stay safe!"
374,"Haha thank you! 

All that sounds nice! What language(s) are you learning on duolingo?"
375,"Do what makes you happy! Anything to keep your mind busy and engaged. 

I like to exercise, write poetry and dance (by dance I really mean blast music and jus jump around like a maniac) 

Sending positive vibes üíó"
376,"It‚Äôs great your day to day work hasn‚Äôt been interrupted. I used to be a reader when I was younger & have been trying to get back to it. Have any book recommendations ?

Yoga does wonders. & im all for long walks. Thinking about spending a few minutes before bed to meditate as well. 

glad to hear you‚Äôre staying positive ‚úåüèæüíó"
377,Likewise. Honestly jus done stressing over academics.
378,"Girl, u just have good genes lol, I go near my face with coconut oil and I‚Äôm breaking out. Thanks tho hun go on with ya badself.


For the topic, I‚Äôm just working from home, spending lots of time with my 4yr old doing fun crafts and experiments. Also, taking care of hair much better with some nice low maintenance styles"
379,"I‚Äôm not because my town is full of morons, but thank you sis üôè"
380,Ughhh flashback to retail days. Such a pet peeve. As if you make the rules. üòë
381,"Cool, I‚Äôd never thought I‚Äôd meet someone from MN on this sub!"
382,">What‚Äôs your thesis on?

Ex-Hasidic Jews navigating modernity.

> Sounds like you have lots on your plate.

Send help."
383,"Trying to get back to graphic design, so Photoshop and hopefully InDesign + Illustrator. Love how easy it is to make changes to my work!"
384,"Privately, I've been working on French and Latin. But the SO and I decided to take up German together soon, so I guess I'll be adding that one shortly!"
385,Thanks so much for the good vibes!! It definitely helps! What you said about keeping the mind engaged is probably key instead of falling down a Facebook rabbithole like I‚Äôve been doing lately.
386,"Haha Awh sad to hear. Coconut oil is my holy grail. Skin & hair. 

That sounds amazing. Enjoy this time with your little one. Mine will be 2 next month & definitely need some ideas to keep her entertained."
387,Haha how come?
388,Latin & French are great choices. Speak a little bit of French. It helps having a good understanding of Latin. Do you guys travel a lot? Or jus enjoy languages
389,It‚Äôs addicting! I do the same with Reddit haha. But if you can try to go for daily walks. Fresh air does wonders
390,"Little crafts goes along way. When mine was two, everything was art related. I got nontoxic paint, a big white paper and just let her go to town outside then get a tub with water for her to play in after. Have lots of fun with your little one, they get big way too fast"
391,"The goal is to travel more once we're financially stable enough to do so! But we both just honestly enjoy learning, and I'm very into languages."
392,"I have nontoxic paint! She definitely loves art. Only been coloring thus far. I had more crafts last year when I wasn‚Äôt working. Made edible paint with cornstarch and food coloring. It was fun. 

Those ideas sound pretty good. Washing hands takes a good 30 mins as she‚Äôll just stand there & play in the sink lol. 

And as for growing too fast, I hear yeah! Crazy to think 2 years has already passed. Doing my best to cherish these moments"
393,Edible paint??? I wish I did that! Will use that idea for next science Sunday with her. Cherish it for sure ‚ù§Ô∏è
394,"Ugh. As if anyone wants to hear some guy just listing more reasons people don‚Äôt like black women. Like thanks, I was *really* wondering üôÑ"
395,"Yea, a lot of these men seem to be desperate for black women's attention. Its why they always put us at the bottom. We are top tier women, the prototype. Everything other minorities do we've done it first. I don't care who don't like my black ass cause from where I'm sitting all these women wanna be us. 

They want us to believe we're at the bottom for dating so to make us feel insecure. Date whoever you want regardless of race but we as black women know we aren't at the bottom of the pole. A lot of people don't like seeing confident black women. A lot of men in all races do this too. Its like they get off on our reactions"
396,"These type of people are so intriguing. Why would I want to be in a relationship with someone who only wants to date me because he thinks that he and I both in the bottom of the dating bucket? Like bro, you might not think people want to date Asian men and that's for you to figure out but I'm a hot ticket in this dating field and you got me fucked up."
397,"The thing that makes me sad is that the amount of black women that I've seen who come across as being so grateful to be appreciated by men of other races. 

While I understand the need to feel loved, especially when it feels like the world doesn't have your back, I also wish that we didn't have to be in a position where any of us feel grateful for just a modicum of respect or admiration."
398,Hasn‚Äôt he previously been called out for stealing content like Talcum X?
399,"I don‚Äôt even pay attention to this topic anymore, tbh. Just go out and date, I think thinking about it too much ends up making more black women insecure than actually should be. Men like me fine."
400,"Something that I noticed from browsing r slash Asian masculinity is that Asian men are OBSESSED with dating white women. I've noticed this in real life too.

By comparison, black women overwhelmingly (and sometimes to our detriment) prefer black men. I've seen black women turn down average white men for some below average black men. The ones that do want to date white men have no problem finding them. 

Idk, comparing BW to Asian men just doesn't seem reasonable."
401,Oh he's been an anti-Black racist forever. Like I mean YEARS.
402,"I remember years ago he was blasted for being a fraud. It was the reason I unfollowed him, though I can‚Äôt remember the details of what the controversy was."
403,I read some stuff in this guy. Sounds like the Asian community can‚Äôt stand him because he self hates on Asians and only dated white women in the past. I think a lot of people are seeing through his bullshit.
404,"I will forever wonder why people who dislike other people's appearance, find it necessary to express it. As if those people somehow *chose* to be unattractive according to your beauty ideals. (ideals which are completely based on their own insecurities to begin with).

Go find and talk to people you find attractive then. If you're such a ""perfect"" gift to mankind, that surely won't be a problem.

But they're too insecure and feel too ugly on the inside, to go for the people they find attractive. And they take out their bitterness on other people, by trying to make em feel ugly too.

People who make other people feel ugly, are completely empty on the inside. They have no self love."
405,My thoughts exactly! üíØ
406,"Right??? Like I don't think I'm bottom of the bucket. If Asian men think that, then that's on them"
407,"I have a friend like that. She's an amazing Black girl. Beautiful. Great personality. Talented and goal-driven. Smart as hell! She's the first person in her family to get into grad-school too. She has low-self esteem though. Luckily, she has great friends that try to build her up as often as we can. She's been shitting on Black men for the past year and a half because all of her relationships with Black men in the past were trash.

Now all she talks bout is how she needs a white man and how desperate she is for a white man. Lately, she's been spending a lot of time with her new white friends who don't even seem to be her real friends. They're laughing at her and not with her. The guy that she likes, he keeps stringing her along and then his friends tease him about her liking him and he gets embarrassed.

We've told her about what we observed before, but she got really defensive and told us we were prejudice against her new friends. We're not, we just worry about what this could do to her when she finds out for herself that there people only see her as ""the dancing negro""."
408,"I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised."
409,"omgg yes! I always thought that this wasn‚Äôt a fair comparison, and i hate how asian men constantly bring up BW being the least ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù. Most black women could find a SO if they really wanted to, but an overwhelming majority shrink their dating pool to only black men (a very small population in US already) and that‚Äôs their choice but that‚Äôs obviously going to make dating harder for them vs women open to dating white men/all men. 

In addition, black women who do date interracially tend to be the pickiest (rightfully so) and are more sensitive to any signs of racism or microaggressions from their partner and their partner‚Äôs family. This is the opposite from a lot of other POC dating interracially who tend to either ignore the racism or play up stereotypes. There‚Äôs also other cultural differences such as how white women are raised to ignore looks and settle down with the nerdy, ‚Äúbeta‚Äù, provider type when it comes time for them to marry. This idea has never really been very popular in the black community. If it was, i really believe that a lot more black women would be married. 

Also, Asian men aren‚Äôt really as undesirable as they think. In that okcupid study that‚Äôs always passed around, they rank last and below black men but not by that much more. A lot of Asian men for some reason have the incel mindset which is what mainly sets a lot of them back, but that‚Äôs a whole different story."
410,"I wish I could put this on a banner and hang it from every building in my city. I wish people would just work on themselves. I also think part of this is to persuade their friends and family to also think like them. ""If I don't like the way this person looks, you shouldn't either."" So sick of this."
411,You've given me a lot to think about ü•∫
412,I think a lot people think we hate ourselves much as they hate us. When they find a black women that loves themselves it just blows their fucking mind.
413,Sorry to hear that. All you can do is advise and try to offer a shoulder to cry on if things go wrong.
414,">Most black women could find a SO if they really wanted to, but an overwhelming majority shrink their dating pool to only black men (a very small population in US already) and that‚Äôs their choice but that‚Äôs obviously going to make dating harder for them vs women open to dating white men/all men. 

This is what I've been trying to say but couldn't put into words properly. Black women really aren't at bottom of the dating pool. I just hope black women find whoever loves them unconditionally. Also, I've noticed that incel mentality and obsession with white women. Its very.......odd."
415,No wonder you SISTAS always tend to have FINE-ASS non-black partners (emotionally too). All my RESPECTS to you for having those high standards.
416,"Yeah amen on that last part.

These people are super afraid of being alone in the opinion they hold. It would break them and make em feel very small, if they realised the majority doesn't agree.

That's why they will almost force people to agree with them, to create the illusion that this negative opinion is the norm among people.

Their fear of being small is the reason why they're breaking people down. Its the only way they can feel big, which is important to them because they **can not** handle feeling small.

Feeling small makes them realise that their inflated sense of selfworth is nothing but hot air.

Racists and sexist people do this exact same thing. And they've convinced themselves that deep down everyone is like them.

They do this out of fear of feeling abnormal, and so they'll stop at nothing to make it appear true.

You should never show your emotions to people like that. Because it's exactly that which gives them power to mess with you.

Because then they can see where your love and pain lies. And they'll either twist your love/strength, or use your pain/fear against you.

Racists for example really love when people get upset at them for this exact reason. It validates their existence...makes them feel useful in a twisted sense.

People on reddit are really bad at realising this."
417,Yep!!!
418,Love your handle :)
419,üòÇüòÇüòÇ thank you.
420,"Yes! This mindset was especially common when Pete Buttigieg wasn't gaining traction among black voters. White people chalked it up to the black community's homophobia, despite the number of opinion pieces and protests from black people about his neoliberal approach to racial disparities as mayor of a city with a sizable black population. They ignored all of that and still called black people homophobic.

These white people also ignore that Pride month and much of LGBTQ+ cultures were created by black people."
421,"OMG YES!  I've had to check several white people on that front.   I get so sick of their assumptions!  I remind them of hate crimes committed by white people on gay/lesbian and like you the laws created by white lawmakers.   That whole ""straight pride"" parade in Boston was created by WHITE PEOPLE.  One thing I learned is when you're talking with white people about these sensitive  subjects, where they tend to think they're the most ""woke"" people on earth, is it's a good idea to point out specific stats, names, crimes, etc.  Remind them of their churches and their religious leaders that push homophobia and protect child molesters and predators.  That's how you shut them up."
422,"Yeah, because they like using black homophobia to try and feel a little less guilty about their own bigotry, doubly so when they themselves are homophobic.

Us black lgbt folks got it. White lgbt people don't even get half our struggles anyway. Hell, even within the lgbt community of any color you have a lot of folks going at each other. Bisexual people get shit from gay and lesbian people for being indecisive or being told to pick. Trans and nonbinary people are constantly having to prove they actually exist to all three of them. Ace/Aro folks have to deal with shit from all over the place, then you want to throw in race into the mix and those issues get amplified tremendously. 

It also bugs me when they use struggles of lgbt people of color who are the ones who face the most discrimination and suffering to try and act like being extremely well off, wealthy living in a very secure environment gives them the right to begin lecturing other communities."
423,Yep. And if you notice they always compare black civil rights to their agendas too which is annoying. Civil rights shouldn‚Äôt be a comparison factor for ANY group. Just ignorant all around.
424,"See: Dan Savage and Prop 8

He basically said Prop 8 passed in CA because Black people were homophobic. but we only make up about 7% of the voters in California. If all of us voted for Prop 8, and no one else in the state did, the measure would have failed spectacularly.  But let's not let math, logic, and facts get in the way of casual racism.

Context:

https://slog.thestranger.com/2008/11/black_homophobia

""I'm done pretending that the handful of racist gay white men out there‚Äîand they're out there, and I think they're¬†scum‚Äîare a bigger problem for African Americans, gay and straight, than the huge numbers of homophobic African Americans are for gay Americans, whatever their color."" - Dan Savage

He basically said that Black people are a bigger threat to gay white people are than all white people are the all Black people.

He's since walked back these comments, but the attitude still persists."
425,"Not to mention, white people turn around and are like, ""why can't I get POC to come to my LGBTQ events??"" 

It's racism, Brenda. Racism is just as big a problem in LGBTQ spaces, if not more of a problem, as homophobia is in POC communities."
426,"White people‚Äôs ability to hide their bigotry (racisms, homophobia, etc.) in plain sight is not the same as being less bigoted ‚Äî but they would like you to believe so."
427,"Yep! And I hate it!!

Ive had to check multiple white LGBTs who would do this!

Like no shit the black community has a homophobia problem. Us black LGBTs already know that lol. But white LGBTs LOVE to act as tho white folks are accepting and not homophobic at all.

White LGBTs have to be some of the most dense, tone deaf people ever....they don't try to / dont care to undertsand our experiences / struggles while being black AND LGBT.

This and other white LGBT bullshit is why I cant really vibe with white LGBTs. At the end of it all, they still white. And it really shows lol

EDIT: heyy!!! Another Black Bisexual here!!!"
428,Yes.
429,Yes. Yt folks need to mind their own homophobes and let Black folks handle our own business.
430,"Yuuuup! I know ONE nonblack person I‚Äôll discuss homophobia in the black community with and he‚Äôs half Mexican/half Pacific Islander and very problack. He is of the mind that black people are in fact less homophobic than white folks and Hispanic folks and we have lovely conversations about it. (He‚Äôs very proudly gay)

ETA: so am I. Gay I mean. But married to a trans man."
431,Not to mention when we want to take pride in both our race/ethnicities and our sexuality/gender white people start talking about how being gay has nothing to do with race all of a sudden (ie Philly pride flag)
432,"I vaguely remember when black people were blamed for a gay marriage law in California not passing. We are only 13% of the population, but are even blamed for Bernie Sanders‚Äô lackluster run."
433,"Yep. I feel like the issue of homo/transphobia within the community is mostly connected with religious beliefs. All the nonreligious black folk I've met in life either were allies or lgbt themselves (like me). Meanwhile, I've come across plenty of atheist white folk who are still wildly homophobic. So whenever they make that claim (its even more irritating when white lgbt folk say that), I just roll my eyes."
434,"This! I do believe there is a lot of homophobia in the Black community, especially among men and in terms of women who won't date bisexual men (this is a thinkpiece for another day), but do you know how many white families there are that pretend like the LGBTQ+ community is cool, but they would just DIE if their own child or children identified with such a group?

Do you know how many white southern republicans there are that are homophobic as all hell?

There are so many white kids I've met in college that don't have a home or immediate family to go to because they're gay or trans, but I've met hella openly gay and bi Black students that can comfortably return home when it's time for campus to close. It's definitely nothing to brag about, but this is a POV I haven't heard from anyone before."
435,"Two things. 

1. If your experince isnt that of a queer identifying minority, then you probably dont know what its like. 

2. The black community IS homophobic as fuck. Largely rooted in the enforcement of strict gender roles and the policing of femininity and masculinity. As a black queer person of Caribbean heritage I can say for a fact that many of the older generation (boomers) have very strict conservative views that come from the misinformed teaching of the church. And this leads them to have intrinsically homophoc views and outlooks on life and how people should be. I see less of a policing of gender in the white community, not that there isnt homophobia, but its definitely a lot different."
436,"Late to the convo... 

To your answer: YES, FUCKING YES, FUCKING YESSS TO THE -NTH DEGREE.

I used to think that way about ‚Äúblack‚Äù homophobia, until... one of my good friends, who is white, told me about white imperialism in Africa. Long story short, white colonizers agenda was to control the African population minds via ‚Äú christianity‚Äù. That religious tool was weaponized to manipulate/dominate black natives and justify the slave trade/slavery, to imply black ‚Äúinferiority‚Äù,  and brainwash/persecute individuals committing ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù acts.

From that historical context, you can understand the attachment black ppl have towards the church. It‚Äôs sad that many generations of black ppl in the motherland and overseas have been brainwashed by a white religion, ironically forced upon us. That same cult that brought misogynoir, transphobia, sexism, homophobia and other ills birthed from white cultures and colonizers."
437,[deleted]
438,">***‚ÄùYes homophobia is rampant in the Black community‚Äù***

Well, when Black people go around saying things like this, can you blame white people for believing it? Yes, I also find it annoying, but they hear a bunch of Black people always going on about how *rampant* our homophobia is and they start to internalize it 

Honestly, I‚Äôm just as annoyed with Black people using pathologizing language about each other"
439,Not just Pride month but Pride as a concept/movement. Marsha P Johnson was a hero.
440,This. This. This.
441,THIS so much. It's infuriating!
442,Yup.  Precisely.
443,"as a gay low information voter myself, i agree with you wholeheartedly. i didn't support bootygig despite his homosexuality, not because of it"
444,All of this and thensome!
445,">One thing I learned is when you're talking with white people about these sensitive  subjects, where they tend to think they're the most ""woke"" people on earth, is it's a good idea to point out specific stats, names, crimes, etc.  Remind them of their churches and their religious leaders that push homophobia and protect child mole

This is good advice! 

&#x200B;

Also I live in Boston currently and it is definitely the perfect example of these ""woke"" white liberal types who say things like that about the black community."
446,"That ""gay is the new black"" bullshit was so fucking dismissive and condescending.

Gay black people: am I a joke to you?"
447,"Right, but the thing is,

>very strict conservative views that come from the misinformed teaching of the church

are HARDLY confined to black Americans or the Caribbean! (eg, where'd those church teachings come from?)

&nbsp;      
The entire meme is offensive. Like, I'm Jamaican, and I very much remember when about 15 years ago white people just up and decided Jamaica is literally  [""the most homophobic place on Earth.""](https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/05/stop-calling-jamaica-the-most-homophobic-place-on-earth.html) Fucking what even. Such bullshit on so many levels, including but not limited to: the obvious concern-trolling, the total lack of interest in the effect of this so-remarkable-we-gotta-repeatedly-remark-on-it queerphobia on y'know queer *locals,* the masses of people who happily rebroadcast that message despite never having been there (or going there specifically and only to look for that), the fact that it's queer *POC* who suffer the most hostility and violence in the US and worldwide but white queer people [consistently erase them and ""appropriate"" that suffering](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bc53v7?item_view=book_info&refreqid=excelsior%3A36ebb43fcf2b867e74602c66a7c2df4c), the looong tradition of white people broadly stereotyping entire swathes of black humanity while retaining the absolute right to be individuals themselves, etc, etc, etc.

I think the thing that bugs me the most (and it's a tough competition) is the combo of convenient ignorance/erasure of both [history:](https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/05/stop-calling-jamaica-the-most-homophobic-place-on-earth.html)

[‚Ä¶] The first time J-FLAG addressed parliament calling for changes to these laws, in 2001, they were not taken seriously or treated with respect. But the second time, in 2017, politicians listened courteously.

And it's exactly the same in America, where straight black people are written off as hopelessly retrograde (tsk-tsk, smh!), LGBTQ black people are all but erased (despite doing much of the heavy lifting to liberalize American attitudes), and white people somehow aren't involved in any of it‚Äî except, y'know, being the default face of queerness. *Bullshit.*

&nbsp;     
I'm not saying there's no queerphobia in the Caribbean or in black American communities. I'm saying the load of hypocrisy and bullshit packed into this white-twitter meme is pretty hard to take. I'm saying a lot of this chatter is fucking suspect; it's not entirely about what it's supposedly about. *Coincidentally,* it buffs up white culture and disparages black culture. And I'm old enough and have seen enough that when it comes to race in the EuroWest, *I don't believe in coincidence.* I'm long past giving the benefit of the doubt on that.

449,"Chile.

 I was about to say something but sis, this legit isn't true. ""White"" culture is as homophobic as any other culture so to put them on an aspirational pedestal ignores the existence of their homophobia, transphobia, and focuses on their token efforts. It must needs be remarked, there are plenty of places stateside where you can't exist openly.
Don't bemoan the sins of black american while excusing their white counterparts as last I checked, black homophobes weren't the ones who criminalized it, created propaganda to normalize hatred of it, legit let millions die of what was coined GRIDS later knows as AIDS, because it was immoral to help them. Like what are you talking about?"
450,"I don't think black lbgt people talking about their experiences with homophobia in their own community is the same as white people manipulating those experiences to further their racist agendas. Commiserating with others who've experienced the same problems as you is cathartic. 

The main problem is that it is not a white person's place to talk about homophobia in the black community as if it is not rampant in all cultures around the world. Them acting like their shit don't stink when their people are enacting policies to further disenfranchise the lbgta community in this country  is the problem."
451,"It‚Äôs important for Black people to speak up about bigotry( we shouldn‚Äôt be silenced), however we‚Äôre still not the scapegoat for gay politicians. America is very homophobic, outside of several liberal bubbles, it‚Äôs clearly not just black people who are bigoted though!"

455,"It‚Äôs one thing to talk about your experiences. That should be encouraged. It‚Äôs completely different to just flat out say things like ‚Äúhomophobia is rampant in Black community‚Äù. This pathologizes Black people. I see things like this said over and over again, and white people see it too

I‚Äôm just saying, non-Black people believe in, and have internalized this concept that the Black community is significantly more homophobic than pretty much any other community or culture because even other Black people are constantly saying this

I don‚Äôt think this is a zero-sum game where you have to either shut up about Black homophobia altogether, or you have what we have now with Black people pathologizing their own community. I think there‚Äôs some space in between"
456,"Elaborate?

*edit

I mean, by the posts here, and by how many downvotes I have, it seems to be that the majority of the people here believe that there is something pathologically wrong with Black people in terms of them being more homophobic than any other communities. Not only that, but people here seem to believe that pathologizing Black people in this way *should* be done. With that in mind, why would it be surprising or upsetting that white people also believe this?"
457,WHITE IMPERIALISM and ‚ÄúCHRISTIANITY‚Äù.
458,No one said the black community is more homophobic than other communities though. That's the point of the post......
459,"Can you link the exact comments saying that the black community is more homophobic than other communities?

I‚Äôve read the thread and all I‚Äôve seen is people expressly saying that it is not worse than in other communities."
460,I see your point. But white people are going to do what they want regardless of if we say it or not.
461,"I keep seeing people say or agree with ‚Äúthe Black community is homophobic as fuck‚Äù or the homophobia in the Black community is ‚Äúrampant‚Äù and I don‚Äôt see anyone using such strong language to describe the homophobia in other communities. I guarantee you non-Black people see this too

That type of rhetoric is why people think the Black community is more homophobic than other communities"

465,"Hi there! 

One of my favorite writers at the moment is NK Jemisin. She writes Science Fiction, but her Broken Earth trilogy has elements of mystery that might make it a good starting point for you. Plus she's the first African American woman to win a Hugo prize for Best Novel (for the first book of that trilogy). Plus she's the first person \*ever\* to win the Hugo for Best Novel 3 years in a row (for the 3 books in the aforementioned trilogy). The 3 books are

*- The Fifth Season*  
*- The Obelisk Gate*  
*- The Stone Sky*

I've also just finished a hilarious book by Karen Lord (not AA but black, from Barbados - like Rihanna, not that this has anything to do with that) called *Redemption in Indigo*: it reads almost like a fairy tale, it's very fun and surprisingly profound for such a deceptively simple read. The book kinda swept me off my feet, sorry if I'm gushing a bit :)

I'll be following the other recommendations, because I'd love to read some mystery at the moment. I still haven't recovered from when I found out the writer of the Smokey Dalton series is a white woman."

But I just...I feel like I still need time to recover from the abuse of my old job before I can generate the energy necessary to do things that generate energy, if that makes sense. It's like being too ill to exercise, or something. Generally exercise is going to make you feel better in the long run, but getting up to do it is *really* hard, if not impossible, if you're depressed enough, or physically ill. I feel like maybe I shouldn't lift weights until this broken bone heals. 

Doesn't help that I have shitty self-bought gap insurance right now and can't see my therapist. But oh well, I'll get through it."

A few weeks ago I had what I‚Äôm pretty sure is a migraine for the first time. Only, the pain seems to be more centered between my eyes and kind of radiates outwards with this intense sinus pressure. Not sure what triggers it at all, but I wonder if the two are connected in anyway."

I did try to go down the writer path, and I‚Äôm finishing an MFA, but I only write the night before I have to turn in a story for workshop. I‚Äôve still never completed a novel despite various starts. I only use my free time to think about all the things I want to be/do. I just YouTube random hobbies and get obsessed temporarily.

489,"I may regret this, but I think I figured out why I'm still a virgin at almost 29...and I think it's good I figured it out but I still have some reservations. 

#1: I'm not straight and it took me up to basically now to figure that out & be okay with what that means. Feels like I've been around the world with this concept alone.

#2: I think I might be demisexual(?). It seems I don't think about most people sexually until after I feel I know them well enough. There are edge cases but not too many. I'm looking into this.

#3: For some reason, I feel very confident I would know what to do in bed, but I'm overwhelmed by my own sexual energy at the same time. I worry about unleashing 29 years of thoughts onto an unsuspecting woman. But how will I ever do it if I stay in that mindset?

So idk... feels like a long, long road. Not to mention people make assumptions about virgins, especially those at my age, & that is exhausting to combat on it's own when dating. I think if I liked someone (and they liked me) & I knew they'd be cool with possibly being ravaged, I'd be fine. I think it'll be a while longer before I either fix the problem or meet someone I'm comfortable with."
490,"Although this isn‚Äôt brand new behavior AT ALL, being reminded of why my relationship with my narcissistic/self-centered parents still stings.

It hurts that I am not in a position to have him with me, so it is really  important for me to ‚Äústay in touch‚Äù with him, so I will ask them to send me photos or videos. My last ask was about a month ago, and I just got the picture. This has been going on for so long and I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised but it hurts every time. They know it is important to me, I have directly stated it, but they can‚Äôt be assed to give me this one concession.

We just got done with a family Zoom (with some extended family). I asked if they could video chat me real quick so I could see the dog. My mom immediately says ‚ÄúNo, no, I have to start cooking now. I can do it after I‚Äôve eaten dinner.‚Äù I said, I can‚Äôt have 5 more minutes of your time? 

But then again, these are the same folks who felt like giving me the bare minimum food and shelter growing up was something that I ‚Äúowe‚Äù them for."
491,"I'm a guy, late 30's. Had so many body issues myself. As a teenager I was pretty tall, but also really skinny. And people will underestimate it, but you go through the same pain as someone who feels too short or feel too overweight.

But anyway. I guess I filled out decently, but the essence of that insecurity doesn't ever go away, but it also doesn't need to. At all.

I started properly dating late 20's. (I was basically 29). And I just realised that my attraction toward women has literally ZERO to do with what their body or face looks like. It's like: Some people you like, and get along with. Some people you don't.

But it never has to do with appearance, and the only people who say that it is about appearance, are just immature people who're out to please themselves, and get an ego boost for themselves. 

The see it as a reward to the ego, to get to have sex with someone who fullfils beauty ideals. Because: ""that must mean I'm goodlooking too"". No, you're both just insecure on a profound level, and too shallow to realise it. 

It's all such a bunch of crap. Because people who find appearance that important, are actually the weak ones. Because its them that start tripping, and can't get turned-on if certain ideals aren't met. 

It's them who feel ugly, and are desperate for someone to make em feel pretty. I guess so they wouldn't hear the silence of all that emptiness where a personality should be?

Women with weird/imperfect butts, boobs, legs, hairy nipples, you name it. It doesn't mean a thing as long as you know what kindness is. What self-care is. What being able to empathise with people means... 

Now that stuff is what makes you SUPER attractive. I've always been a guy who loves nothing more than being able make someone happy who appreciates it. Someone who doesn't see all things I do, as normal/as if they deserve it, because they think they're better than others...

So many people walk around like that. They think they deserve certain things, because they have the privilege of money or beauty ideals or both.

Women like that don't turn me on in the slightest. They're boring as heck and they can go have sex with themselves for all I care. It's also impossible to fall inlove with someone like that, because they have no personality or feelings to connect to.

It doesn't matter what you look like. Because if you're a person who's empathic and respectful towards life and people, you're always gonna suffer regardless of apperance. Because this world is full of shallow ignorant people who need to stigmatise everyone else.

You could've been a model in Paris. It's the fact that you're able to feel love, that you're able to feel pain. The mistake you make is thinking you did somehting wrong/deserve it somehow. It all has literally nothing to do with your actual physical self.

But that's the excuse these people will use. ""You're ugly therefor you deserve to be hurt"". No logic at all. Should be legal to just smack these people in the face. ""You talk shit, you get slapped across the face!"".

long story short: When it comes to my body and appearance: I quit feeling both bad and good. Because it's completely useless and completely irrelevant if you want love, respect, and good quality sex. Because those things actually require maturity. And you can't mature, if you're either stressing about ""ugliness"", nor if you're full of yourself.

Women who specifically want a tall dude, can forget about it. I wanna be seen as a person. Women who just want a hard dick, can also forget about it. Women who want me to do all sorts but can't give back in kind, can forget about it....

And it took me a long time to get there. Because I too made the mistake of thinking getting attention is the same as love. I too stuck around for too long despite red flags everywhere. And so on.

But I got over it. Got to know myself, still have lots of great memories. And all my mistakes made me stronger and wiser. 

Personality is where it's at. The rest is just bullshit in your head, put there by people who're afraid of us seeing how weak they are on the inside. People who project negativity are afraid of you. Cause you have depth, and they don't.

This was me as a teen: https://imgur.com/fa7rrGY

498,"I had that exact same thing happen (and it happens every so often). It felt like my brain was a bit ""foggy"" due to a light headache and I'd stumble over words more than usual 

For me, it seems to be tied to stress, as when I moved out for college, it stopped.

510,"Thanks for the feedback. I agree! I think I just struggle with whether or not this is a higher standard that I consciously set, or if I'm actually just repressing my feelings. I do have friends with a difference of opinion that say virginity doesn't exist & you should just do it when you feel like it, but that doesn't seem like the way my mind works. Hopefully things work well for me the way they have for your friends!"
511,"Yeah reason I finally started dating late 20's, is because I found out about feminism on reddit a year or two prior. Which gave me a normal sense of worth for the first time in my life.

I just suddenly found so much to relate to, because I too got objectifeid for sex when I was 19. Didn't enjoy it at all, thought there was somehting wrong with me/""not a real man who goes bang women left and right""... Anyway, it was such a relief to see people be decent humanbeings towards eachother. That type of love, decency, maturity, openess... is something that is so rare in the proverbial 'world of men'. 

And I know for a fact deep down all men crave this. They just don't wanna admit it, because they think it makes them look weak. And looking weak means women won't like you. Which means no sex! (It's backwards as fuck obviously).

I felt so lost in life, and I'd browse the front page of r/all for hours on end. Well into the night. It was easy to make comments on reddit that got upvoted, but I felt empty about it. At one point I'd be coming across the r/makeupaddiction posts, and I'd go in the thread and vibe was sooo nice there. 

Saw someone mentioning some feminist sub, and it was like finding a oasis in the desert. Man I had so much fun/deep feelings of joy, allowing that openness to happen in myself. And learning to communicate, and to actually set your own preconceived notions aside, so you can actually listen what another person is saying/experiencing in life.

Now little over 10 years later, and I realise that all this toxicity is created by both sexist men *and* women. And women are definitely communicating about it, and taking care of eachother and keep pushing forward for more freedom and openness.... but men are nowhere to be found it seems...

The amount of psychological darkness that men will go through, because body shame, because sexual shame, feelings of pure and utter worthlessness and so on... is not at all properly spoken about.

The amount of male-on-male oppression is insane, and it's literally a vicious cycle of guys not feeling valid as men, and therfor behaving in a way that will only make em feel even less valid as men. 

Eventhough it's all about feeling human, and discovering who you truly are without all that need for shame and self-improvement, and to learn to be fine about it. To know it's your right to fine with it, and that you're not alone.

And so many of em trapped in the belief that women don't/can't understand it. That women hate them for being flawed. That they're the only guy going through it. And so on.

Self-hate is so problematic because you either end-up destroying yourself, or you start projecting it on others. Blaming others for it.

And people won't put up with it, so ofcourse to a toxic mind that only seems to confirm that indeed these people hate you. They don't hate you, they hate your behavior and the fact that you're blind that your ability to complain is a priviledge.

Women who get abused can't live in hate. People who face racism can't live in hate. Gay people, just the same.

Yet here you got guys who've had a pretty easy life in comparison to women who start getting harassed the day they sprout a hint of boobs, and these guys think their situation is completely hopeless, and that women should take care of all their needs because of it. 

Anyways. I thank you for the feedback. Makes me happy. 
I think I mostly do this for my own sanity. It actually really sucks sometimes, not to able to relate to other men about this stuff. It feels weird/almost as if I'm the abnormal one or an alien you know?

It'll be okay though. I'm sure I'll come across my people one day."

513,I wasn't raised to put that religious spin on virginity. I was always more curious about sex than I was to hold on to it. Only reason I made it out of high school in tact was because the dude I wanted was at another school and I wasn't about to be fucking in cars and bathrooms like my peers. Early on in the game I realized the sex wasn't worth it to me if I wasn't interested in the dude. You may have to have a different connection and that's ok. You'll figure out your wants and needs.
514,Hahaha right!
515,"This was helpful, thank you!"
516,"Focus on doing your best in school, and worry about what the parents think later. There‚Äôs always an awkward and challenging adjustment period in relating to one‚Äôs parents as an adult, but you‚Äôll be on the best path as long as you remain true to yourself and set boundaries.


For example my parents are religious Trump conservatives who want many grandchildren, whereas I‚Äôm a decidedly irreligious Berniecrat who could go either way with having kids. Our boundaries are to not talk about religion or politics. 

It took several years to set my boundaries, and many tears and heartache. Just give them love and understanding and you‚Äôll get through it like I did."
517,"Gently start preparing her now by letting her know how you feel. You may change your mind. You probably won't but if you do, she's off your back.  If you don't, you've been telling her for years so eventually she will believe it when you don't have kids. I'm 32 with no kids. I knew at an early age I didn't want kids. Whenever I was asked about kids I've always said, ""I don't think kids fit into the life I want."" It took years but people stopped asking me about kids."
518,"I have a similar background -- Muslim mother from West Africa, and eldest girl of the siblings so I'm very acquainted with (and still often play) the ""parent"" role. But I think where you and I stray from each other is that very early on, I knew I wouldn't do the things my parents expected of me in adulthood, which informs my response to your situation --> Do whatever you want, your parents will get over it üòÖ

You're actually sort of in a good spot for this because you are the eldest, so they can just shift their hopes for grandchildren into your younger siblings (sorry kiddos). They'll definitely harass you a bit, which can hurt, but ultimately it is your life, and you've already done so much for them by taking on that parent role. Don't feel obligated to sacrifice the rest of your life and your future aspirations to make them happy -- you've already given them your childhood. Don't let them make you feel guilty for wanting to live your own life for the first time."
519,"First, are your parents helping you pay for school, and if so will informing them about how you see your life cause them to withhold payment/financial support?


If the answer is **yes** to the question above: 


**Don‚Äôt tell your parents anything**. Focus on your school work and building a base of support through your friends. During the summer get a job, if you can, and save money. Once you finish with school and don‚Äôt dependent on your parents financially you could start a discussion on what you want in life!



If the answer is **no** to the question above:

Think about how you tell your parents. If you think the pressure you get from them might be to much and interfere with your studies: now may not be the time to tell them? Only you know when talking to them would be a good idea.



Also I would suggest therapy. Usually campuses have counseling for students. It might be a good idea to explore before/during/after any fallout. Just remember your campus has a lot of resources for students, and if you have a trusted advisor or mentor to talk to even better! (I know campuses are closed right now, so this would probably be for when students return)."
520,You should post this to r/childfree
521,Bernicrats unite! ü§ù
522,"> Do whatever you want, your parents will get over it

So, so, _sooo_ true! How many stories can we tell of the 1st sibling who had the strictest rules, the least freedom, and the most responsibility? By the time your 3rd sibling is your age, they would have softened up their stance. By the time the youngest is your age, their behaviour and attitudes at that time will look nothing like they do now.

Consider yourself as doing them and your younger siblings (and yourself) a favour in the long run, OP!"
523,Solid advice
524,And r/truechildfree!
525,"It's not snitching. The moment someone has me doing more work because they aren't doing their work I'm letting everyone know. First occurrence, first group meeting I'm airing shit out. You either going to do your job or you can find another. It's really that cut and dry out here. Race, gender, sexual orientation is none of my business, you making more work for me is all of my business."
526,You already put way too much of your neck on the line for her. Don‚Äôt mess around and let her throw you under the bus too.
527,Does she do anything workwise that warrants her continued employment? It sounds like shes more headache than asset.
528,"No. If you're doing her work and yours, your unnecessarily creating more stress for yourself and the team. 
I don't care what race or ethnicity someone is- I'm not bending over backwards to help if they can't help themselves.
What's most striking is that her interpersonal issues are with 3 other black women- they know she's no good and it's not fair for them to that she is not facing the appropriate consequences for her actions.
Yes it's a terrible time to get fired but in her case I think it will serve as a wake-up call."
529,"Let her get fired. You've stuck your neck out way too many times for her and she clearly doesn't care. You can only support someone so much. If she doesn't care about her performance, why should you. She's going to keep doing it cause you're still doing her work and covering for her. Tell your manager the truth. You can only do so much, at the end of the day she has to be willing to change, and she's clearly not. Your reputation may also be on the line. I know it sucks, I want to see our people doing good but sometimes you can't help everybody. You might feel bad for getting her fired but honestly she got herself fired. She has to be somewhat self aware."
530,"As a people we must support one another, but at the same time support has to be earned. If anyone takes advantage of you looking out, cut them off. Go to your manager, let him know your recommendation, give the steps you had taken to remedy the situation, and thoughts on what should happen next. No one should get in the way of your moves."
531,"Honestly, distance yourself from her (if possible) and let her get caught for her poor work ethnic, don‚Äôt do anything else."
532,"You‚Äôve given here a chance. Obviously it hurts to do something you know will cause harm to another black person, but if she‚Äôs determined to succeed, she need this slap in the face and she will learn from this."
533,"Snitch if you think he'll listen to you. She's creating a poor work environment. You spend 40 hrs a week there, you don't need that."
534,"Probably an unpopular opinion but I wouldn't try to get her fired. I understand that she isn't the most hard working employee but at this time with many companies closed and the economy going in the direction it's going, I wouldn't want to see another black woman out of work."
535,"Yeah. And at this point I'm fed up. I was ok with doing more work to help her out until she got acclimated. But once she told my manager that the [BM] on our team was coming in late, and he use to give her rides to work bc she didnt have a car. It was the last straw for me. He's a single father of two and our company allows for that stipulation for families. 

It is a race issue for me bc it is so much harder for people of color to penetrate corporate environment."
536,"Yeah. She has tried. Each time she did it backfired. She told my manager that shes not being trained well, my manager said you cant get it maybe youre not the right person for the job..."
537,"Not really. She doesnt bring any skillsets that would make her an asset. Once she came on board. I offered to train her from the ground up. And I did 3x over. All she needed was a college degree in any discipline, which she had. She just have a very poor work ethic and interpersonal skills."
538,That's so true thank you. It looks like she's trying to shapen up within the past 2 to 3 days... after she burned every bridge. But she really doesn't know how to do her job now.
539,"And that's where I'm struggling. Tbh if she were white, I would have let her go a while back without remorse."
540,It's hard but at the end of the day you have to come in knowing you have to be great. She clearly doesn't get that. You tried to put her on but some people just not gonna make it. I worked with a bunch of women like her. I try to give you game but if you ain't got the skill you gotta get off the field.
541,"‚úÇÔ∏è‚úÇÔ∏è‚úÇÔ∏è

You probably dont actively need to get her fired but removing the cancer from the workplace is a good thing. 

I personally would bc it could turn in to a her or you situation. Could get ugly."
542,Just curious - what is her degree in?
543,"At this point I would live it up to the manager. It might be too late for her, especially if she's she burned all her bridges. Maybe have a talk with all three of you all. Give her two weeks if possible, if no progress then she'll have to get fired. If any of this is possible of course."
544,"I think you‚Äôve already gone way above and beyond for her. 

She doesn‚Äôt sound like a good fit. And she might find her real happiness because of this loss. 

But wait til the pandemic passes. No one is hiring right now."
545,"Maybe give her warning and if she doesn't improve after the warning, consider letting her go?"
546,"Hers is in business. But typically we look for engineers or graphic designers. Because the field is specialized we usually train from the ground up. The other 3 black females have their degrees in Education, Mechanical Engineering, and an Associate in Business. And they are phenomenal."
547,"I've warned her about her work ethic and she just got sneakier. I think she truly is shaping up now, because she seems afraid for her job."
548,"I know you want to save her and you know you can't. You are struggling why? If you have already stated that if was someone else they would have been gone. You know what you have to do. Everyone and the universe is telling you this. If you can't list 3 - 5 five ways she adds value to her role, it time to talk with leadership and HR because this has high percentage of being messy. All you can do is prepare."
549,"That is true. And I agree with everyone on here. I started falling behind on my work, and I'm putting in 45 to 50 hours a week to catch up after supporting her. And she makes more excuses. I cant think of a single thing she brings to the table. I'm worried about it being messy because I hate giving off the impression that ""black folks cant get along."" Especially at my workplace, white folks have a tendency to measure us all against the weakest among us. I've worked hard to counteract that and I wanted this resolved quietly, but I dont think that will be the case. Thank you so much for your answer.

But is there anyway I can try to resolve it before going to my manager?"
550,"It sounds like you are a really good leader. You do well assessing situations and yourself. You're accountable and knowledgeable. Trust yourself. This isn't about perpetuating stereotypes. Some black folks get along with other black folks and some don't. It is ludicrous to think that we should all get along just because we have similar skin shades. The woman is creating a toxic work environment. It's not the black woman, just a woman. Do what you need to do. You got this.

  


Sounds like to me you've done all you can do. You don't have to involve your manager.I've had experiences where a manager takes action on someone and the someone comes directly to me to dispute it.  I always feel some kind of way when a direct report leaves me out of the loop on situations like this.  If I was your manager I would want to support you anyway I could."
551,either he's stupid or manipulative or both.
552,"A lot of people aren‚Äôt taking it serious. Stick to your guns and your intuition. Better safe than sorry. My friends are behaving that way since I‚Äôm ‚Äúyoung and healthy‚Äù but I would rather not risk my life or the life of others. I hope you can make your partner understand this. 

Luckily for me, I live with my best friend so this quarantine isn‚Äôt to bad. If possible, if he has been quarantining himself to your satisfaction, y‚Äôall could quarantine together but if he is throwing caution to the wind then I wouldn‚Äôt. I would also consider this a learning experience and decide whether or not this is the type of behavior you will be able to put up with long term. My line sisters on the other hand would like for me to see them but I cannot risk my health and the health of those who I come into contact with."

554,[deleted]
555,"Anyone who is constantly guilting you after you've set a boundary is disrespecting your boundaries. Doesn't matter what it is. Plus, to not be taking this seriously right now, not only is that stupid on his own part, but he's okay with possibly getting it and passing it onto others.  Everyone is capable of getting it, no one is immune, so him acting like you won't get it because you're not old is ignorant af. He needs to respect your boundaries **and** your health right now. I keep telling people, it's not like we live in 1812, you have phones, Skype, facetime, snapchat, etc.; you are not as alone as you think you are and you can still keep in touch with everyone, yet people are acting like they're stuck in their house with literally no connection to anyone. It's ridiculous. Right now, health is more important than traveling to have sex with your partner (because that's what it sounds like he's really getting at). Better learn how to sext or do some phone/video sex right now or something, lol."
556,"Trust your gut. People young and old are going to the hospital after getting this virus, so the fact that you‚Äôre 29 is moot. I am in a similar situation. I haven‚Äôt seen my bf in almost 2 weeks. He didn‚Äôt like it, but he understands it‚Äôs way too risky. He still has to go to work everyday and deal with people whose hygiene I don‚Äôt trust. It‚Äôs also doubtful that your bf is going to remain 6ft from you the entire time you‚Äôre at his place. 

We Skype a few times a day and try to play games. It sucks, but it‚Äôs necessary right now. We are only supposed to be going where we HAVE TO go... work, home, grocery. The sooner everyone realizes this, maybe the sooner we can get back to normal."
557,So if he's going to keep you within 6 feet at all times then he can honestly just video chat with you from where you currently are. This virus is absolutely not worth catching to be with him. People of all ages are dying and in hospitals. You are not being too distant.
558,"This quarantine shit isn't optional. Thousands of people are dying because people initially didnt take it seriously. Old, young, middle age, healthy, unhealthy, etc. 

Not only is he giving me bad vibes by guilt tripping you, it also gives me bad vibes that he doesn't care about your health or others at the expense of himself. Even if you dont get it, you can be a vector for someone else to get it, someone much more vulnerable. If medical professionals can isolate themselves from their spouses and kids for the sake of public health, he can suck it up and facetime you instead. Stick to your guns."
559,"This is interesting to read.

Over on r/relationship_advice, a girl dumped her bf for this reason and a guy in the comments dumped his gf for this reason,.."
560,"This is about sex, so tell him to use his hand and grow up. He‚Äôs not going to stay 6ft away from you if you go over there. You‚Äôre not dumb. 

But on the off chance he‚Äôs being sincere, no reason why you can‚Äôt just FaceTime for hours at a time.

He‚Äôs being manipulative and trying to play with your health as a result. 

My sister is an ER physician, this is getting back and will get so much worse before it even begins getting better. Please stick to your guns."
561,"I can't see my boyfriend, and the only place I go is work because I am considered essential. We miss each other tons and we call and text each other, but there's no way either of us are willing to put the other in danger.

He's being manipulative and inconsiderate for your wellbeing, his own, and the wellbeing of others. Don't doubt yourself, he's being an AH."
562,"One thing this pandemic has revealed is how people truly respond under pressure.

Your bf sounds like my co-workers who are upset at having to mostly work from home starting tomorrow. They seem to believe a minor inconvenience is worse than risking our lives unnecessarily. It's not and it's more ridiculous considering they're over 60. A check will do nothing if you're dead.

My bf and I haven't seen each other in over 1 month. His workplace was one of the first sites of multiple cases in our state. The entire office immediately went into quarantine.  He never once mentioned us meeting up. He was more concerned about my well-being since I was still going in. If anything that reaffirms that our bond is going to survive this. Unfortunately tomorrow I will start having to worry for him as his office considers him essential and he has to start going back in.

Tell your bf that you're not going to break quarantine to satisfy his desire. If he doesn't like it, it's time to go. Doing what's right is worth more than his pleasure."
563,"He‚Äôs being downright stupid and ignorant. My aunt was diagnosed with the virus and seeing how difficult it was for her, I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt go anywhere near him especially with how reckless he‚Äôs being. Thankfully she‚Äôs one of the few people who have recovered from it completely."
564,"Your employer may very well have guidelines about discretionary travel. I have a part time job (LTC) on top of my main job and my main job informed me not to work at my part time job or I‚Äôd have to quarantine myself for 14 days (same went for travel to infected areas/exposure to infected people). I‚Äôm a healthcare provider.

I know you‚Äôre only an hour away but it may be the case that your employer strongly discourages that.

Other than that, your SO needs to take this seriously. This will get worse before it gets better. And if your SO can‚Äôt understand that, explain that you don‚Äôt want to be responsible for getting an immunocompromised and/or elderly person sick (even though you may be asymptomatic). If they still don‚Äôt understand, don‚Äôt give in and inform them you‚Äôll need to have a conversation about boundaries and your ‚Äòno‚Äô meaning ‚Äòno‚Äô."
565,"Say no.  

My parents have been very open about family medical history. There‚Äôs stuff I don‚Äôt remember. I was shocked to find out wheat has always been an issue for me. Do you know for certain that you don‚Äôt have a diagnosed vulnerability? You might not know.  Don‚Äôt risk it."
566,"My boyfriend asked me to come to his house (12 hour drive/2 hour flight) since my school is now remote and he is working from home. He made it very clear that I didn‚Äôt have to do it if I weren‚Äôt comfortable. 

My point is, he shouldn‚Äôt have to downplay the numbers or continue to ask you when you already told you that you weren‚Äôt comfortable. These aren‚Äôt good signs. Just trust your gut."
567,My cousins friend died of covid and she was your age with no underlying symptoms. No one is immune to this virus.
568,"That he‚Äôs guilt tripping you and whining is the red flag here, and something you should seriously evaluate going forward.

As to the virus, your odds of getting it driving to your BF is the same as any two couple household, assuming he isn‚Äôt working or living in a highly contagious environment. I know I wouldn‚Äôt personally worry about that, but ymmv."
569,"Sorry, but he's not a great guy AT ALL, if he's got you second guessing yourself/making you feel guilty.

I'm a guy too. I love sex too. I love spending time together too if I'm in a relationship. But he needs to grow up and not try to use you as a masturbation device. 

People are literally dying, and y'all in the US are about to face some though times it seems. Look at what's happening in Italy... they have no room for their dead. They're loading them on military trucks, and families can't say goodbye. 

please remain as ""paranoid"" as you need to, in order for you to feel safe."
570,"Yeah, younger people can and have gotten the virus before. Several have died from it. Even setting that aside, if you survive it's still a very slow and painful process to recovery, not to mention that a lot of hospitals are placed in extremely difficult situations. If that weren't enough, you also risk infecting others.

The lockdown has taken its mental toll for sure, but that is no reason at all to ignore  quarantine protocol. It's for all of our good. He really shouldn't be going out unless he is working and still has to physically report to work, groceries are needed, or it's something urgent.

It's a literal quarantine, he'll live. Better yet, he really should not be guilting you as it's not like you're ignoring or distancing him when you have a perfectly understandable and necessary reason for keeping a physical distance. If you're both still physically going to work then you're both at higher risk too--that's dismissive af of him."
571,Tell him that he‚Äôs putting his entire family‚Äôs health at risk for being a dumbass. This virus is killing younger people too. It‚Äôs nothing to okay with.
572,You shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty for basically trying to protect yourself. He‚Äôs wanting you to risk your health so you can see him? How old is he??? Time for a new bf since he wants to make you risk your health.
573,That's manipulation and it isn't okay. The fact that he is doing this makes it clear he is willing to jeopardize your health for his entertainment.  A 16 year old with no underlying health conditions just died this thing isn't a joke.
574,"You're doing everything perfectly. He's being manipulative.

My bf and I live apart, but in the same town. We haven't seen each other for going on 2 weeks now (I've been completely isolating, he couldn't until recently because of his job, which ended up getting him sick since he's customer-facing). It hurts, and it sucks, but at no point have either of us tried to convince the other to break quarantine because we want to keep each other safe.

Tell him to stop. You'll see each other again. FaceTime, call each other on the phone, play video games together. If he's not okay with keeping his distance and finding other ways to be together to keep yourself and himself safe, that's not okay."
575,He should be coming to you... not the other way around.  If your bf wants to see you so badly he knows where you live.
576,"Break up with him, sis. He doesn‚Äôt care about your safety nor your feelings about the situation. He‚Äôs a manipulative little brat. Stay home and flirt online with a man that will gladly wait for this to be over."
577,"Me personally, I would still see my bf. We still do, not everyday but we try weekly if we can. I‚Äôm essential staff and so is he. The other day we took a walk in the park since that is still allowed in our city. I‚Äôve had to sacrifice a lot of things because of this virus and I‚Äôm not going to let it take me away from my love too. For us is not even about sex, it‚Äôs finding comfort and decompressing with each other during this difficult time especially since we both still are working too. 

But I also had to get clearance from my job to make sure seeing him was alright. My job has numerous tips and resources that we follow to prevent spread when we get home or when he comes over here or if I go over there. We both follow them. 

Are you worried he‚Äôs still going out, like being around others and not just staying at home?"
578,Yeah he sucks but honestly if you don't really want to be within 6ft of him why are you dating him at all?
579,"Both, I'd say."
580,"Thank you so much for your advice. He‚Äôs been going out and even went out of town to visit his parents.  It just feels like he‚Äôs being selfish. 

Stay healthy."
581,"Just about to say, he‚Äôs obviously trying to pressure her to come over for sex. Don‚Äôt fall for it op."
582,"You are dead on. I feel like I can‚Äôt trust him to think about the big picture. At this point, I associate going out right now as borderline risky behavior. We‚Äôve been asked to do something so small that can save lives and I don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs so difficult. 

Thank you, sis."
583,"He says it‚Äôs not enough and I need to be with him. Honestly, I feel like any contact is rewarding him for this foolishness and he‚Äôs not acting trustworthy right now. 

I‚Äôm going to give him another boundary talk and if he keeps hounding me, it‚Äôs over. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt put it past him to show up and that‚Äôs what has me worried."
584,"Thanks for sharing. My bf promised to keep me WITHIN 6 ft, so he has no intention of keeping a distance between us. 

I‚Äôm glad you have someone who is understanding and respects your health. 

Stay safe!"
585,"You got him: he doesn‚Äôt care about my health. He‚Äôs acting like everything he‚Äôs saying is out of love for me because he misses me so much, but I swear it reads as the exact opposite. 

This sub is really something to cherish. Thank you, sis."
586,"This is really a testament of how much your partner respects you and if they can see the big picture. He‚Äôs so focused on instant gratification, that he can‚Äôt see that he‚Äôs putting his gf‚Äôs health on the line.  He really thinks it‚Äôs impossible to get it because ‚Äúthe odds are low‚Äù. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he started showing up, which scares me honestly. 

I trust this sub more than r/relationshipadvice. People be telling you 50 million ways to get screwed over on that sub. Be safe!"
587,"That‚Äôs the thing, he promised to keep me WITHIN 6ft, like this is a joke or something. I told another user that he‚Äôs hounding me so much, that I think he‚Äôs going to show up at my place. He‚Äôs acting so relentless and nearsighted that I‚Äôm willing to call it quits."
588,"You and your bf are right on so many levels; it‚Äôs about the wellbeing of your loved ones, your community, and most importantly yourself! He‚Äôs pestering me and I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him to show up at my place. It‚Äôs definitely giving me anxiety. 

I hope your bf‚Äôs workplace takes extra precautions to keep him safe! Stay healthy and I appreciate your advice so much."
589,Wow. I‚Äôm glad she recovered. I think of him as acting reckless too. Be safe.
590,"I‚Äôll give him the boundary talk and if he doesn‚Äôt respect it (which I suspect he might not), then it‚Äôs definitely over. 

Never thought about work and it actually might be possible that they‚Äôve implemented a travel ordinance."
591,"That‚Äôs the thing! Why even take the chance. I‚Äôm baffled at how aggressive he‚Äôs being over this and it‚Äôs so off-putting.  

If there are so many people quarantining themselves, there has to be for a reason. They‚Äôre responsible! Be safe!"
592,"Thank you u/TeamSatan69 (lol). Seriously, thank you for the advice. He‚Äôs really laying it on thick and it‚Äôs painfully obvious what his intentions are if I go to his place. I never would‚Äôve thought he‚Äôd pressure me like this or make me feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong. I laid down the law this morning and he hasn‚Äôt responded so far."
593,"Thank you for sharing how you‚Äôre handling this. 

I know my bf still going out. He went out of town recently to visit his family. Plus he‚Äôs not even acknowledging the severity of the situation."
594,"Because there‚Äôs a pandemic in the area and people are dying of complications from getting the virus. He‚Äôs been out and traveling, so I‚Äôd rather not be in close proximity with someone who might have been exposed. Before all this happened we definitely spent plenty of one on one time together"
595,And childish/immature
596,Straight reckless
597,Gross. And you know that man is not going to stay 6 ft away from you. Please trust your gut.
598,You should never have two boundary talks.
599,"Yeah, try to communicate with him again. Shoot, even if there was no pandemic going on and you just didn't want to see him for some reason, would he be acting like this? Be clear and let him know that you're serious about this and you're not budging. If he can't understand and respect your boundaries, because that's what is at the base of this all, then yeah, you need to definitely re-evaluate this relationship."
600,"I think a number of commenters (myself included) assumed that you'd written that he said he'd stay 6ft _away_ from you, not keep you _within_ 6ft. I think we all wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was at least _pretending_ to do the right thing.

We literally can't even give him the benefit of the doubt! His intentions are clear. Save yourself, even if won't."
601,"I wasn‚Äôt able to go see her but FaceTime kept us closer. She‚Äôs doing good and hope it stays like that. Let‚Äôs hope he‚Äôll come to his senses. I have said to some of my friends that only the strong couples will come out of this stronger. Everyone else is going to fight tooth and nail to keep the relationship going. I‚Äôm terrified of the divorce rates that we are going to see once this blows away. 

All the best."
602,"You're more than welcome. 

Save yourself, take care of yourself. No one is gonna do it for you, if you worry more about someone's wellbeing  than your own. Being empathic and caring can be tricky business, and immature people pick up on that very easily, and will manipulate you.

And what is hard to believe, is that they'll excuse that behavior by figuring if you're not smart enough to see the manipulation, it's okay for them to do so. Because if they don't do it, someone else will. And then that other person will benefit off of using you. And they're too self-involved to have your best interests at heart, so they'll happily have you fulfil their needs.

And yes, it's totally fullfiling to take care of someone you love. But it stops being fun if the other doesn't give back equally.


Just like children who can't empathise, all they feel is their own pressing needs. (though for kids it's normal to an extent ofcourse, which is when you indeed lay down the law. Your not his mom, teacher, or guardian though)."
603,"Okay, yeah I wouldn‚Äôt see him then. It‚Äôs definitely serious out here, but if he‚Äôs not taking necessary precautions/ or taking it seriously then I wouldn‚Äôt put myself at risk."
604,"I'm not suggesting you NEED to see him. It sounds like not only does he not respect your boundaries, but you don't really seem to like him all that much, so why not just break up?"
605,Divorce rates and pregnancy rates are definitely going to rise after this.
606,I'm envious of how clean and nicely styled these places are. I need to step my game up!
607,"Akala said it all. We're only represented when there's ""Black on Black"" crime."
608,I really want to focus on buying a home now. Step 1 is very intimidating but I'm excited.
609,Thank you for searching for and posting these! A great source of inspo for many.
610,This is riiiight up my street so thank you!
611,yay love this!
612,I luv your title. So excellent.
613,"Which in itself sets the agenda very clearly as every race is known to harm it's own the most on a day to day basis - crime is about opportunity, emotion and proximity and most are around others like themselves day in day out. East Asians have the Triad, South Asians and Arabs have honour killings frequently perpetuated against close relatives and even children as well as warfare (look at Yemen and Saudi Arabia and Pakistan vs. India), White people have sexual assaults, abuse, sports hooliganism and murders etc. - all perpetuated against their own daily.

You never hear those referred to as 'Asian on Asian', 'Arab on Arab', or 'White on White' in any capacity. There has only been a term coined for that concept in regard to our community, to give the impression somehow we have very little ties that bind us."
614,I see what you did there!
615,Thanks!
616,Haha! My attempt at being funny wasn‚Äôt in vain!

# Looking for a strong/open minded/fun/dynamic sister to create a podcast about African women experience from the motherland to the diaspora

&#x200B;

Hello, I have always dreamed of sharing my experience and my journey about what a Sub-Saharan African woman has to go through (Lies, family drama, secrets, pain, struggles, triumph, aspiration, resilience, deception, betrayal, sexuality, sexual abuse, motherhood, survival..) with others, I would like to have a co-host or two and see if we can talk about very deep but also fun subjects. I know that African culture is about unspoken and secret world but I also know that we need to break the vicious cycle and have a legacy on our own. Please if seriously interested, reach out. I am a mother, a wife, a daughter, a service member, a federal government employee, a humanitarian, an activist, a dreamer and most importantly a fun spirit. Thank you"
618,"When this happens, I want to be one of the first listeners. There‚Äôs a lot to unpack!!"
619,This is awesome! I‚Äôm wanna listen too.
620,I know someone that has a show called Motherless Daughter maybe she could help you.She‚Äôs from Africa and I interview her on my podcast.
621,This sounds great.  Please let us know when this launches.  I will be one of your first listeners.
622,I thank you!
623,You're very welcome!

625,"I hope they have a second season!! I haven't laughed out loud over a show in so long!!!

What was your favorite sketch or character?"
626,Angela Bassett is truly da baddest of them all
627,"üòÇüòÇüòÇOh you want breathe, Huh?
LMAO. So true. So true."
628,r/ABlackLadySketchShow was the BEST show of 2019
629,The fashion nova clipboard at the end always kills me lmao
630,"""She's already at All-Star Weekend levels!"" LMFAOOO"
631,Angela Bassett- the true queen!!!üåπüå∫
632,"Much as I loved this, we also not about to sit here and act like they lied -- being a bad bitch is hard af üòìü§£"
633,"""Oh this hoe tryna take deep breaths?"" Lmaooo"
634,"Maybe she was a bad bitch with alopecia? No, she was an ok bitch- I could tell by her wedges. ü§£ü§£ü§£"
635,Yo what the fuck. How long has this existed? I really gotta start paying more attention to humor and positivity.
636,I‚Äôve never even heard of fashion nova lol
637,why have I never seen this? I'm watching a bunch now. The no make up one is amazing
638,"The her-tep always takes me out lmfao it‚Äôs so accurate, I also loved the cutscene comparing each other‚Äôs hair and sleep routine ."
639,Hertep and the no makeup sketch are my favorites lol. The show was hilarious.
640,THIS. And the gang orientation!!!!!! They thought she was playing with her expectations.
641,"For me the 227 sketch was my fav! Loved seeing that show getting some recognition and they brought out a few of the original actors too, including Marla Gibbs (legend) :-)"
642,My favorite sketch was black lady courtroom!üëèüèæüëèüèæ
643,"Breathe when you die honey, okay?"
644,"OMG how did I miss that the first 8 times I watched this sketch?! Oh well, guess it‚Äôs time to watch it again lol"
645,That line killed me ! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
646,"No make up gets me everytime!! ""Ya dont need NARS with skin like ours"""
647,"Me too!  I love 227 and everytime I see a reference to it, I get really excited and no one around ever remembers it :("
648,Lmao
649,I tell ya lol Only the oldheads at my job remember it. Such a great show!!!
650,"I don‚Äôt get it... I read it and it just seems like she‚Äôs insecure that having long nails may make some see her as ‚Äúghetto‚Äù so she‚Äôs written an article about how she loves them and how in her mind her race and her acrylic nails tie together. Long, Cardi B nails are not considered professional, but her dark purple nails look like a million other women‚Äôs. What‚Äôs the relation? I feel like some people are so deeply insecure that they really see race in everything because they don‚Äôt make a single move without worrying about what others might say/think. Nobody gives a shit about our fucking nails. A white girl with excessively long nails is considered tacky too. This is a classism thing, they‚Äôre associated with poorer areas where I always assumed the women want ‚Äúloud‚Äù nails to make a point to others that they could afford to get them done."
651,It is most definitely racial. Classism intertwines too. But if you don‚Äôt get it or believe it that‚Äôs a personal problem and your right to interpret
652,"You're right, it's racial.

Up until recently, long nails were considered a black and ""ghetto"" and ""low class"" thing. Now that white girls are copying these nails, they're seen as less of a ""ghetto"" thing. BUT only when they wear them.

I feel like at most, the nails are seen as ""unprofessional"" and a little trashy when white girls do them. But let a black girl wear these long nail ( like we been doing since forever!). All of sudden we're ghetto , trashy, loud, etc

People love to go ""dont insert race into every thing"". We dont have to lol....almost everything has something racial at its foundation! Things like these nails were not created / exist in a vacuum. Race is intertwined with A LOT of stuff in this world. Dont know why people are trying to ignore it.

Also I find it weird that these nails are called ""cardi b"" nails now. When she's been anti-black a multiple times ( especially towards darker skinned black women) and only claims blackness when convenient."
653,Bloop bloop
654,LMFAO
655,I‚Äôve big chopped twice now. To prepare I didn‚Äôt really do anything lol but growing out moisture is key and I do weekly scalp massages with Jamaican black castor oil.
656,How young we talking?
657,How about ages 13-25
658,Perfect yeah. I‚Äôll put that in the rules/description
659,I was thinking 13-30 range but don‚Äôt feel excluded of you‚Äôre out of that range
660,Yea that‚Äôs better I think
661,13-30 is too big. If you‚Äôre talking young you should do 13-18.
662,13 - 30? That's a wide range.
663,I think 13-18. 18-25 there is a HUGE difference is growth
664,Hmm maybe yea
665,Yea maybe it should be 13-18. I might reconsider
666,Holy fuck those earrings. Where did you get them and are they delivering??
667,"I did a double take like ""Oh they cute- oh hey wait I know her!"" Long time no talk to. You look great! I love the wrap."

708,"Also: What about people on Social Security?
People on Social Security are eligible to receive the coronavirus relief payment as long as their total income does not exceed the limit. Low-income Americans on Social Security do not need to file a tax return. As long as they received an SSA-1099 form (the Social Security benefit statement), the federal government will be able to send them a payment via the usual way they get their Social Security payment. Retirees and people on disability are both eligible for the special payment.

Are the checks taxable? No, they are not taxable."

Are those crochet braids?"
749,Thanks!
750,"lol that‚Äôs so funny, my friends have been begging me to wear makeup for years & and I‚Äôve watched them do theirs and finally did it myself. That‚Äôs a huge compliment because I really didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd do well. Thank you!!!"
751,Thank you!
752,Forever21! Thank you
753,"Me, too! Those are such lovely curls."
754,Thank you! And its Fenty matte foundation. And then a little bit of highlight from True Complexion Contour (medium to dark) from Target. I applied everything very lightly cuz it was my first time and I didn‚Äôt wanna overdo it and get that cakey look. And then lashes with eyeliner.
755,Yep
756,You‚Äôre welcome!
757,Thank you! I‚Äôm really into makeup so I always like to know what other people use lol.
758,Cute!
759,"Second week of my new job is almost over, and even though they've been mad supportive, I'm still finding things to stress over. It's crazy how an abusive environment can get deep into your head and keep harming you even after you leave it. But I'm doing my best to heal from it and leave it behind, and move forward with confidence in this new place. 

I've been doing a simple makeup look every day, and I think it's really been boosting my mood. Just some eye shadow, eye liner, blush, and lip color. If I can actually start getting up when I intend to, I might be able to get some concealer and/or tinted moisturizer going. Then y'all better watch out, because this bitch will be looking *flawless* lol!

Also, my super-badass prescription sunglasses came in! I posted a selfie on Facebook with me wearing them, and so many people came out of the woodwork to tell me how good they look, it was a really nice start to my day!

Edit: I realize I forgot to say what my plans are for the weekend. I'm takin' them sunglasses out to soak up some of this 80-degree and sunny weather, because I've been way too cooped up with this stupid pandemic. We're still allowed to go to the park, I think, so I'm going."
760,"Week 3 of WFH is in the books. April 5 will make it a month. Week 3 has been the absolute best. Idk if it's because everyone is home now but there is so much extra love and affirmation in my life this week. 
1 old friend reached out & we hashed some old shit out. My old high school bestie & I got back in touch (& I think she's fam). I made a few new lady friends, too. 

It's funny because one asked me to add her on The Pattern, read what it says about us as friends & in relationship and then we'll discuss. We talked on the phone for the first time last night & I think I understand why The Pattern thinks we would work as friends & in a relationship. She also has one of the sweetest voices I have ever heard. But I'm honestly not seeing any of these Quarantine Baes as anything too serious. I think most will ghost as soon as the vaccine is approved.

Today, I need to focus on my performance review. I'm pretty sure I'm getting promoted, especially once the VP finds out I was chosen by my colleagues to be Co-Chair of our Black employee ERG (social group). She lives for shit like that, plus I'll get to collab with our LGBT group & women's group (she executive sponsors it).

Edit: to clarify - the Black employees in the company chose me for the role. Not my work team.üëçüèΩ"

779,"I dont know how old you are, but for me the only thing that helped was time. I had a big growth spurt at 13/14 and got a bunch of stretch marks on my hips. They didn‚Äôt fade away until I was 17ish? I‚Äôm 19 now and they‚Äôre completely gone with no products or anything. 

I think a lot of it is genetics though. Like my mom has been 250 pounds and back (she‚Äôs like 5‚Äô10 and 140 now) and has had kids and she doesn‚Äôt have anything close to stretch marks, where others get them solely from puberty."
780,"As far as I know, the remedy is time.  As frustrating as it is.  Most of my childhood scars have gone away, I do have some puberty/weight gain stretch marks that are more or less gone.  That is, I live with them and am aware of them, but some stranger is probably not going to notice them without getting too personal.

I've only tried scar cream for my newer scars, but I have heard good things about tanning and Bio Oil to make scars/stretch marks less noticeable."
781,"You can‚Äôt get rid of stretch marks only improve their appearance, bio oil and all those other creams do not work, they may remedy in them FADING only slightly but ultimately do not get rid of them. You can try more expensive treatments but it‚Äôs not guaranteed to work and will only fade them. Stretch marks fade into this silver color over time which doesn‚Äôt look bad, but I mean it still isn‚Äôt ideal if you‚Äôre looking to get rid of them. It sucks, I know, BUT honestly they aren‚Äôt all that bad, I honesty forget about them until I see myself in the mirror. 

Sincerely, a person who has DONE everything including expensive treatments to get rid of them and finally learned to just leave them alone or cover them with makeup."

790,I love history. I love imagining our historical figures beyond what they give us in the history books.

792,One thing I appreciate is how she lets everyone know that that's her shit. Husband included. Their relationship is the most interesting to me and makes me appreciate how Oprah is with Steadmon that much more.
793,"Yes!! Her ambition and vision comes first. A marriage ought to be lifting one another up and supporting their dreams.

794,"That's the thing tho. Ego.  His dad tried hard to put him on.  When he told him, ""what you feeling right now, the regret won't be worth it."" That shit was so real. I knew that ring wasn't going to work. It's never the money. It's always principal. I am a woman with the business mind. We are really wired different."
795,"You've got that right. Petty ego can't get in the way of true talent and ambition, no matter how you slice it. A black woman with ambition is a dangerous thing."

820,"Here‚Äôs a way to think about the price of a wig and whether or not it‚Äôs a good price:
- women typically buy 3 bundles of hair. Those bundles are typically at least $100, usually under $150 apiece. I‚Äôve never purchased a bundle of hair that was more than that. So let‚Äôs just assume each bundle is $120. $120x3 gets you to a total of $360 for 3 bundles. Now let‚Äôs assume you plan to get the weave installed by someone. That‚Äôs also at least $100. That gets you to $460. 
- For $460 you could easily find a decent wig already made and ready to go and you can wear it over and over again. I like to mention the bundle price breakdown because I often hear women claim wigs are too expensive, yet when you do the math they‚Äôre actually a much better investment than getting install after install. 
- unless you really just prefer the way a weave looks or you want some leave out(u part wigs are currently hard to find), then I‚Äôd say a wig is a better bang for your buck. 
- there are also women who claim they‚Äôd rather make their own and save money but imo unless you know what you‚Äôre doing you may end up wasting a lot of your time as well as wasting money buying all the materials only to mess something up. I‚Äôd rather buy one already made or custom made by someone who knows what they‚Äôre doing."
821,Shiid check yo finances - I‚Äôd take whoever gives me a scholarship &  join the black student union. Don‚Äôt go into debt over education unless you absolutely have to
822,"Do what's best for you financially. Even though Howard may be the better choice UT Austin may not be bad either. You can use that to your advantage. Talk to professors and students in both departments of each school to find out which might be better. If everything fits with Howard then choose that, just know that you'll have loans. UT Austin might be better and you'll probably experience racism and microaggression. We're black, that'll happen no matter where you go you can't escape that. If Howard had a grad school consider that. Look over the majors at each school as well as internships and working on campus."
823,"I have honestly never known anyone who has regretted going to Howard. However...plenty regret their student loans. I can't advocate going into $100k+ debt for undergrad. Although, ""parents will pay for both"" sounds like you have things covered? Tough choice, I just suggest figuring out the financial situation first. Then consider if you prefer to be more comfortable (familiar place/close to home/heavy sports environment) or if you want a little more adventure (far away/financial instability/surrounded by beautiful black academics). Both are more than valid, good luck!"
824,Go to Howard. More nurturing and less hostile student body
825,"Since you can‚Äôt visit Howard to get that ‚Äúdoes this feel like home‚Äù feeling, I think you should first see which one is a better option financially for you. Going to a HBCU is a life changing experience (I didn‚Äôt go to one but many of my friends did and always speak highly of them) and if your finances allow you to do so with no debt or very minimal debt (I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt want to come out of school with 100k in debt) then choose based off that. Also, there‚Äôs plenty of other HBCU‚Äôs you  could look into they may have these majors and cost less, you could look into that too. A lot of HBCU‚Äôs hold weight simply because they are HBCU‚Äôs. 

Now, I am from Texas and UT is a great school as well but Austin isn‚Äôt so diverse and that 4% Black student population  could be a, well a blessing and a curse. The blessing is if the BSU at UT and the other Black Organizations are tight knit. This is usually where your fun college memories come from in the beginning. Student organization and if your roommate is cool, random ass adventures you both will take. This is until you make your own friends (hopefully through the Black Organizations/other orgs and in your classes) If the BSU and other organizations aren‚Äôt very tight knit, you may wish you went to a HBCU, BUT all hope isn‚Äôt lost because you can and there‚Äôs a high possibility that you will meet your circle of friends that resemble you. 

All in all, if you can, find some ways to talk to people from both universities. See what student life is like (before this whole madness) see if you can speak to people that were in the BSU‚Äôs and students who weren‚Äôt. This will give you a general idea about student life atleast."
826,"Honestly you can't go wrong with either choice. Both are fantastic institutions. I have friends who went to both and absolutely loved their decisions. Consider how much debt you would go in and also what region of the United States you'd like to work in after graduation. UT holds more weight in the South. I think Howard holds more educational weight on a national scale. You might also find more opportunities in your desired major simply because you went to Howard. Some employers seek out Howard grads or have pipeline programs specific to Howard or other HBCUs.

Another pro about UT is the black community is small and close-knit."
827,"I agree. Try your best to minimize your debt, because it *can take a long time* to pay off student loans. I went to two schools with small black populations and I still found my circle of friends."
828,^ This. Even a 20k difference could be your future down payment.
829,"Yep. Agreed. Also, it‚Äôs super likely you‚Äôll go to grad school. You can go to PWI for grad school. I went to an HBCU (Spelman) for undergrad and a PWI law school. The best decision I‚Äôve ever made (not the PWI part, the HBCU lol)"

On Netflix, I finished Gentefied, and am very very slowly watching Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Diableros, and Dear White People

I‚Äôll probably start Queen Sono. I take things slow because I‚Äôm not a big tv person, and prefer movies, but I love spy shit so I‚Äôll probably dive in,

836,I‚Äôm binge watching Kim possible on Disney plus. I‚Äôm getting back on Netflix soon. I just can‚Äôt afford so many streaming services
837,"Finally finished the latest season of Dear White People. 

Fell in love with Kim's Convenience - super easy to watch show if you need something mindless.

Currently watching Schitt's Creek and I'm OBSESSED. I'm slowly savoring it, just finished the first season.

Also just started Tiger King, like every one else lol"
838,"I binged 13 Reasons Why. It was awful, but a fun watch.  
New Girl, although I can only stomach maybe three episodes at a time. The Jess character is too perky for me. 
Schitt‚Äôs Creek is hilarious"
839,How was tiger king?
840,How does it generally compare to the US version? Don't know if I should start it.
841,I love trashy horror as well
842,Intense as hell. I had to pause and rewind so many time because I just didn't believe what I heard the first time. And I had on subtitles. Finished it in a day tho.
843,"I actually liked it more than the US version. It was fun, made Brazilian culture look so cool and had more people to root for. It's also partly because watching it in another language made me feel less awkward about how they talked to each other in chat."
844,"I highly recommend Tubi then. Probably the biggest repository for trashy horror outside of Shudder and you don‚Äôt even need an account to watch.

There‚Äôs commercials, but I‚Äôve found them to be fairly unobtrusive."
845,Foundation tho!!!! Flawless n u cray lol love it

847,It's gonna be in the 80s here this week and this is #mood.
848,Ohhh my gooood üíñüíò‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
849,THANK YOUüíï
850,I love that vibe
851,Danke üíï
852,I am only on episode 2 ... It's funny.
853,i watched up to episode 3. i thought it was decent. i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a show that should be taken seriously though(i didn‚Äôt). episode 3 was really weird
854,I‚Äôve really enjoyed it. It‚Äôs funny and pretty real and I think it does a good job of giving the black characters their own voices.
855,I thought episode 5 was truly beautiful. I don't want to say too much more without spoilers but I loved it. Been a fan of his music for a few years now and I think the show is funny but I have a corny sense of humor
856,"You not being dramatic. I never watched any of these shows. Just based off the posters and ""ish"" part of the titles I knew they wouldn't be for me."
857,"just watched the trailer and I'll pass lol. I understand the style he's going for (fake reality show/documentary-style) but I didn't laugh once while watching the trailer, but maybe because I'm so tired of these stories about ""black people navigating in a white world."" I feel like the shows he makes serve to explain to non-black people what the black experience (or his, specifically) is, so when I'm watching them it just feels like I'm getting a Black Person 101 lesson and getting beat over the head with flat jokes about how black people are /this way/ and other people just wouldn't understand. Plus, all the jokes about how ""whitewashed"" a mixed black character is are very tired. This show doesn't seem much different. 

I support black media but if it's bad, it's just bad lmao. And if it doesn't seem like it's really for us or me, then I'm not gonna watch it. It really speaks volumes that the most popular things this man has made mostly casts light-skinned and/or mixed black women. It also reminds me how much more likely these women are to be cast in things.

So yeah, I'm not interested. And tbh, there aren't many sitcoms about families that I like anyway. \[shrugs\]"
858,Honestly I‚Äôm not a fan of his shows. This is just Black-Ish for Netflix.  Kenya Barris obviously uses the paper bag test to cast the actors and actresses on his shows. I‚Äôm gonna have to pass on this one lol.
859,"So it looks like they're going for a reality tv/sitcom theme, but the trailer didn't make me laugh once. It felt like the characters were trying way too hard to act 'black' and prove their blackness, particularly Rashida's character, and it made me cringe somewhat. The first thing I noticed was that all of the main characters were light brights, and it's just really annoying to see TV shows and movies only casting light skinned actresses, as if brown and dark skinned black people don't make up the majority of African Americans. As much as I wanna support black media I won't be watching this since it doesn't look like it'll be good and perpetuates colorism."
860,"I have no intentions of watching it, he rarely if ever casts dark skinned characters, plus his Twitter rants let me know he doesn't give af about the issue either. Rashida has mainly called herself ethic and mixed, so it's interesting she's in a show now claiming blackness

I get that blackness is a spectrum but it's disappointing that the majority of his characters easily pass a paper bag test and are mixed. Everyone one was crying and relating to the little black girl a couple of weeks ago calling herself ugly but not even black directors are working to mitigate the lack of dark skinned black girls in the media for her to look up to"
861,"I just...*sigh*.

I want to live in a world where a show with that title would cast a dark-skinned lead. Shit, I want to live in a world where *any and all* shows would cast dark-skinned women. Period. But apparently that's too much to fucking ask for."
862,"I haven't watched any of these shows. They all seem to be very interested in trying to water down the black experience for nonblack people to be able to digest. And I have nothing against Rashida (with the way her father is, I can see why she is the way she is, though), but that's who you pick for a show called Black AF? You'd think this would be the one show that would feature mostly dark-skinned black people or more of a rainbow of black people, but nope. I feel this person isn't good for representation, so I don't support them."
863,Not interested. this is blackish but with more money and some curse words. I wish he‚Äôd try writing about people who are not his family
864,Is this the first time Rashida has played a black character? Second maybe?
865,Just googled Rashida Jones. . . Didnt know she was black. . . ü§î
866,"Yeah, I don't fuck with Kenya Barris. 

His supporters tend to fall back on his tired, colorist formula as being based on ""his experience"". Correct me if I am wrong, but he filed for divorce from his wife recently. Like their marriage is over. So, not only is it not his experience anymore, he's using the life story of his ex-wife over and over again. Also, was he not black before his wife? Does he have parents? Like?

I will not be watching this, because unlike some some folks, I don't have to stick my hand in the fire more than once to know it's hot. Kenya Barris has made it quite clear that the black women he wants to see on TV should actually be mixed at all times, and he doesn't give a fuck about the implications of that."
867,"When I saw Rashida Jones and ‚ÄúBlack AF‚Äù was in the same sentence I thought I was being trolled. 

Of all people, Rashida? Does she even identify as black? I can‚Äôt and I won‚Äôt."
868,"I had hoped he had redeemed himself slightly with Astronomy Club... But nope, Kenya Barris is still his same, colorist self. Hard pass."
869,I wish they would make a show called White AF and put a black girl that‚Äôs 25% white.
870,I understand what you mean about wanting more representation of darker skin tones. The tone of some ppl in here is diminishing the blackness of rashida and other black women who happen to be lighter and I don‚Äôt agree with that point. We need not put light black women down and say they aren‚Äôt enough to be black equally.
871,I lol‚Äôd at the idea of Rashida being ‚Äòblack af.‚Äô She‚Äôs the most white passing biracial woman that they could pick.
872,I wanna Say her character in Boston Public identifed as Black
873,"I‚Äôve always thought that Rashida looks so much like this old Hollywood actress named Fredi Washington, who could pass for white but refused to do so."
874,Her father is Quincy Jones.
875,LOL at having a show called ‚Äúblack af‚Äù and starting a racially ambiguous woman.
876,Just her and black af being in the same sentence is a shoulder shrugger. People gonna watch but I won't be one of them.
877,"I feel she barely plays black characters on tv shows either. She's also stated in interviews that she doesn't identify as much with her black side as her sister.

It's the worst person to cast for a show called Black AF LOL"
878,[removed]
879,"Hell no, and the one drop rule is trash."
880,Nah until dark skin women can get a platform I‚Äôm not really trying to hear the racially ambiguous and or mixed complain about being teased. They knew what they were doing.
881,[removed]
882,Ain't she Quicy's daughter? I just steer clear of the whole topic of identity these days. I just know the type of black person I am is giving the whole thing a side eye and nothing more. üòÇ
883,"Personally for me her being mixed isn't the issue, it's that she's actively profited off her white passing ability in ways no other actress has, to my knowledge. She only seems to publicly acknowledge her blackness in the same way that folks like Miley and Justin use blackness to build Street cred. 

I wouldn't really take issue with say, Halle Berry. Well, no additional issues than the name and the show runner bring out lol"
884,I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. I just don‚Äôt agree with the disparaging light skinned black women. I‚Äôm interested in watching at least the first episode to see how she does.
885,That‚Äôs wrong and hateful. But you do you
886,Lol how is it hateful to refer to a biracial person as biracial?! I love my biracial family members and they shouldn‚Äôt be forced to identify as black because of a racist one drop rule.
887,They are biracial meaning both races. They are black and they are the other. I‚Äôm not saying to force them to identify as black. They can identify as both or either if they choose to do so. To say they aren‚Äôt black is the hateful part. One of their parents is black which validates them to identify as black.
888,"Half white=white?
This makes no sense. Duality can exist."
889,If you don‚Äôt understand it then please do some research. I‚Äôm not trying to come from a negative place. As a black and hispanic woman I think it‚Äôs important that we understand and respect each other and lift each other up.
890,"Wow, that's incredible, I'm amazed that they're still finding more survivors! (Though to be clear, she is now the last known survivor *in the US*; it's likely that the last survivor in the world died in the 1960s or even 1970s in Cuba or Brazil.)

Two further resources: [Dreams of Africa in America](https://www.amazon.com/Dreams-Africa-Alabama-Clotilda-Africans-ebook-dp-B00WBN4Q22/dp/B00WBN4Q22/) by Sylviane A. Diouf is a book about the survivors of the Clotilde, the last slave ship known to reach the US, and the recently published [Barracoon](https://www.amazon.com/Barracoon-Story-Last-Black-Cargo-ebook/dp/B071YRWK84/) is the story of Oluale Kossola/Cudjo Lewis told through interviews with Zora Neale Hurston; he also survived the Clotilde, and was long thought to be the last survivor in the US."

956,Are you by any chance overweight or obese? It could be a symptom of diabetes/prediabetes
957,"Have you been to a dermatologist or even an esthetician? You can ask for their opinion. Maybe even consider a chemical peel...

Outside of that, I loveeee vitamin c because it‚Äôll brighten your skin (not whiten). And always use sunscreen."
958,"I have the same problem. Do you wear sunscreen every time you're out in the sun? Also, what are the ingredients in the creams your mom gives you?"
959,"I have a similar issue, it's not extreme but it's enough for me to notice. I tan pretty easily so I'm literally 5 different shades across my body. I used have really bad dark marks from acne which made the difference significantly worse but I now have a pretty solid skincare routine to help. 

What I think you're experiencing is a retinol burn from the creams being too strong wich is causing hyperpigmentation marks. My derm gave me a generic version of triluma to help and I experienced a similar issue. When using them, it's dire you avoid direct sunlight and use sunscreen. 

What Im currently doing is using a [toner](https://alaviskin.com/collections/all-products-1/products/mango-papaya-puree-toners) to remove my dark marks and then I'll use [hyper](https://gethyperskin.com/), which brightens (not whitens) my skin. Plenty of dark skinned women use it and their faces aren't whiter then the rest of their body it just gives them a very nice glow. 

Going to a derm will help because they can provide you with serums and creams to match your skins sensitivity. 

These are the other products I used that helped me (theyre also all black owned üòä),
[pine tar black soap](https://www.donata.co/collections/skin-food/products/pine-tar-soap), [rose galore serum ](https://moonxcosmeticsllc.net/products/rose-galore-1), [rose petal toner ](https://richandclear.com/products/rose-petal-toner)"
960,"Try ambi fade cream and also exfoliating helps. I used it to get rid of hyperpigmentation on my upper lip and it works pretty fast. Also don‚Äôt let your moms comments make you self conscious about your skin, no one has totally even and flawless skin it‚Äôs normal to have some type of discoloration :)"
961,"I have the same issue and it got worse now that I'm pregnant again. I've been using vitamin e oil, Shea butter, cetaphil face soap and African black soap and it's gotten my skin looking moisturized and even toned to my neck and chest again."
962,No I don't have any of those which is why I'm so confused
963,I can't afford a dermatologist atm and a chemical peel makes my skin worse. What brand do you use that contains vitamin c?
964,"I got my first Covid ""you up"" text today, from the guy who broke my heart 2 years ago. Had he messaged me 6 months ago I would've replied. Today however I just had to smile to myself instead.

965,"My new prescription sunglasses arrived yesterday, and they are *so* boss! I managed to find a pair of aviator frames that don't overwhelm my face, and they can read as both masculine and feminine. The only thing I would change is, they're tinted black, and I prefer brown. But they were free, so I might not say anything. Or, depending on how I feel after wearing them for a little while, I may ask them to replace the lenses if I can't deal with it."
966,"I've been so tired this past week. Had a fever yesterday, a sore throat and some mucus build up. No dry cough so probably just a regular cold. Can't wait for the weekend to rest. I should call in sick but don't want to use my PTO, especially since I'm working from home today."
967,"Things were going well with school before the covid outbreak. Now, I'm feeling super unmotivated but I'm doing my best lol. I'm trying to not drink caffeine because I have nowhere to go or a reason to drink caffeine but...I had some today and now I feel extremely chatty with no one to talk to lol."
968,"I fucking hate this fucking virus. COVID-19 is slowly becoming my own personal nightmare. I can't see my SO, because he got furloughed (I think I said laid-off last week but actually furloughed) from his regular job so he got a part time job at a grocery store... Where everyone is going and everyone else in my house is high risk so I'm fucking lonely. Plus I can't go anywhere. I would walk but all my neighbors had the same idea and not all of them understand social distancing. Plus I had to move my therapist appointment from in person to online... Which is also annoying because the only way to ensure my privacy is to sit in one of the cars in the garage... Which I don't super want to do but don't have much choice (any advice for making my room more private is appreciated. I can have music playing in the adjoining room but idk what to do about the hall)."
969,"With everything going on, i'm still looking to get out of my current job (I know...) I've been wanting to leave for almost a year now...looking for a wfh job before I leave (which was what I had started doing about a few weeks before all hell broke loose with COVID-19) and i'm actually hoping I get fired. I feel like so wrong for thinking this with the job market and what's ahead but I've been at a mental and physical limit for months now."
970,"Just a folllow up to woman who made the post a few days ago about negative body image and [comments made by older black women](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/fn9x88/do_any_of_you_deal_with_parents_saying_hurtful/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

I left a comment on the post talking about my struggle with anorexia. I remember my family getting annoyed with me when I first went to therapy and revealed what I was dealing with because eating disorders are a ‚Äúwhite girl problem.‚Äù I‚Äôve hid my struggle with eating from most people in my life for a long time because I believed them. So when I read your post and all the responses, I was shocked to see how many other black women were struggling with body image and disordered eating who‚Äôd had family experiences that were very similar to mine. Honestly, I‚Äôve been thinking about your post all week.

Then BAM! Today I just happened to have this talk show on in the background while I was doing other stuff around the house and she had TWO BLACK SISTERS and a BLACK PSYCHOLOGIST who were talking about their struggle with bulimia(!!!!!!!!!!)

The psychologist also talked about a new study has found that the rate of bulimia in black teenagers is higher than any other group in population(!!!!!!!!) The doctor also said the reason the problem is so prolific is because discussions of mental health are considered so taboo in the black community, so black women are more likely to suffer with these issues in silence. 

You guys. I am in shock. I thought for so many years that it was just me."
971,I did my hair today and put on earrings. I can't remember the last time I wore shoes. I really need for this pandemic to end!

979,"On one hand since they're admitting they see you primarily as a sex object you avoid having to waste any additional time with them. Compatibility can be rare but if it happens, it happens. Until then I wouldn't waste any energy on appealing to men. If they want to see you as an equal, they will, and from what I've seen in life the feeling will be a lot better if or when that happens."
980,"Story of my life, good enough to make an option but not good enough to be a priority. I've been platonically chatting with a guy recently and he said guys probably take my shyness as insecurity and low confidence. Definitely is an option because I am all of those things lol. He suggested I make more first moves and show I'm interested."
981,Men in their early 20s really just want to have sex. They not thinking about anything outside of that. They will say what they need to say to have sex and say what they need to say stay out of anything more serious than that.
982,"I‚Äôve never heard this, but ironically I‚Äôve had a lot of guys tell me that I‚Äôm pretty/beautiful, but that they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm necessarily a sexy person. And I‚Äôve had guys tell me that they didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd have chance with me though, and that‚Äôs why it took them so long to make a move.

I think a lot of the time it feels like men don‚Äôt really want to love me, but that they want to own me? Like they want to date me so they can show me off, but its  actually more the idea of me, than who I am as a person, that they‚Äôre in love with. Idk if that‚Äôs what you mean with romantic attraction."
983,"This isn‚Äôt exactly what you are saying, but I keep meeting men who just don‚Äôt seem that excited about me, and it‚Äôs pretty disheartening.

We‚Äôll chat for a while, and then it‚Äôll just die. I‚Äôm trying not to take it personally of course, but I miss the (increasingly) rare times in my life when me and a guy just hit it off and started dating from there. It‚Äôs been several years since that happened."
984,"So I get that. I have recently been dealing with guys who want to gas me up and tell me that they like my looks, but at the end of day, they just want nudes. So for a long time, I wasn't sure if I was actually attractive or they were just trying to gas me up. I'm trying to have a higher bar for my engagement with dudes because like the other commenters said, most dudes our age are only looking for sex. Do not let them bog you down."
985,"I feel this so much, I could‚Äôve wrote it myself. I‚Äôm also 23 and have the same problem. It‚Äôs always the same thing, and I try to rationalize it but get nowhere. I get told I‚Äôm attractive and I have a nice personality, so I‚Äôm always trying to figure out exactly what it is that‚Äôs so off putting. When I talk about it everyone says there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me, but as weird as it sounds, I almost wish there was something fixable wrong with me so I could fix it and then have better luck."
986,"Of course looks play into whether a man will find you attractive but I also believe that your personality, how you hold yourself (are you standoffish, pushover, laid back etc), what decisions you've made in life (are you accomplished at anything, do you have debt, do you have a good career)  and also skill sets (ie. Cooking or some other skill you're good at) is what attracts a man to thinking that you're relationship material. Maybe think about what it is that you bring to the table. If you're looking to grow w a man and not just have a fling abd try for marriage, start to gain life experiences that'll add to that sort of dynamic, if you haven't already.

edit: I also want to add that how you're dressed affects how men see you. You might think that's wrong or that you should be able to wear w.e and not be sexualized but that's just not how it is in reality. If you wear revealing clothes especially as a black woman (we've been sexualized since slavery) then you're more than likely to just get attention for your body and these men that approach you will only want you for sex. Men that want a girlfriend or wife might look at that and think slut. Don't compare yourself to the media just bc some celeb w her thang out got married. I say this out of experience and what men have told me.

Another thing to add is what are your values? Are your morals etched out? Can u hold a conversation or is it just the basics and that's it? Hope I didn't overwhelm you w all I wrote."
987,Is it your personality perhaps?
988,You‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm just getting caught up in rationalizing something that doesn‚Äôt make sense anyway. If you haven‚Äôt had a lot of success you start to doubt yourself and invent reasons why things aren‚Äôt going your way. Unproductive
989,"Yeah don‚Äôt listen to him. It won‚Äôt really help your confidence to put yourself out there like that because a lot of guys see that as desperation. Women approaching first is what they say they want but there‚Äôs still a stigma around women being assertive about their own dating life.

I‚Äôve approached several guys a few years ago. Nothing came of that besides the guy being like, ‚Äúthanks for the compliment.‚Äù No real solutions here but I‚Äôm just going to intentionally be alone. It‚Äôs much easier making it a choice than waiting for something to happen that clearly isn‚Äôt working atm"
990,"If that were true, then I wouldn‚Äôt see some of my friends in relationships. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, a lot of younger men aren‚Äôt looking for anything serious. But there‚Äôs still a good amount of them that will actually commit to an exclusive relationship. 

So far, haven‚Äôt seen a lot of them commit to me. So it does have me questioning a few things."
991,"That‚Äôs interesting. I mean, I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs possible guys can get intimidated but it‚Äôs more rare than women realize.

What I was referring to was that the guys would obviously be attracted to me. We would be compatible in all the good ways and have the same values. But for whatever reason, they can‚Äôt bring themselves to see me in a romantic light (to date). They have no problem desiring me sexually though.

It makes me feel like perhaps there‚Äôs a barrier between me and them that makes the guys feel like I cannot relate to them as a romantic partner. Idk how to describe it but it‚Äôs alienating. It‚Äôs troublesome when they can‚Äôt pinpoint anything specifically wrong with me or our connection at all"
992,"Same. Im darkskin but people have told me that I have a unique face and have been romantically attracted to me. I've never been called sexy in my life because I have no boobs üò≠ If people are only sexually attracted to you then that means they're attracted to your body and not really your face. I think men are able to acknowledge when someone's attractive but just because someone's good looking doesn't mean they necessarily want to date them. 

Also did guys think they didn't have a chance with you partially because you have closed body language or naw? Cause that's what I'm going through right now"
993,"I have yet to experience that. All I want is to hit it off with the guy and start dating. I recently met a guy that I hit it off with and it was obvious he liked me. Then out of nowhere, he decided he didn‚Äôt want a relationship anymore and started being a douche. Now that I think about it, not sure if he was excited about me. Didn‚Äôt date long enough to find out.The whole situation was very weird. 

It‚Äôs rare to find a guy who you actually like and even rarer to meet someone who is equally excited about you."
994,Yeah a lot of them just want sex. It‚Äôs very odd bc the same men will hop on here and act like women are being crazy irrational with our expectations. Like?? Most of us just want companionship and to be exclusively dicked down. It‚Äôs not rocket science at all
995,I see where you‚Äôre coming from. It‚Äôs not helpful if you don‚Äôt get constructive feedback on what you can work on. I‚Äôm starting to realize that there may not be anything wrong with us because attraction is that complex.
996,"I mean, you‚Äôre just describing a well adjusted adult? And if that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôm more self sufficient at 23 than a lot of people my age.

I have a college degree. I have a good paying job that allows for me to be comfortable. I have a cute cat. I have several hobbies (painting, ballet and cooking). I‚Äôm a good conversationalist - all the men I‚Äôve been with have acknowledged our conversations are stimulating intellectually. I‚Äôm a very modest dresser? I don‚Äôt go to clubs or anything so I don‚Äôt have a lot of revealing clothes.

But even if none of those things were true, hoes get wifed up every day? I‚Äôm as respectable as it gets but even if I wasn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd still be worthy of love and appreciation. Why is it that black women (myself included) feel like we have to have our shit 100% together to prove we are worthy of basic love and respect in our romantic relationships. Love isn‚Äôt merit based.

But anyway. I‚Äôve just let this topic go entirely bc I can‚Äôt find anything particularly wrong with me that is ‚Äúright‚Äù with everyone else."
997,It‚Äôs always a possibility. Not sure what about my personality would cause that though
998,"Yeah of course I'm not going to be throwing myself at guys but it his statement did cause self introspection. I am really shy and I don't have much confidence so I probably come off as closed off and scared. And no one who is in a good place themselves is looking for a fixer upper or a project as a relationship option. I'm not looking for any relationship right now and instead just want to work on myself and be happy with myself because at my age being shy is no longer really considered endearing.

Obviously this is just a me thing but in general I'm saying there might be something these guys are picking up on that makes them not want a relationship. It's just annoying finding someone honest enough to say what it is because everyone is always like ""don't worry the right guy will come"" üôÑ"
999,It may look exclusive...nevermind. You just have to go through it and keep on living. Just letting you know what I've learned from experience. Don't question yourself tho. Just focus on yourself and your personal goals. Men's decisions don't have as much to do with you as you think.
1000,"That sounds really weird and fishy of them, especially when it‚Äôs multiple guys. Is it mostly black men or white/other men? And why do you think it‚Äôs a colorism issue?"
1001,"I think for it may be because I‚Äôm kind of weird in the way I dress? I also have rejected a lot of guys at my school so I do have a certain reputation lol. I definitely don‚Äôt have an open or inviting body language so it may play a role !

You‚Äôre lucky to have a unique face! The only unique thing about me is freckles and perhaps my hair. I‚Äôm sadly one of those light skin girls who was convinced that they were very beautiful from a young age, even though it‚Äôs not really the truth. I mean I‚Äôm not homely but I‚Äôm not beautiful either, i think I‚Äôm just decently pretty. I am also not curvy at all, I‚Äôm p slim and am a c cup so my body doesn‚Äôt really conform to black beauty standards. 

Regardless, I‚Äôve never really had much trouble with men wanting to just have sex with me. I think because I don‚Äôt have the vibe of being an easy going or casual girl, so men don‚Äôt really approach me unless they‚Äôre serious lmao."
1002,"Maybe rn isn't the time. Perhaps that man you're looking for will come later in life. I didn't meet my husband till I was 24 turning 25 and before that I was in the same boat as you in terms of being dissatisfied w the men that would approach me, mostly wanting just a sexual relationship. You've described yourself as a capable and independent woman so I'm guessing it'll only b a matter of time."
1003,"Based on reading your replies, I have to say that you should never go into the dating world trying to impress men. Men should always be trying to impress you. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with you. 

You have to believe that you are the baddest woman out there, and own it. Men say they want a woman like a, b, and c. But they really have no idea what they want. 

It‚Äôs not entirely a race thing, because many women are unsatisfied with their dating lives. Men have been getting off too easily nowadays. Make them impress you."
1004,"I wasn‚Äôt saying you were desperate, I‚Äôm saying men will perceive it that way. Men say a lot of shit but they have the self awareness of a celery stalk sis. I don‚Äôt think we can take much of what they say seriously.

Now if you personally feel you have some growing to do, I wish you all the best. I‚Äôm not dating anymore either - I took a sabbatical from dating a while back. I only made an exception for one guy and he proved that was pointless so ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Focusing on yourself is the best solution. Men won‚Äôt give you good answers, actionable steps or anything useful besides projections of what they want or heard about in their circle. So what you‚Äôre planning on doing to make yourself whole is probably enough in my opinion"
1005,"I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs either race, largely because I‚Äôve only talked to maybe one black guy? Haven‚Äôt had many experiences with black guys and dating so I can‚Äôt make any real judgments there.

Colorism is a possibility because it‚Äôs one thing for me to actively do or say something they (meaning the men) didn‚Äôt like. But if I have no problem being attractive to them and they enjoy my company, what is the actual problem? If the guy can‚Äôt seem to figure out why he‚Äôs not interested and can‚Äôt articulate anything wrong, then perhaps it‚Äôs a subconscious bias."
1006,"I have been guilty of that in the past, but I have focused a lot less on trying to impress men. Weirdly by dating men of all races, I feel less pressure to compete for men? Don‚Äôt know how to explain it but that scarcity mindset was the most troubling when I went on a date with a black guy I liked who was educated. 

Currently I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how to actually engage with men. Not even to impress them. Just in general. Dating has so many rules that seemingly contradict each other. It seems to get what I want (in this case, I want a stable bf) I need to engage with men in a specific way to drum up attraction. I‚Äôve read enough books on how to do that, but it isn‚Äôt lasting and it‚Äôs still very surface level. The attraction is superficial and doesn‚Äôt seem to strike an emotional chord like I would hope. It‚Äôs all very confusing and tiring. A lot of work for very little payoff"
1007,"Yeah, I know that's not what you were saying and you're right, some men find anything beyond demure flirting as being too forward. Dudes prefer initiating and side eye anyone who chases them at least from what I've seen.

Thanks, I'm just tired of being an option so if others won't put me first then I will. I always take dating advice I get with a grain of salt because more often than not it comes from people who have no issues with dating lol. Better to just focus on ourselves."
1008,"That‚Äôs fair, I‚Äôve generally not had a lot of experience with black men either, just because of the area I grew up in. 

Tbh it may be colorism, I think it influences the way men think about women a lot more than they‚Äôre aware of. Personally I‚Äôm light skinned/mixed looking, and I often feel men are drawn to me because the way I look fits into their ‚Äúidea‚Äù of who they want to date, almost as if it‚Äôs an actual quality they‚Äôre looking for in a partner. That goes for white men as well as black men though"
1009,"That sounds like a good plan! I would also look into finding what kind of sexuality you are. I was floating through life wondering why romantic relationships weren‚Äôt working out, and then I realized I have a particular sexuality in which I can‚Äôt feel sexual attraction unless I make an emotional connection first.

Also, go and read the blog by Evan Marc Katz. He writes really helpful information about love, dating, and relationships."
1010,"I was talking to a co-worker and he was describing things about women he liked. All the stuff he was talking about...implied non black women.

Ex: having a high pony tail with the neck exposed (the long hairs hanging behind her head just does it for him)

Men are incredibly shallow and I just don‚Äôt think many of them even consider black women until actually posed with the idea. Why would they? White people in this country can unintentionally avoid black people bc there‚Äôs not many of us to begin with. So yeah, I just think a lot of men have this unconscious bias towards what is familiar and common"
1011,"I think that's probably true. Idk if its always a bad thing though, when I compare my dating life/experiences with men to my white and asian friends, it usually works out in my favor precisely because I don't ""disappoint"". Like if you're a white or asian woman (who dates white men, not black men bc, I mean you know what I mean) you're competing with an amazing media depiction, so if you don't live up to it, you're not gonna be seen as that desirable anyway. Idk its probably really individual, but I think for me its worked out really well to never be anyones ""type"""
1012,"I guess it‚Äôs about how you perceive it. I absolutely want to be considered a man‚Äôs ideal type. That‚Äôs very difficult to do because most men are shallow AND colorist so I doubt I‚Äôm their preference.

But generally speaking, the only way to ensure he‚Äôs not settling for me is if I know I am his ideal or preferred. I need him to believe he can‚Äôt do better than me. I believe if the man isn‚Äôt 100% in love and convinced he won the jackpot, he‚Äôll treat the woman he‚Äôs with like she is common. I see it too often"
1013,"I totally get that, but for me I don‚Äôt want a man to not think he can do better than me bc that‚Äôs what would feel like settling to me. I definitely agree that men often settle for women they don‚Äôt really feel are prized to them -and subsequently feel entitled to treat them badly because they don‚Äôt really want them anyway. 

I also think men‚Äôs ideals are often very loosely defined and change a lot based on who they‚Äôre in love with? Like I am not a person who fits into a type look, or at least not a very common one. I don‚Äôt think any man grows up having a thing for  ginger black girls with freckles and the shapeless body of a tiktok maker, so for me it‚Äôs kind of unrealistic to expect a guy to have dreamt me up before ever meeting me lmao. But in my experience guys tend to like the way I look anyway, and then fall in love with me. I think ultimately it doesn‚Äôt come down to preference or ideals, but attraction(however biased) m?"
1014,"it's less of the ""black person dies first"" trope and more of the magical negro trope. rue only exists as an instigator for the plot, and maybe a bit as a tool for katniss's character development. the book gains nothing with her character and loses nothing without her. it's just classic tokenism

also random, but all my (white) friends thought that informing me that collins made the district full of black people the agricultural district was super woke and not just straight up racist. like, come on... can you say white utopia??

maybe i'm reading too far into this lmfao"
1015,I personally didn‚Äôt think too much into it.
1016,"From what I saw, the Rue's race wasn't mentioned in the books which is why a bunch of people were outraged at the fact that she was played by a black girl in the movie. So I don't think it was a black person dies first trope. Though now I do wonder if they made her character be played by a black girl to add that trope in anyway while still seeming like they had a ""diverse"" cast.

Edit: okay I guess I'm wrong for some reason no one is telling me..."
1017,"Agree, but consider this: cinna was the ultimate magical negro in the hunger games. Dude literally got himself killed so she could have a dress and a really cool bow lmao"
1018,"I feel like she also has some ""fridge girl"" elements, although that's usually with a male protagonist."
1019,">‚Äúa twelve-year-old girl from District 11. She has dark brown skin and eyes, but other than that, she‚Äôs very like Prim in size and demeanor.‚Äù

The description from the book. Personally when I read it, it conveyed that she was black to me, but idk"
1020,"It could be a few things honestly, without actually witnessing the exchange or knowing the people involved, it's kinda hard to completely judge. 



Finding a good travel buddy is so hard. I think a lot of people get into disagreements when travelling. I've had a few similar incidents with traveling with others. If I know I really want to enjoy my trips, I'll either travel alone, travel with like minded people, or just do my own thing when I don't want to join for their activities. For example I hate travelling with my cousin because she will literally make the entire trip about herself, instead of it being what we both want to do.  

It could be the way you're communicating your opinion across to people, it may come off as being difficult. Are you suggesting compromises?

Also to be honest, your friend that you went to Asia with reminds me of my cousin. The fact that she still talks about it like she didn't have fun doing the things you suggested"
1021,"I have the exact same experiences when I travel with people . They are not on the same ‚Äúlove the experience ‚Äú level with you and sorry you have to find out this way. A lot of friends I know are amazing to be with, but horrible travel buddies. If I don‚Äôt know someone that well, I don‚Äôt commit to hanging out with them the whole day. From the jump I would tell them that I will do a solo thing and maybe one or two activities together. Once I have my ‚Äúfirst‚Äù travel experience with them, I can tell if they are a good travel buddy or not. If they are, I will invite them to my ‚Äúsolo‚Äù trips, if not we can always hang out later and I don‚Äôt actually insult them. You don‚Äôt actually have to tolerate other people‚Äôs bull. I simply just get up and leave."
1022,"Hmmm. I think the other comments are valid regarding the differences in people's approach to traveling. Everybody vacations differently & tbh, it seems that you almost need to have a compatibility conversation before traveling with other people. It's that real.

But to go further, in my opinion, it sounds to me that maybe you just attract these same kinds of people that perpetuate the idea that you're difficult, whether that is reality or not. Sounds more like a ""them"" problem than a you problem. I mean, it's cheese in a dish that you don't want cheese in. No big deal lol. 

I'll go even further and share with you what my therapist shared with me in my session just this week. It's not groundbreaking, but she said that none of your friends should be having extreme reactions to you making a request/suggestion/difference of opinion. That is the crux of healthy relationships. So if that is happening, that isn't necessarily you (if you are calm, reasonable, etc). You're running into a shortcoming/trigger on their end that they need to work on. They have an issue of their own that is driving that response. We were discussing the importance of having difficult conversations, but this seems to apply to your situation, too.

I don't have a suggestion for you, but wanted to share this with you, in case it might be helpful."
1023,This is why I prefer travelling alone because otherwise I have to compromise and I don't have as much freedom as I do when travelling solo.
1024,"It's hard to say, but since this has happened several times with different people, it's worth doing some introspection. In my experience, the moments you described are boiling points, but there may have been a previous pattern of behaviour that people have found upsetting. I don't know enough here to say if that's the case here or why, but some good things to check for might be how you communicate disagreements/differences in opinions, whether people understand where you're coming from (and if not, how to improve that understanding), and whether other people feel like you compromise enough (and if not, whether their expectations are reasonable).

I'll add that travelling with other people can be very difficult, so those experiences might not actually be too concerning. You know your situation best, though."
1025,"In the discussions with my mom, it is possible that the way I approach them isn‚Äôt the best because there is so much resentment built there already. My mom simply does not listen to me when I tell her anything and has made it a habit (a 20+ years habit) of always comparing me to my sister when she disagrees with me, my sister who has been very physically, emotionally, and psychologically abusive to me for years!! I absolutely LOATHE that. My mom expects me to accept everything she says whether it makes sense or not, whether it is logical or not, whether it is factual or not. It‚Äôs like I am not allowed to disagree or state a different opinion. Meanwhile she has no issue saying that what I am doing is wrong, which I don‚Äôt mind because I know I‚Äôm not always right, unless it‚Äôs something that I know for a fact is right and she wants me to be wrong and acquiesce just because I‚Äôm the child. I started out the cooking asking her for her opinion on various things and letting her take the lead on everything because she cooks more regularly than I do. but there were certain things I didn‚Äôt agree with, like first rinsing the chicken with cold water after doing a cleaning with lemon, and then doing another round of cleaning with hot water right after: I was annoyed because the hot (boiling) water would do the exact same thing and is already partly cooking the chicken, but did it anyway. And then putting cheese in a potato salad that doesn‚Äôt require cheese when we‚Äôre both at least mildly lactose intolerant and already have a dish full of cheese. Adding bechamel sauce to a potato salad just because she had extra (which she turned into ‚Äúoh I always do that‚Äù when I asked her why, which I know she doesn‚Äôt). Because I didn‚Äôt agree with these things when I agreed with everything else, I am difficult and my sister would have been fine with it. She acted like I was questioning her ability to cook (even though I was legit asking for her opinion on most things and took all but 3 of them)."
1026,"Yeah, I‚Äôm an ENFP but on the really introverted side. What made you interested in MBTI? I had a phase when I was mildly obsessed lol."

1105,"I‚Äôve known since undergrad that I wanted to work in a lab for my career, but when I got a job as a path tech I found out about more options in pathology. I wanted to be a pathologist at first until I realized that medical school wasn‚Äôt for me after a couple unsuccessful MCATs & not wanting to go back to school for that long. So then I shadowed a few PA‚Äôs & found out they pretty much do my same job but have more responsibilities & get paid way more. & even better the program is only 2 years!"
1106,Also thank you!!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
1107,"Thanks! To be honest I‚Äôm not sure how diverse the field is as far as POCs, but all the PAs I know are female. I would definitely go shadow an autopsy or a PA to see if the field is for you! üíï"
1108,"A PA basically ‚Äúgrosses‚Äù surgical specimens, dissects said specimens, & rarely will do autopsies depending on where you work."
1109,I was turned off from med school for the same reasons too. Interesting how we can stumble across great careers as we go about our lives. Love that you're doing what you want and securing the bag while you're at it!
1110,"he went to rest and then found her dead, that's so heartbreaking

on top of that he has diabetes and they aren't even giving him information on whether his wife had covid or not? 

terrible situation, I feel really bad for this man. I hope he stays healthy and gets answers."
1111,If everyone who isn‚Äôt dying stays home we will have a lot easier time getting to the ones who are. Please stay home and stay safe.
1112,Similar story happened in Atlanta. Also a black women.
1113,"And this is exactly what I'm expecting as supplies and help run low. ""Certain"" people are going to be priority and others won't, no matter what. Like, this woman should have been taken in immediately, since she had the signs they tell us to seek medical help for. Like, huh? In what world was she not a priority? And if her husband had diabetes, he should have been being monitored, as well.

And I hate how people are trying to say this is the fault of universal healthcare, so that's why we don't need it. No, it's the fault of people not taking some cases seriously enough. Has nothing to do with universal healthcare. Ugh."
1114,So scary. Poor man.  :(
1115,"He's essentially been abandoned/put on the back burner because of all the chaos. They probably have zero capacity to follow up with him. I have no idea how things are being prioritised, they're saying they're testing people if they meet hospitalisation thresholds but then clearly not everyone who should be admitted is being admitted, so those people aren't being tested. They're saying they're prioritising the young with serious symptoms but then this young woman wasn't even advised to leave and go to a hospital at all. Things are changing every second and not a single soul knows what the hell to do. And the way this illness seems to progress during its last stages is truly the stuff of horror films."
1116,"There's definitely needs to be clarity, in this situation she should've been a priority. 

it's hard because in this situation it's difficult to even blame the responders. The system is just so stressed. An Italian doctor admitted in the chaos of treating covid-19 cases the hospital would sometimes forget to even notify family when a patient died. 

and someone filmed the inside of an Italian hospital, that was a true horror film. It made my blood run cold. I still don't think most people know just what we are in for."
1117,"I saw bits of that vid, I knew I couldn't watch all of it. Terrified as they keep saying we're only about 2/3 weeks behind Italy, it's going to be carnage"
1118,Everyone‚Äôs acting like things will get better in April but I highly doubt it. My job even said they‚Äôre going to open back. I work for a school system and I highly doubt it.
1119,"Wigs. Haven't had a weave in over 7 years. Everytime I got weave, my edges looked crazy."
1120,"Wigs! When I was wearing a weave, I would always do a leave out and always heat damage it. I tried a frontal once, but I need to wash my hair every two weeks on the dot or it‚Äôs itch city and to me the price for the bundles, a frontal, and the install wasn‚Äôt worth only two weeks of wear. I like glueless wigs cause at the end of the day I can take them off and tend to my scalp beneath and they don‚Äôt ruin my edges. And they‚Äôre fun! And versatile I can have a curly bob one day and a long body wave the next it‚Äôs wonderful."
1121,"Wigs. They're so much easier; I can just take it off to tend my hair or whatever, and then put it back on in a snap."
1122,Wigs. Not having to deal with blending a leave out and I still have access to my natural hair for hair care purposes
1123,Weaves. Especially with the closure available. I find my hair grows better with weaves. Wigs eat away at my edges way too much.
1124,"Weaves or a u part, even though wigs are the better option financially.

I just hate the way the top of wigs look. That fake scalp kills me. They lookin weird to me."
1125,glue or glueless?
1126,"Glueless. I use a wig cap, wig clips and bobby pins to secure the wig."
1127,Anderson.Paak last June. His live performances are amazing
1128,It‚Äôs a tie between Beyonce and Janet Jackson for me. Both are great performers!
1129,"Omg I went to the Formation tour as well, it was phenomenal! Was so hype in there that I was hitting ALL the notes to Love on Top -- that's how you know it's real ü§£"
1130,Glow in the Dark Tour. Rih opened. Crazy looking at their careers now.
1131,Tank and the Bangas!
1132,"Flaming Lips. It was awesome, it was like a big ass trippy birthday party and I can‚Äôt wait to see them again"
1133,"My Chemical Romance. It was a full trip; place was full of weed (though I don't partake, myself, lol) and they were playing Tupac before they came on stage. It was like the best of both worlds, for me.

If I could go back to see a concert... there's so many, but Prince is at the top of my list."
1134,Lady GaGa Monster Ball
1135,Janet Jackson's SOTW tour. She still can move
1136,"It‚Äôs hard to say, so I always say the first that comes to mind.

Which is Flying Lotus at the moment, and that shit was wild"
1137,"Panic! At the Disco. Holy cow he sounds even better live, and I've been into that band since middle school and it lived up to all my expectations. I can't wait to see him again!"
1138,"Tom Misch! He sounds great live, had great chemistry with his band, the lighting was incredible, and the energy in the crowd that night was contagious. 

As for who I want to see next, I haven't seen someone who is a great performer yet. Beyonce is one of the best, if not the best performers I know of, but I prefer smaller concerts so I'd be happy with someone less well known but very talented. Not yet sure who that would be."
1139,That was the best concert for me too!
1140,"My favorites have always been the cheaper ones -- small, general admission concerts where you can be close to the stage without paying a premium, and the crowd is full of folks who really like the artist regardless of income. But that's just a personal preference -- I went to see MUNA recently and it was really fun, even though it wasn't exactly my favorite band. Was looking forward to seeing 100 gecs next month"
1141,"Curren$y 
He was fully present... weaving and out of his set list so effortlessly... he rapped EVERY WORD!! No lip syncing"
1142,Sade or Erykah Badu
1143,"Mine is a toss up between Adam lambert and Disturbed. I was right up the barrier at the Lambert concert and OH.MY.GOD. Alex Newell and Tove Lo opened for him and oh my gosh. Alex Newell was just fresh off of Glee and killed it.

It was so good that a week later, I saw him again : same tour, different city.

 I like Disturbed so much that I have seen them for the last three tours they did. ü§òüèæ"
1144,I used to love My Chemical Romance!
1145,"Yeah, they're a pretty cool band."
1146,idk sis. youtube?
1147,"Girl, I feel it! I keep thinking about my threading appointment... üò©"
1148,Idk I‚Äôm almost out of 2/3 of my usual hair products... at this point I‚Äôm basically rationing
1149,"‚Ä¢ Funny(ish) thing: I told my manager yesterday I'd miss one of our syncs because I scheduled therapy in the mornings while I'm home. Today we had our 1:1 & he asked me why I go to therapy. I told him why I started & that in the process I figured out I'm gay. He asked me if I came out in October & I said yes. He said in October he thought I was visibly happier. He thought I was just happier from relocating, but now he knows what changed

‚Ä¢ Decided to distance myself from my crush for the next 3 weeks or more. I just felt too attached still. I'm not responding to anything without giving at least an hour of space first & I'm keeping myself to 1 text after 4 days, if I want to text her. I'm 4 days in today & she is double texting now & opening up about how she felt when we first met. She offered FaceTime but I think I should avoid that and try not to see her again until after quarantine. I'm just sick of the confusion at this point."
1150,"this CORONAVIRUS(cardi b voice) has dudes coming out the damn woodwork getting on my nerves. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always liked you‚Äù 


‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go out when this is over‚Äù 

Nah man, I‚Äôm good. 

I do have a lil crush on an old (literally and figuratively) coworker and we actually exchanged ‚ÄúI love you‚Äùs to eachother which was hella sweet. The ink was barely dry on his divorce papers when I asked him out so when he said he wasn‚Äôt  ready, I understood. Then he proceeded to compliment me which makes me want to fuck him even more. I put a little extra oomph in my hug and told him to hmu when he‚Äôs ready."
1151,"My boyfriend is pissing me off. He has this habit of doing shit I tell him not to do because he thinks he's right/he knows better. Unless my reason for not wanting you to touch/change my stuff is detrimental to our health or absolutely insane, just listen to me! 

And God forbid I ever let him know he's upsetting me. Now we have to talk about everything wrong I've ever done.

Fighting with people who don't know how to fight is exhausting. It wasn't even a huge deal, I just wanted to tell him how I felt about it, but it kept him up so late he emailed me while I was sleeping, and now it's a huge deal. üò©"
1152,"I hope my family comes out of this crisis with good relationships. I've been hearing so many stories about people fighting.

Don't have anything to say about dating this week, but if you do, join us at r/blackladiesdating!"
1153,"I got on Tinder this week because I desperately needed some type of human conversation. (Quarantine life is so boring!) I would barely send two messages to guys before they wanted hang out at my place. I get it, social isolation sucks. However, I don‚Äôt care if everything is closed! You are not coming over to my apartment tomorrow cause I don‚Äôt know you!"
1154,"How do you deal with knowing deep down that you aren‚Äôt as happy as you could be, while being scared to take the measures to achieve that happiness? Sorry if I‚Äôm being vague, just lost atm."
1155,I've been seeing your updates in the weekly threads for a while now and I just wanted to say that you seem like a lovely person with a lot of love to give. Rooting for you!
1156,">he emailed me while I was sleeping,

emailed you what?? About the fight?"
1157,That's very kind of you to say. I notice your comments as well. I really appreciate the encouragement!
1158,"YESSS

We have been staying up way too late because we're night owls and I no longer have to drive an hour to the office, so this fight started at 3:30 am and went until 5 am before I gave up and went to bed. 

He went down the list of things I said and just commented on them, same shit we were actually talking about in real life, it was useless but I guess he needed to get his anxiety out? idk"
1159,"okay there's nothing wrong with wanting to communicate in writing.. sometimes it's easier, calmer, more collected. But did this man just rage email you without prior discussion just to rehash what he already said? He shoulda kept that one in the drafts."
1160,oh also did you email him back?
1161,"lol absolutely not, he went back to sleep while I did some work and he was nice to me when he woke up, we took care of the dogs a bit and now he's sleeping again. I'm not addressing it until he's fully awake"
1162,"Everything about this pandemic scares me. People are finally paying attention to the problems we've been trying to address for decades. But what worse, is that I don't think they'll change it for the better. The government won't do a damn thing. There are people who try and pretend it wasn't that bad economically. We are going to be fucked for a couple of years."
1163,"I‚Äôm stressed.   So much so I‚Äôve been breaking out in hives since last week.   I‚Äôm an essential employee (for real not just employer being a jerk) so I‚Äôm still working.  There is even talk of us having to quarantine here at work for a few weeks.  My parents are older and won‚Äôt keep their asses in the house and also found out my mothers diabetes is out of control.    
My uncle is currently in ICU with what we suspect is COVID 19.  Been worrying about childcare but that problem has been resolved.  
Basically I‚Äôm barely holding it together right now."
1164,"I'm really enjoying my job so far. It still feels like there aren't enough hours in the day to get things done, but I need to start reminding myself of all the things I *do* get done. At this stage it's mostly reading and watching webinars. I'm honestly struggling a little bit to retain everything, because there's so much of it, and because I'm so anxious about the possibility that someone will ask me a question about it, and I'll come up with a blank. But so far I've asked really good questions, and had insightful observations, so clearly I'm doing *something* right. But anxiety is a hell of a drug."
1165,"I need some constructive criticism. 
I was 45 min late to my job and when I asked why I was honest and said I was having a conversation that I had trouble ending 

Can you guys pray for me to get hired again because it‚Äôs a nice job."
1166,"My current work project is wrapping up this week and it's hitting me that this shutdown is going to last for several more weeks or months. Work is probably going to be slow after this week and I need to make sure I stay mentally healthy. I've been avoiding going outside, but I need to start going for walks again. Also want to feed my spiritual & creative sides so I can be strong. I need to help my family but I've learned that it's hard to help others when I'm running on empty."
1167,I ended my water fast today (Day 9) but my anxiety is sky-rocketing through the roof over this coronavirus.  üò´
1168,Said a prayer for you & your family. Hugs.
1169,"Said a prayer for you. I think it's good that you want to be honest. There's also a saying that not all truths need to be told. Next time, you can say that you had an unexpected situation that you had to resolve but it took much longer than expected and won't happen again. It might have been good to let them know ahead of time that you were going to be late.

Also, why were you having trouble ending the conversation?"
1170,"I agree 1000% with what u/dramaticeggroll said, I don't think your honesty is a bad thing but in this situation it may have been better to twist the truth in order to gain more leniency from your employer

You also need to enforce boundaries around how much of your time you're giving to people. I know it's hard but you need to put your foot down in order to prevent things like this in the future. Prayers have been sent!"
1171,"Walks are definitely helpful. Make sure to bake things into your schedule that uplift & energize you throughout the day (virtual workshops, walks, meditation, podcasts/music/YouTube videos, etc)"
1172,Thank you.
1173,"Yes! I find I'm more likely to do self-care things when I schedule them, even if I enjoy doing them in the first place. When left to my own devices, I just turn into a potato."
1174,"I got through I think... two episodes, but I don‚Äôt think anyone in my immediate family watched it. However, the women in my family have had a few encounters with predatory individuals (some were relatives) and we‚Äôve talked about that before-and it‚Äôs not great. I think my people have internalized a lot of negative stuff as a result of these experiences and some (probably altered/twisted/manipulative) Christian views on their bodies as well as sex. Other than that, we had one conversation involving TI and Tiny. I argued there was some similarities (not precise examples) of abuse in that relationship, and how and why Tiny would be considered a victim and less of a coconspirator in her less-than-perfect marriage."
1175,"When arguing with family about how adolescent girls aren't mature enough for sex or even relationships with grown men, I learned that one of my uncles was 20 when he first met and pursued my aunt, who was only 10.


He passed before I was born, but I had always heard stories about how sweet he was, how in love they were, and how he waited for her to graduate high school to get married. I never knew what the age gap was, and didn't think much of it. They stayed together, had kids, and everyone in the family was presumably ok with it. He's still sorely missed. But, while defending R. Kelly, one of my cousins told me about it. She described how my uncle was working at a store next to the school where some kids would go and shop for snacks and stuff. My aunt would go over, and this grown man would flirt with her. At first she was nervous (big surprise), but after a while he charmed her. They'd hang out after school sometimes, and when she got a little older, they'd see movies together. He proposed right after graduation.


I was stunned. Some people in my family didn't like talking about it. Some people didn't see anything wrong with it, with people saying that he always truly loved her. Sadly, some women in my family have had physically abusive husbands, and he was considered one of the good husbands that would never lay a finger on his wife or hurt her in any way. It's been a while, and I'm still processing."
1176,"No, my family is in denial and will always be. They acted amped up about it and said things like ‚Äúif that were you or my child...‚Äù Suuuuree...

But my boyfriend had an interesting reaction. We were still long distance at the time and I he said how much the documentary upset him. It made him look at how he viewed women in HS (as just something to use/have sex with) and that made him feel like shit."
1177,"Thankfully, my family is mostly on the same page when it comes to sexual assault and such, so we all kind of were talking about how insane it was that he got away with it for so long and it sparked a conversation about how too many black men, and men in general, get away with sexual crimes against black women because people either don't care or they'd rather protect the predator than the victim.

However, some of my family members were trying to shift the blame onto the girls, even if they were underage, saying these girls were just ""fast"" (I hate that word with a passion) or trying to ""get over"" on R. Kelly because all of these girls ""knew what they were doing"". This is something that bugs me because I remember being talked to by older men and I can tell you, the last thing on my mind was trying to ""get over"" on them and I definitely knew nothing about men to know better, and too many people, women included, forget that girls, even up into their 20s, depending on life experience, are very ignorant of men, so they wouldn't know better, either. Yet, they expect girls under 18 to ""know better""?  And did you try to **teach** them ""better"" rather than shaming them and calling them ""fast"" every chance you got? It's like I said, black girls don't really get the freedom to just be innocent kids, because we have society throwing us into ""grown woman"" status almost from the moment we are born. We get shamed for exploring our bodies and sexuality and we often get shamed instead of getting talked to about this stuff. And, yeah, I know that requires the adults in our lives to be progressive/knowledgeable enough to talk to us, so yeah, it's a whole issue. It still bugs me that one of my friends got her period months after we had sex ed, which her parents wouldn't let her attend, and this girl literally thought she was dying because her mom hadn't talked to her about her own body; she was not black, though, she was Laotian. 

And, then, we had the R. Kelly stans (pretty much just my mom) who were upset about what he was doing, but didn't think we should ""mess up"" his name when he's so talented. Like, how are we messing up his name when he's the one doing this stuff? I stopped listening to R. Kelly a long time ago, like around the ""chocolate factory"" days, when I really could understand what was going on. I don't care about someone's talent; dude was out there preying on young girls and, yes, I will also put blame on their parents/guardians, and the people around him, as well, because many of them knew what was going on and were so busy worrying about getting some money that they just let their daughters/these girls be fed to wolves."
1178,"No. And that's why I only associate with a few of my siblings and their kids.

The old heads in my family are completely dismissive of female victims of sexual abuse. I would give you some examples of the typical types of comments they make but there's no use, I'm sure you've heard them all. 

When you couple the fact that sexual abuse and rampant mysogyny has been at epidemic proportions for decades in Black communities with that ""Protect grown Black at all costs!"" mantra that most of us are all too familiar with, the result is disasterous.

Which is why I don't fuck with 90% of my family."
1179,"Yeah, the women in my family had similar reactions and issues and sort of dismiss each other‚Äôs and other people‚Äôs issues/reactions. It‚Äôs unsettling, but kind of interesting how knowing that they‚Äôre wrong doesn‚Äôt seem to totally invalidate their opinions."
1180,everything you said was FACTS!!
1181,"Your hair, your skin, your face -- all gorgeous! Also, I gotta know the story on that tee shirt."
1182,Le' Gorgeous
1183,So pretty!!
1184,Beautiful! üòç
1185,Love love love it!
1186,Natural beauty!
1187,"Very nice!  I wish more ladies went natural.  Natural is like personality and confidence,  its sexy."
1188,OMFG You are gorgeous and you hair is absolutely goals üòª
1189,We love to see it! üëè
1190,Beautiful
1191,Bellisima
1192,Where‚Äôd you get that shirt from ?
1193,Naturally beautiful! Love how even & clear your skin is. What's your skin care routine?
1194,Gorgeous üòçüòç
1195,Soooo pretty!
1196,"Stunning hair and face! Your curls look so healthy, I‚Äôm jealous! Also I‚Äôm glad we all are obsessed with your shirt? üòÇ"
1197,Confidence is beautiful.
1198,Love your beautiful hair and face. Lol
1199,We stan
1200,Gorgeous!
1201,Thank you! And also the shirt is actually a local brewery‚Äôs anniversary shirt design haha
1202,"It bothers me 1000% more when these comments come from other black women. I have 4c hair and wear protective styles 75% of the time (wigs/braids/faux locs/kinky twists). There are 2 black women in my department: one with 3b/3c hair who can easily do wash n gos, the other with relaxed hair. The amount of comments I have gotten from them throughout my tenure has been annoying to say the least. They honestly thought I was bald headed and made so many comments implying as such. Once they saw the thickness and length of my hair when pressed, those comments stopped. Now the comments have switched to how having it straight is more professional looking. I don't give two f*cks! I will wear my hair however I please!"
1203,"Ok, so if you watch the show 'my 600lb life' (I like TLC trash tv and that show motivates me to eat clean) a black female therapist called Lola Clay is frequently featured on the show.

She is really a beautiful woman who likes to wear lots of different hair styles (mostly wigs) and her makeup always looks flawless. 

The unnecessary hate comments she gets for her appearance really pisses me off-especially on the 600lb subreddit. Talking about how 'unprofessional' she looks. How 'annoying' her voice is and ALWAYS commenting on her hair and how horrible it is, etc. I suspect this woman has alopecia but still these comments are relentless and they even insinuate she is a whore and question her education. Ugh-anyway that's just the example that immediately came to mind with this topic."
1204,"I agree with everything you said. Also, you‚Äôre a great writer."
1205,"The numbers are exaggerated and a lot of accounts are obvious trolls, but there are women who are natural under the wigs who HATE their hair. It is not uncommon and it‚Äôs annoying see both sides bicker within the natural hair community. 

 Yes you have the extremists naturals who want to ban the weave trade, however you have women who claim to be a naturalist but wear weave 365 days of the year then come out with a blog, vlog, tweet about how they were insecure all along. 

Point is you‚Äôre not natural if you do everything in your power to create curls out of coils, hide your roots, texture, etc. Folks need to stop lumping that into being natural. And yes you can be natural wearing wigs/weave so don‚Äôt get it confused."
1206,[removed]
1207,"Omg sis, dafuq?!  I truly do not understand this mentality. Like what do they gain? As if there's some sort of up cookie points be doled out to who can be the most triffling... the fucking audacity. Let alone the unprofessionalism.

And I wouldn't be surprised if these same women have nothing but sugary words about non-Black co-worker's hair."
1208,Yo it‚Äôs always girl girls with 3c hair and up saying this stuff. I work with a girl like that and every time I ch age my hair it‚Äôs always a comment. I‚Äôve come to realize she uses me as a way to humble brag about her hair.
1209,"3b/3c sis just mad cause her passion twists be slippin out with the hair type, lol. Don‚Äôt let them persuade you in damaging a healthy, versatile head of hair. ‚Äî Signed, a 3b/3c sis."
1210,"Omg, I have thought about making a whole post about this, but thought it wouldn't be that interesting or not enough people watched for anyone to know what I was talking about. I used to look at that sub, but the unnecessary hate (not that surprising on Reddit, though) that Lola gets just turned me off. No matter what's going on in the episode, there is always, at least, one comment attacking her in some way, her hair, her clothing, how she looks, how she talks, if she's really qualified, etc. They talk about how she must not be as educated or as helpful as the other therapists on the show and I know it's racism because I watch it and see her clients express being happy with her and all. She's not doing anything more or less than the others on the show, so it's definitely down to racism. Then again, they usually are horrible about any non-black subjects of the show, too. It's disgusting that you literally always have some weird target on your back and judgement simply for being a black woman. I love how she looks; she's always professional and friendly. I guess it's because they're jealous/racist and can't stand to see this woman on a hit show, being in a position they think she shouldn't be in. Plus, I also don't think they like to see a feminine black woman; seeing as they are always harping on things that are usually considered feminine about her. Apparently, though, I've learned from the comments there, that her sister is also in the practice, which is amazing!"
1211,"Wow.

I've seen a few episodes and she quickly became my 2nd favorite (I like how Nazardin[?] don't play, he's my fav.) because she is so kind. She's also gentle-- which some of them really need because they've been through enough trauma, as well as really professional. I honestly never noticed her hair. 

People are shit sometimes. Shitty, shitty shit."
1212,I bet they also say she might have only gotten into school because of affirmative action.  That cheapens all of our successes.
1213,"Thank you, that really means a lot to me! I'm an author but my usual forte is erotica."
1214,Get the fuck up out of here
1215,"Honestly, both women are so insecure. They're always making comments to others about so and so's appearance. I don't have that kind of time to be critiquing other people's looks."
1216,"I've noticed that too. Like, they can't possibly imagine how different caring and styling for 4b/4c hair can be. Even made comments about my edges. I'm sorry but it would take an enormous amount of edge control to slick them down to create baby hairs I obviously do not have. Not to mention how those products dry my edges out."
1217,I hope you can report her. That is so messed up.  People don't realize the little petty stuff they are doing is not only unproffesional but borderline illegal. They shouldn't be able to harass somebody like that and keep their job.
1218,I didn't know she had a sister on the show too. That is pretty awesome.
1219,I don't know what happened but I'm certainly glad you caught it.
1220,"Unless their job is to critique people, that's just not productive at all.  

A relative of mine works at a wic office and instead of  helping others, all they do is gossip and critique other women. If my relative dresses a little too fancy they flocked to her business asking her who she is going out with and why she's dressed up.

 She has watched them gossip incessantly while their  desk phone rings until it stops. Her manager is an older Caribbean woman who is petty af and seems to take delight in office bullying.  She comments on extremely inappropriate things and speaks in a very demeaning manner. 

 She'll even go as far as disrupt important work just to send people (usually pretty women) on errands and busy work leaving them behind on their deadlines. I've told my relative that if she and everyone else in their office got together and all filed complaints in same week it might make a difference.

 The worst part is that every single time there is a White person in the office, she acts completely different and all of sudden this very professional. Even if that person is a subordinate."
1221,I honestly don‚Äôt know what makes them think it‚Äôs okay to do shit like that.
1222,I wish I could but I know it would not be worth it. She has a bit of mean girl energy to her and I don‚Äôt want to be caught in the cross fire. For now I just avoid her as my much as  possible.
1223,Racist troll that made many shitty comments that only the mods saw üòÅ
1224,"Imagine your life being so void of substance, joy and companionship that you're reduced to an insecure, greasy, Smeagle-like being toiling around in your own filth while you gaurd your imagined superiority; as it has become your one and only ""Precious"". 

On second thought, don't imagine that. It gave me chills just to write it."
