Because you like them."
1,"Can you clarify what you mean? If someone no longer wants to be with someone else, that's a perfectly valid reason."
2,His dick is too bomb.
3,"Solo parent, grateful for master‚Äôs degree"
4,‚ÄúWhat the hell am I doing?‚Äù
5,"At the moment:

Grateful, but a little quarantine-weary.

Overall:
Grateful mom, travels, sings, and dreams."
6,Full of love + love of fiction
7,Things always work out for me.
8,Life taught me to be kind.
9,I brought the gin and tonic.
10,Happily married mom of two girls
11,He also likes being alone. We're very content being alone together.
12,"1. Finding a partner who has similar alone-time preferences.
2. Finding a partner whose presence makes me feel peaceful and content when we are together so that our together-time recharges me as well as alone-time does."
13,Find someone you don't mind being around while still doing your own thing.  That person should also respect your space should you need to be physically alone at times too.
14,Compromise and respect when your SO needs to be alone :)
15,"He‚Äôs got his house, I‚Äôve got mine. We‚Äôll spend a night or at one or another‚Äôs (usually mine because I have pets) and that suits us both just fine."
16,"Find someone who has different interests than you... I like photography and my husband doesnt....so i go out to take pictures by myself and then my husband gets time at home alone....my husband is way more into fitness than i am so when hes at the gym, im at home alone etc..."
17,Seperate bedrooms
18,"Communicating your needs, and finding someone who respects them."
19,"Yep! We spend a lot of time physically near each other, but doing individual things (me reading, him playing a game; him watching tv, me on my phone, etc). It works great for us."
20,Had my confidence destroyed one too many times and in healing from that learned this important lesson. I am enough as I am and growing doesnt mean being the best.
21,"Unless you are Usain Bolt levels of good at something there is *always*  going to be somebody that is better at it than you are.    
So to me even worrying about it is a waste of time."
22,"I'm currently in the middle of figuring that out. I've realised that it's a huge limitation of myself. I don't try new things because I'm afraid to fail, but I'm also afraid to succeed. I feel like this anxiety is causing me harm."
23,"By improving in areas I could and coming to accept that I don't need to be *the* best, so long as I'm *my* best."
24,I'll let you know when I figure it out
25,This is me. It's still a lingering/go-to feeling I have but something that's helped is forcing myself to show up to things as my sub-optimal-self and watching what happens. The truth is not much because people give zero fucks.
26,"I'm struggling and failing at it now. 

It's been ingrained since I was baby that I had to be the best at everything I do. It was an expectation. I couldn't be in my family and not have this relentless drive to be the best, the drive to be successful. It's maddening and consumed much of my life. 

I don't think that drive and desire to ever be the best will ever go away, it makes me me. But I think how I can refocus it is focusing on being the best I can be, but not in comparison to others. I want to be the best at everything, but I want to beat a personal best of mine, or go beyond whatever previous limits I have. 

So instead of my natural fiery intensity being toxic and fucking with everyone, I can use it internally to be better than myself."
27,Getting depression and beeing bad at everything. Now I am happy to be average.
28,By maturing into understanding that no one is the best at all things. No one. Trying to be such is futile and a sign of insecurities within yourself that you need to work through.
29,I think a key element for me is to stop comparing myself to other people. Everyone has different qualities or a different learning curve. Telling me that I don‚Äôt have to have a consistency of being great at something due to my mood or tiredness or stress is a good way of not hating me when I feel like doing a terrible job at something I‚Äôm _usually_ good at. ‚ÄúI did the best of my ability today‚Äù is a great example of working to be kinder to oneself.
30,"By accepting that I'm undateable, ugly trash that is good at nothing. In a way, it took the pressure off."
31,By realizing that the only thing I need to work on is becoming the best version of myself *for* myself.
32,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - there are tools to teach your brain how to think ""better""."
33,I am super competitive so have never have & don't see it as a bad thing bc of my achievements
34,I had Pica before and during my pregnancy. I ate sheets of paper.
35,Chocolate milk! It doesn't sound weird but I normally hate chocolate and I am lactose intolerant. I drank it every day and never got sick. Such weird times.
36,"Not a ‚Äòweird‚Äô thing, but I absolutely HAD to have a chocolate every single day during my first pregnancy. It went away after I had the baby, although I still love chocolate!"
37,"Filet o Fish sandwiches from McDonalds. I worked at Red Lobster during my second pregnancy, and I would stop and get a shitty fish sandwich before going to work."
38,"Considering I didn't much care for milk before or after pregnancy I thought it was a bit weird that I started going through a gallon of 2% milk every couple days.

Also, McDonald's french fries. Unsalted. They had to be McDonald's, no other fries would do. I still love them."
39,"Pizza with pepperoncinis on it, washed down with grape soda. I cannot stand grape soda. But I drank the crap out of it when I was pregnant."
40,"Not me, but my mom craved chalk, and she still likes to eat chalk. Once she switched my lactaid pills to a brand that tasted chalky specifically because she thought I would like those better. I did not."
41,"Not really weird things, but I ate a LOT of watermelon and otter pops. I hardly eat them anymore. But on the bright side, they helped keep me hydrated during my pregnancy."
42,"Ice. I would constantly crave chewing on ice. Super weird, sign of low iron levels, but even on double the normal dose of iron supplements, I would still crave ice. Currently pregnant with baby #2, so it'll be interesting to see what I crave this time around!"
43,"Interesting, was it like one sheet a day or just a few sheets here and there?"
44,üòÇ one of my closest friends also is lactose intolerant and pregnant but she eats all the ice cream she can get but it doesn‚Äôt bother her. So weird.
45,I fricken love chocolate!!
46,Sometimes I'd eat 10.
47,I definitely abused the heck out of that pregnancy superpower haha I did icecream too! I'd be lying if I said I didn't consider getting pregnant again just to be able to enjoy milk treats haha
48,Damn. Did doctors tell you that you needed to stop?
49,üòÇüòÇ
50,"It wasn't toxic, but it was a major indicator that I had severe anemia."
51,"Oh wow. That‚Äôs actually me right now, I‚Äôm anemic and I would eat a lot of ice. My teeth would hurt but I didn‚Äôt care, all I wanted was ice. And I would chew on a lot of plastic, I didn‚Äôt swallow them but I kind of wanted to."
52,Get your blood checked ASAP. I ended up needing a double blood transfusion.
53,"I went to a doctor last week, I‚Äôm taking iron supplements at the moment. I‚Äôm not pregnant when my mother was, she was anemic and it really took a toll on her with all 3 pregnancies."
54,Lucky. I had to go through 2 blood transfusions and 8 week iron infusions.
55,"Oh damn, I‚Äôm sorry."

57,"I think it comes down to trust. Whether you like your body or not, this person has chosen to be with you. They've (hopefully) told you they love your body (if they haven't, you need to have a conversation about it). You trust everything else they say, why not trust this too? 

And no one else's opinion matters. They aren't in your relationship, so don't let it affect your relationship. Their opinion is irrelevant."
58,"I sometimes feel funny walking around public places with my boyfriend. I see a lot of girls looking in his direction, he's the typically attractive, lean, tan, tall with dark hair but blue eyes type while I'm a little chubby with a head for radio haha. Somehow simultaneously it makes me feel good in these situations because I remember he's there with me and chooses to be over and over heh."
59,"My partner is one of the leanest people I‚Äôve ever seen while I am overweight. I notice how sometimes he‚Äôs insecure about his weight just as I am of mine. When I look at him, I could almost drool I think his body is so beautiful and sexy. Which makes me think, If he‚Äôs insecure yet I think he‚Äôs perfect looking then it might also go the other way. 

I love to run my hands on his slim tummy while he prefers to squeeze my curves."
60,"I‚Äôm gonna be real, I don‚Äôt love admitting this but at one point I had a good 80 pounds on my SO. He never made me feel unwanted or unloved. Quite the opposite. He knew I was bigger when we started talking and he never seemed to mind much *but* I cared that he couldn‚Äôt pick me up, I cared that I couldn‚Äôt sit in his lap without him not being able to breathe correctly, I cared that when we were out people would sometimes treat me like I was invisible when they were interacting with my SO. I would constantly worry about how people perceived me when I was with him b/c I was so much bigger than him. 

None of those separately were the reason that I committed to a huge lifestyle change. That happened to be a negative plane experience. But regardless I‚Äôm down 74 pounds so far and don‚Äôt feel so self conscious about the amount of space I take up. I know I look better and I feel amazing. 

The day is fast approaching that I will weigh less than my SO and I can‚Äôt wait. That‚Äôs always been my benchmark for feeling okay with him picking me up."
61,I worry about this often. I have a one year old child and haven't bounced back from having him. I feel so much frumpier and uglier than before I got pregnant. I often find myself thinking other women probably wonder why he's with me. I haven't found a way to deal with it but I have started working out and taking care of myself.
62,Nope. I'm 6'4 and he's 5'10. Naturally there's a weight difference and we're both still height/weight proportional. Strangers make their jokes and we laugh back. There's honestly nothing to deal with. He's happy with my long long legs and I'm happy with every inch of him from foot to head. ‚ù§Ô∏è
63,"I'm actually only 10 lbs heavier than my partner, but by looking at us, you'd never know that lol His is all lean muscle while mine is boobs, ass, and tummy. üòÖ I'm curvy, but he loves it.

I do get self conscious at times, but he's very reassuring and very sweet. It just comes down to trust and self-love. You gotta love what you have, if not, know you have the power to change things. 

Either way, don't sweat it, they've chosen to be with YOU, you know?"
64,"This question brought tears to my eyes. I'm heavier than my partner by about 20 kgs. He's also a very slim build whereas I've always been curvy. He recently told me that he's less attracted to me since I gained a bit more weight and it's been a burden ever since. I've always had the thought in the back of my head of whether it makes a difference to him, I guess it does. No one else has ever brought it up.

He's not a bad guy, he just doesn't know how to communicate. I'm trying to lose weight now but for health reasons, not just for him. Sorry about the long answer, I needed to get this off my chest."
65,"I do worry - my ex wad also leaner than me and he pointed out when we were breaking up that he no longer found me attractive because I was too fat. So I guess even if I want to trust my now boyfriend, it's a bit difficult to feel sexy sometimes.

I just sort of pretend it's not there, like with most of my problems (I know, a highly healthy mindset)"
66,"My boyfriend is smokin hot.. he competes in national jujitsu completions so he‚Äôs in excellent shape - he doesn‚Äôt just have a 6 pack.. he has an 8-pack, he‚Äôs also super tall, and really distinctive (heavily tattooed, long hair, bearded etc) He‚Äôs also five years younger than me. I, on the other hand, am a 40 year old, very overweight, single mother. It would be super easy for me to obsess about how we look together, or what people think, but truthfully I don‚Äôt give a fuck. They can think whatever they want, he‚Äôs snuggling down in MY bed at the end of the day and that‚Äôs all that matters.. besides, he has made it PERFECTLY clear that he‚Äôs thinks my size is sexy as fuck and thats the only validation I need."
67,I deal with this now. My partner is 161 pounds and keeps losing weight and I‚Äôm the heaviest I‚Äôve been in my life 220. I‚Äôve never been big until i got depression my junior year in high school and even then i wasn‚Äôt big but i am now. I‚Äôm uncomfortable with myself and i feel like he looks at other girls all the time bc i am not cute.
68,"Weirdly I was with my ex husband for 10 years. Most of that I was very overweight and he is tiny. I never once felt weird or off. He just made me feel at ease in my own skin. Never once made me feel bad about it, so in public I just didn‚Äôt care. 

Then I lost a crap ton of weight started dating a new guy who is bigger than me now, though I‚Äôm still plus sized and I feel larger now than I ever did because of the way he treated me about it. I was just never at ease around him with my body. Always feeling the need to be tighter or better or younger. He was not good in the compliments department. Haha
My point is the way I felt about my body had nothing to do with how I actually looked and how my partner perceived me regardless of my size."
69,We are both healthy weights and similar heights but I am around 6 kilos heavier than him. I don't think the difference is big enough that strangers could tell but it does make me a little self conscious.
70,"When my boyfriend and I got to know each other, we were both changing lifestyles in order to be healthier / fitter. I started IF and counting calories, while he started lifting. 

His body looks goddamn amazing, muscular and strong and I sometimes beat myself up for not looking as good as him (I have a healthy weight now but still have a tummy and wide hips). 

But I know he loves me, and he compliments me or encourages me with how good I keep up with the lifestyle changes. He gives advice and always listens to me, even when I'm just ranting about stupid things. And this goes both ways! I also listen to him, even if it's about weightlifting stuff I don't fully understand. 

I think it comes down to mutual respect and understanding for each other to eliminate negativity. It is not a competition, him versus me. It's a team effort. Support each other in whatever way possible. And that really helps."
71,Usually it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all but sometimes if I‚Äôm feeling a bit sensitive it makes me self conscious and I find it hard to enjoy our sex life. Sometimes when we‚Äôre out and about I think people must think that I eat all his food or that he‚Äôs a feeder lol. Doesn‚Äôt usually bother me but it‚Äôs always in the back of my mind! I‚Äôm also only a couple of pounds heavier than him but he‚Äôs 5‚Äô11 and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 so the extra pounds make a bit of a difference. Also... it kills me that his hoodies are too small for me! He says it doesn‚Äôt bother him and that he doesn‚Äôt like skinny girls but I don‚Äôt believe him.
72,I've always been attracted to talk skinny guys and for some reason they've been attracted to my much curvier frame. As long as I think they are sexy AF and they make it known they they also think that I am sexy as hell too then we all good :). I do sometimes get worried/anxious about feeling like I may be  squashing if I'm on top but most times I just get shown how much stronger he actually is than I am and that he can take it and loves it then it isn't a problem.

74,"I hate my belly, but still like my body even though I think I'm actually technically obese now, and I would like to be smaller. He hates being ~~skinny~~ thin (he hates the word skinny üò©) but still likes his body. We both make sure the other feels attractive through compliments, flirting, physical touch. 

I don't really worry about how strangers view us but I also think I would've noticed if anyone looked at us weird. I don't look as obese as I am. I have thighs butt and boobs and strategic hiding but even without the belly restraints, I think no one would make a big deal out of it. I think beauty standards and what not are a lil different I'm the black community."
75,"sorry I don‚Äôt have a feel good answer but I have to be honest, it‚Äôs a major insecurity for me. I have never felt loved and desired by a partner in the physical sense. I feel I‚Äôve always been settled for. With my last partner of years, while we had sex regularly, I always knew in the back of mind that he preferred other women‚Äôs bodies. And he did not want his bosses, etc. to see me. Im happy for fellow fat girls who have found someone that desires them, but for me the only thing that helps is weight loss."
76,"I‚Äôve always been heavier than my partners up until now. Fit/Athletic/Average sized men seem to gravitate towards me. 
I weighed more than my SO when I met him, then lost 80+lbs in our 4th year together. I‚Äôm still a BBW though. 

Admittedly, I am an hourglass shape and men have explicitly said, that my shape ‚Äúcancels out‚Äù my fatness (silly I know).

I only started feeling a type of way when I overheard comments made by people who find it weird that a man could be attracted to bigger women. I think society still takes issue with bigger women being sexually desired, so when they see a relatively fit man, hand in hand with a short, chunky woman like me, it baffles them. Stereotypes about men being desperate and below-par if they have a heavy set girlfriend made me feel insecure and I internalised that. Fortunately, none of my partners (other than one) made me feel less desirable because I‚Äôm bigger."
77,Nah my partner looooves my fat ass and big thighs.  As for strangers they can suck an egg.
78,"I was insecure about it for a really long time, and if I'm being completely honest with myself, I still am. 

My partner is very fit, been a gym fanatic since he was a teen, and takes a lot of pride in looking a certain way (to the point where the muscle loss from not being able to gym during lockdown is really having a mental impact). 

On the other hand, I've always been quite 'soft', and my body weight fluctuates like crazy from a long history of a poor relationship with food. I've been overweight from binge eating, and underweight from not eating following a bereavement. At the minute I'm neither - I'm at a healthy weight, but with a bit of a tummy (which is where all my fat goes, to the point where people ask if I'm pregnant...)

I always thought of myself as not good enough for him, because I thought he was so much more attractive than me. Struggled with it for such a long time, but it's slowly got better as our relationship developed. We've been together for over 10 years now, and I came to realise that a lot of what I thought were issues because of my body type were actually issues because of my insecurity. The more I focussed on myself for ME, rather than for US, the more I've come to realise that he has just as many body hang ups as me. He's worried about his shoulders to being big enough, while I'm worried about my face being chubby. He's worried that his abs aren't well defined, whilst I'm worried that my tummy sags when I lie on my side.

The only difference is that my body issues are accepted, and even expected, by society. His aren't. We both have things we want to change, we both have things we're self conscious about. But none of those things we see as flaws in the other person. I don't care if he's huge and jacked or skinny and small, in the same way that he doesn't care if my tummy is flat or my butt is perky. We love each for who we are, in bodies that are changing constantly anyway."
79,"not really. he grew up as/has been an extremely skinny guy, so he's not society's ''ideal'' either. i figured if he totally does it for me (skin over bones has always been my type), it's not outlandish that plump women do it for him.

no one has ever said a word. it might be different if i were very obese (i'm ''only'' overweight)."
80,"I am now heavier than my SO. For the first half (or more) of our relationship I was probably 20lbs over my comfortable weight (and he was at least 50 lbs more than me, mostly muscle). But I was strong and healthy.
Unfortunately I had some severe health problems and now I find myself at least  50lbs above what he weighs. Being disabled makes it worse. I was always very active, but I can no longer get around. I was going to start physical therapy, but then COVID-19 hit and I can't go. 
 He tells me that he doesn't care & that he's always going to find me attractive. And that he loves me regardless.  But I was always very into looking sexy and fit to him AND myself.  I can't understand how he can still find me attractive. But he does and I am grateful."
81,I have fluctuated over the years but I was the heaviest I ever have been when we first met and my partner thought I was the sexiest thing ever. Which helped! It never really occurred to me what people thought - they never said anything so what does it matter? In fact for the most part they were probably too interested in themselves to notice us. It's worth trying to adopt that mindset if you can.
82,"My last boyfriend was 140-145 lbs at 6' and talked about wanting to lose weight every time he got up to 145. I weigh between 130-135 at 5'3"" and while a lot of it is muscle because I'm strong and a runner too, I still have an hourglass figure. I always felt fat and ugly and unattractive to him and it turned out I was right: he admitted that he hadn't been attracted to me, his mom said I was ""too athletic"" for his usual type, etc. In hindsight, I see lots of little actions that I was subconsciously picking up on, like him always turning the light off for sex, literally never once calling me pretty and only a couple times complimenting me at all without me asking for one, slightly pulling away in the couple pictures we took together, not holding my hand or otherwise being affectionate in public.

In contrast, I'm dating an almost equally skinny guy now, and remembered that I had dated a couple very skinny guys when I was younger and heavier/not in shape and never had any self-esteem issues. Their actions have all been consistently admiring and appreciative.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that if your partner isn't showing that they find you attractive, then it'll be an issue that nothing can overcome. If they are, then any doubts come from within and it's worth working on."
83,Literally constantly and not well.
84,"I'm like 15 lbs heavier than my bf.
He is taller and I'm curvy so obviously a big butt and boobs will make me weigh more"
85,"I am much heavier than my husband, alias I have always been heavier than all the men with whom I related, excluding one. I always thought, since my teens(i'm 54 now) that if someone is willing to have sex with me, ob be in a relationship for that matter, it's because they want me, with my weight, my heart, my mind and everything else that comes with the package that's me. So why worry? Enjoy. And about the others, they don't pay my rent, like we said here in Brasil, so i don't care what they think."
86,[removed]
87,I used to when we first started seeing each other  but he has taught me to see how beautiful he finds me and that has led me to become very comfortable in my own skin. I've never really cared out other peoples opinions only my own or my partners.
88,"It‚Äôs all about picking the right partner.  When I met my husband we were two sporty hotties, him being slightly universally hot and me being a matter of taste.  I assumed he would be like the typical superficial good looking douches but he‚Äôs not at all. A few things clued me in that he was a good pick: 
1) he never talked about looks or bodies. He always talked about people‚Äôs personalities. He never put emphasis on how I looked when I was normal weight - he only talked about how smart I was or my big eyes. When I would get myself done up to go out vs no makeup, shitty hair and grunge clothes, it was like he never even noticed. 
2) he is smart, as in book smart, a brilliant engineer. And street smart. I knew a guy that was that smart would also be aware that as I aged, I would get wrinklier and possibly fatter, esp after kids. His biggest fear was not having a life long partner as a senior citizen, and he‚Äôs too smart to self sabotage that. 

As for how other people perceive us, meh. I think most people see how he looks at me and loves me, and don‚Äôt think ‚Äúhow can he love that lumpy old bag‚Äù, I think they probably think ‚ÄúI would like to find someone who looks at me like that‚Äù.

I honestly just give myself a lot of credit for choosing well. He‚Äôs always been way more interested in his nerdy engineering stuff than he has for hot bodies - the only thing he ever wanted was someone to do sports and science with. And that has always been obvious to anyone who‚Äôs ever met him. Nobody even attempts to hit on him, he just automatically sends that message that he‚Äôs closed for business when it comes to other women."
89,"I've been with my boyfriend for almost three years and although he never said or acted like he hates my body much rather the contrary I fucking swear he hates it, even tho he said my body type is the exact one he likes, I'm convinced that he thinks my body is ugly... Do I have self-esteem problems? Yes? Obviously? Of course?"
90,"On partner, no, I use very honest photos on my dating profiles and I‚Äôve never shocked a man yet so I know they are down with (extra) thickness. 

On strangers, yet another astounding no. Why should I care what society thinks about me? The average person in my part of the woods is a religious nut who beats their children and can‚Äôt formulate a proper sentence. My obesity should be the least of their concerns and if it‚Äôs not I‚Äôll just tell them to go get a full set of teeth before speaking to me."
91,"I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1‚Äù and about 180lbs, he‚Äôs about 5‚Äô7‚Äù has a little bit of a beer belly but he‚Äôs a carpenter and pretty strong. However, it‚Äôs not really about that. He‚Äôs never treated me or said anything that made me feel anything outside of absolutely beautiful. 
My ex of 11yrs did, I wasn‚Äôt comfortable naked with my ex because of comments he made while angry. 
The way a person values you is what means the most üíû"
92,"My husband is super fit and super hot. I dislocated my knee last year and due to lack of insurance it took a long time for me to get back on my feet. I'm 50lbs over weight and he makes me feel like the most gorgeous goddess on the planet. Seriously he's amazing. I struggle with how I look in photos because I'm not used to looking like this, but none of my insecurities come from what he thinks about the way I look."
93,"Men, like women, know what they like... and despite what Instagram and Facebook and conventional media tell us, all sorts of men like all sorts of bodies. I‚Äôm a heavy girl and have learned not to question it when someone finds me attractive. He knows what he likes and what he likes is me. Own that, and thrive in it! Because nothing is more attractive than confidence."
94," I mean I'm fat, not ugly lol. I'm 5'3 and tbh, because I'm on the heavier side, the guys that tend to be okay with dating me aren't on the short side so  I'm not really heavier than my partner. But, I am heavy set.

I don't worry about how attractive they perceive me because I'm not insecure - if you're pursuing me and you're dating me, I'm not worried about whether or not you think I'm attractive. I know you think I'm attractive.

So with that being said, there is no ""dealing with it""."
95,"My last boyfriend was less than 10% body fat and 25lb lighter than me. My looks had 0 effect on the relationship, IMO I was the hotter one still :p"
96,"I am heavier than my bf, but I am also heavier than most people. üòÅ I don't worry one bit. If he didn't find me attractive he wouldn't be in an relationship with me."
97,"im 130 and my bf is 89, its a struggle"
98,[removed]
99,"My partner is very tall and lean, I‚Äôm tall myself but thicc. My weight has always been something I‚Äôve felt self conscious about. When we first started dating I was thrown for a loop at how physically affectionate and affirming my partner is. He loves just grabbing and squeezing me, and anytime I call him he answers with ‚Äúhello gorgeous‚Äù
It‚Äôs all pretty cheesy, but it‚Äôs also wonderful. I don‚Äôt ever really find myself worrying about other women or how we look together because we‚Äôve both have made a daily effort to make each other feel deeply loved and cared for. I‚Äôve never dated someone before than made me feel like this before. Of course I have my days where I feel gross or frumpy, but that‚Äôs more of a reflection of how I am feeling about myself, not about how the world or my partner views me."
100,I do feel weird sometimes. But my SO makes it known that he loves me for me... And it brings.me back to comfort.
101,"I was much heavier than my boyfriend when I was a teenager, think about double his weight. He didn't care, thought the world of me. No-one else seemed to have anything to say about it either. But it was ultimately one of the things that led to me ending the relationship. Silly, I know. But I couldn't get over the way I felt when standing next to him. He was what you would consider underweight, so I just thought we looked ridiculous. 
My now husband and I sort of waiver between 5-10 kilos of one another. Currently 41 weeks pregnant, I'm about 15kg heavier than he is (I've gained about 7kgs in pregnancy). Our weight has never been an issue, sometimes the cause of a bit of jealousy over who can hit a certain weight loss goal first but we both find each other incredibly attractive and make sure we remind one another every single day.  
When you find the right person for you, literally nothing in the world matters more than your love for each other and making sure you express it."
102,"I‚Äôm a martial arts teacher and I love going to the gym and exercise, but my body is a mess and I keep getting and loosing weight all the time. I recently moved to a new country and the new food, the stress and the time it took me to start in a new gym made me gain extra weight and it‚Äôs always a complicated topic for me..
My boyfriend is not super fit but it‚Äôs easier for him to keep an stable weight..
I started in January a really restrictive diet but with the quarantine, lack of aliments and all day home, I‚Äôm cooking extra and I‚Äôm also eating extra so I had to stop it and it‚Äôs making me feel a bit down. I still train as much as I can but that‚Äôs not enough.
My BF has always showed me support, but I know it‚Äôs my own demons.. it‚Äôs complicated because I know I‚Äôm healthy and I‚Äôm ‚Äúfit‚Äù but I don‚Äôt look like and people can‚Äôt believe I am, but that‚Äôs what it should matter, what I am and how I deal with it.
I said nothing but I honestly needed to express that, sorry."
103,"I do worry, especially since I know he's been with other more beautiful women before we got together. I'm always insecure about it, but mostly keep about it to myself. At first, I would jokingly ask if he found me attractive at all and he said looks don't matter. If he were to really answer that, though, I'd say he doesn't find me the least bit attractive. I tried so many ways to ask him if I look okay or pretty (or stuff like that) but it's all just ""meh"".

Also, during the beginning of our relationship he would make remarks about how I should lose weight because his peers/relatives would comment about how big I was. Didn't really care about what other people think about me. I don't have any problems with his family, they're a wonderful bunch who treat me like one of their own. 

After a while, his friends/relatives just accepted me as I was and didn't say anything more (at least not to my knowledge)."
104,"I‚Äôm a fairly average-sized, average height woman but last year I dated a guy who was unbelievably thin and looked really young and I struggled with it a bit. I felt like when we were walking down the street holding hands people were looking at us wondering why I was dating a child. And some of my friends made comments.

It wasn‚Äôt his fault but I do think it was a big part of why we split up and I wish I could have been less self conscious"
105,"Not heavier, but I definitely have more fat. I never felt like he wasn't attracted to me, he makes it obvious that he's been more attracted to me after I gained some weight. He likes the fat butt/thighs and curves. With strangers it has kind of been like that, too. I had lost a lot of weight and noticed that I started to get more attention/hit on when I gained some of it back. 

Me feeling self conscious about my weight is about my own perception, I do feel like I looked better when my body was at a healthier weight. I think part of the reason why I haven't been as serious about losing weight again is because I think about his reaction."
106,[removed]
107,"My partner and I weigh the exact same, but he's a foot taller than me. People notice and comment that I'm fat, and I suppose it does bother me.

I've been using it as motivation to lose weight, but I don't think anyone else should do that. I know it's unhealthy, but I just want the comments to stop."
108,[removed]
109,"We've both had all kinds of weights (not medically dangerous ones, in case it matters). It doesn't seem people care and I don't care if I weigh more or less than him."
110,"My boyfriend is 6'1 with a lean upperbody and super muscular ass and legs, which.. god.. I die, so hot.. He's really confident in his own skin. 

Meanwhile I'm 5'4 and about 20 kg more than I should be. I feel super insecure about myself. In the beginning of our relationship, I insisted we had sex in the dark and I'd cover myself up and run to the bathroom to get dressed. Now, it's not a problem. I walk around naked in front of him. He makes me feel so beautiful and loved. He always kisses me all over. Not a part of my body he hasn't kissed when he's in range.. Even my foot if we are on the sofa and I have my feet on him. He tells me every day how much he loves me and my body. And how beautiful he finds me. 

Personally I think it goes way beyond the physical. I truly believe he just loves ME as a person. Which means all of me. I'm pretty lucky tbh. He's the best"
111,"My partner is conventionally attractive and I am so-so.  I don't really think much about it, because I didn't realize he was THAT attractive to other people, I only got really hot for him when feelings kicked in. But we do notice people looking at us sometimes,  but usually think it's because they are not used to seeing an interracial couple (we live in a very white city/ town). 
It bugs me a little that he's hit on often, I do trust him completely and he gets a little annoyed with it happening. I used to think it was funny but honestly it's gotten annoying for me too. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
112,[removed]
113,"My partner expresses his attraction to me daily, so there is no issue there. As for others? If they judge me by my size rather than how happy I make him, they can just piss off."
114,Oh thats a constant worry but there's just certain things I think about. For one my recent partner picked me up Bridal style and I was completely confused he wasn't tense or struggling or anything and when I asked he said I weighed nothing so that's something I think about if I feel concerned. Also just trying my best to stay positive and look after my health is a big thing since I've always struggled with weight (and the bullying that came with it) so it's something I try my best to change not for them but for me. So that I feel good about myself üòä
115,"I'm much heavier then my partner, I'm 5""5 and size 16, or 42-44 in European size and my boyfriend is tall (6') and VERY lean. When we met for our first date i liked how he looked but was afraid he would think i was too fat. Boy was i wrong, we fell head over heels for each other and he apparently loves my curves and everything about my body. I'm an American so my whole life i was made to feel not thin enough by everything and everyone around me, so i never thought i would be able to have a thin person love me because i was too fat. And nothing against chubby boys, but my type has always been tall and lean, my celebrity crushes were on people like Tom Hiddleston, Benedict Cumberbatch, Keanu Reeves, ect. I love his slim hips, firm tummy, and lean arms, and he loves my soft tummy and, thick hips. In the beginning of tbe relationship i did feel pretty self conscious about my body, but after a few months he made me feel more confident by just being crazy for my body. It makes me feel better that he is able to pick me up and can man handle me a bit :)."
116,"My boyfriend grabs my ass or titties and just knead them, especially when I'm on top having sex, and makes appreciative noises. Sure, I feel insecure but he always assures me he loves my body."
117,"I've been obese my entire life and as an whole have dated mostly average sized people (men and women). One of the things you realize is that there are a few different types of partner. 

Partner one is not normally attracted to fat people, but is dating you in spite of that. They are the type that is almost embarrassed of you and will often not bring you around their friends or family. Or has to offer an explanation for you. Regardless of how much you like this person, the expectation is that you will change for them because they see this part of you as fundamentally wrong. Even if you want and intend on losing weight, these relationships are damaging and really not worth it. 

Partner two has no preference either way. They have dated big girls and small girls and tall girls and short girls. They just like you for you regardless of your size. These people are legit. 

Partner three is the golden partner. They prefer bigger women and find your curves and softness sexy. They love and appreciate your body and make you feel amazing and sexy. They are wouldn't care if you lost weight and got fit, because they truly love you. 

Partner four is the fetish partner. They fetishize your size and often encourage you to gain more weight. You are sexy to them because you are fat, and would lose that sexiness if you lost weight. If you also fetishize fatness and want to gain more, and/or be in a ""feeder"" relationship then this is fine. But if you do not enjoy this type of relationship, please do not engage in one. This can also be damaging, because, similar to partner one, your weight becomes a primary focus in your relationship. 

I've dated all four of these people. Unfortunately, it's often difficult to decipher who is who, but pay attention to the way they treat you in public, the way they treat your body during sex, etc. And you can usually figure it out. Also, as a disclaimer, I have zero issue with people who are not attracted to fat women. Everyone is entitled to a preference and if the only reason you don't want to date me is because I'm fat then that's fine, just let me know so I don't waste my time. And don't be cruel about it."
118,"I assume someone is with me because they want to be, and the opinions of strangers has nothing to do with me. When I feel insecure, I remind myself of these facts."
119,"I'm currently losing weight and weigh 70lbs more than her (used to be more like 95lbs). I'm four inches taller, overweight, and working on it. 

We both struggled with an eating disorder up until about a year ago, and if I relapse I get very upset about the weight difference between us and believe there is no way she's attracted to me. I was almost twice her size, it killed me! But I've been good for sometime now and I feel very secure that she's attracted to me and it helps that she's very affectionate and touchy. 

I used to worry A LOT about how people view us, and I still do, but no where near as much. I used to get really caught up thinking stuff like, ""Which part are people going to notice first, huh? That we're lesbians? That we're an interracial couple? No, they're probably going to think I'm not good enough for her cause I'm fat."" I still believe it's true, I just don't care as much what people think of us. 

I deal with it by actively working on the negative thoughts. When they come up I counter them, when I need reassurance I talk to her, and I work on blocking out other people. It's hard, I still work on it daily, but it's gotten so much better."
120,"After having 2 kids my belly is ruined. After the first was born I lost weight well but after the second I haven‚Äôt had the drive to lose weight and I‚Äôm the heaviest I‚Äôve ever been. I‚Äôm currently dealing with PPD so that doesn‚Äôt help. But no matter what my husband loves me for me even if I‚Äôm a little chubby right now. He always makes sure to tell me I‚Äôm beautiful no matter what, he says we have 2 amazing children and that matters more than appearance. 

I deal by not letting it get to me... I know easier said then done.... it is super hard sometimes but if you don‚Äôt love yourself for who you are you will never be happy. Even if it‚Äôs temporary love yourself and your body and the people around you will love you and your body."
121,[removed]
122,All the time. I get that everyone has a type and luckily my boyfriend prefers thicker girls. My type is tall and skinny so I guess I ask for the weight difference by who I find attractive. He never makes me feel like I need to lose weight but he is also supportive when I want to lose weight. My weight is not something I ever think about when I'm with him but when we are apart I think about it a lot. as far as dealing with it....I don't. I internalize and silently suffer.
123,I would be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt pop up in my brain every once in awhile. I have always been bigger than him and that‚Äôs not going to change. He has told me that he loves all of me and I love all of him. I have never cared what other people thought about me or us. We are different races as well. I also have tattoos and he doesn‚Äôt. So there are a few different reasons why people would stare but we don‚Äôt pay anyone any attention because we are to busy spending time together.
124,"I‚Äôm heavier than my partner - he‚Äôs probably 125 soaking wet. This is my first time dating someone thinner than I am and at first it didn‚Äôt bother me. When I started gaining weight is when I got self conscious. He sometimes passes comments about heavy people and his disgust of them. We went through a dry spell when I changed jobs and was constantly stressed because I hated my new job. We talked about it, though, and he reassured me. Now I‚Äôve gained some more weight and I‚Äôm not comfortable with myself. Our sex life is slowing down and I‚Äôm paranoid that it‚Äôs because of my weight. So in short, I‚Äôm not dealing with it very well at all. I‚Äôm basically waiting for the day he tells me I‚Äôm too big."
125,My husband is very fit and good looking. I'm working on my weight (down 25lbs!) But he is always making comments about my weight that are not the nicest. I'm working hard but I work full time at an office and 2 small kids it's hard to find time to workout. But he works from home and works out hours a day and can't understand why I can't workout too.
126,"I am just heavier than my boyfriend but he is almost a foot taller then me (25cm) 

I was super insecure when we got together but today while squeezing my belly into funny shapes (ft funny noises) he said he was jealous of me for having a belly that can be funny while his is just flat

This meant a lot because I have never EVER though as my body as ""fun"" of anything like that, I've struggled with eating disorders for years,I was unhealthy thin and desperately unhappy,

Something about having my body seen as more than my linear idea of good and bad made me notice that my body is kinda cool

Sorry for grammar/rambling
I'm drunk xoxo"
127,[removed]
128,"I am heavier than who I am currently dating - he's quite fit and has a slight frame.

I don't worry about him finding me attractive because he wouldn't be asking me out if he thought I wasn't attractive. And the strangers? I don't care. I've been bullied about my weight my whole life, so I'm at the point where I will either not notice or shrug and move on.

You have to come to a point in your mind when you just.... Let it go. People's perception is something they come up with and it is not on me to please them."
129,"I don't worry about how attractive my partner finds me because he compliments me throughout the day, every day, reassuring me that I'm the sexiest woman he's seen. 
I actually didn't realize we would have such a difference in weight until we met in person. I consider myself thick because I don't really have rolls, I'm just solid. He is extremely thin and narrow. I asked him what he thought about me the first time we met and he said ""she's beautiful, tall. She's perfect."" 
We've only gone out in public a few times (we just started seeing each other a few weeks before the quarantine) and I haven't noticed any weird looks or anything, because I'm too focused on having a good time with my man."
130,"I worry very often, I get particularly sad with it because people usually assume we are brothers or jus friends...even though he says he love me, chooses me, love my body...I still hate my body and avoid going out..."
131,"Short answer: yes. But that is mostly due to me insecurities that were made worse by my ex. 

I am taller, older, and heavier than my boyfriend. Needless to say, we are not a traditional couple. He has always maintained that none of that has ever bothered him. We met online through some mutual friends and I was very nervous to meet him in person. When I asked him if he was nervous to meet me for the first time, he said "" No, I already knew you were the kind of person I wanted to be with."" 

I do think about how people perceive us but I try not to let it bother me. When we are out and about I have never had any bad reactions with ""the public"". One thing that bothers me in public: my boyfriend is very much a home body and is not very comfortable when we are at a sit down restaurant (also he is not very expressive, so he always had a neutral/disinterested expression on his face). Sometimes this discomfort shows through and I am afraid people will think he isnt into me because of his expressions. 

One thing that helps me deal with it, is remembering that he has insecurities too and that sometimes my insecurities hurt him too."
132,"I love that most of the women in this thread have positive stories! Like many others, I have always been heavier than my partner. When we were younger he was very skinny, around 130lbs, and I sat around 160 for most of my life. After we got married and I took on a very stressful job, I gained about 100lbs in 4 years and have been struggling to lose it. 

He says he is still attracted to me, but we no longer have any physical intimacy and the past couple of times we've tried, it has not gone well. I think it has also put a rift in our relationship overall as we aren't really that close or romantic anymore. We work together on the day to day chores and other adult responsibilities but our marriage is a pretty distant and unhealthy one. He definitely cares about me (shown in other ways), but the weight issue has taken a toll for sure and it is on my mind constantly. 

There hasn't really been a way to deal with it. I am very depressed and anxious, I don't like to leave the house often so I don't receive judgment from others. It's rough for sure. I am always ""trying"" to lose it but as a grad student now with virtually no free time and struggling with a binge eating disorder, it's been a challenge. Not to be a Debbie Downer, but I thought I'd share one of the not so awesome versions of this story, lol."
133,"I'm not necessarily heavier than my husband, but I am significantly less attractive. He is heavier than me, but he carries himself well and has muscle. His little bit of beer belly doesn't show through his t shirt. Mine does!! Also, since my first pregnancy, I have had horrible adult acne (never had problems with acne as a teen/when we met). My hair isn't shiny and pretty, and is dull and currently cut very short (send fast-growth vibes my way!). I have the beginnings of a hunch back starting (my head sits very far forward) because of years of bad posture and joint problems. 



My husband is in far better shape and continues to get more handsome! He is going gray, but it's so handsome in his dark, thick hair. He has dark lashes and full facial hair, with bright blue/gray eyes. A gorgeous smile!



Women look at him!! Always! Especially when he is doing anything with the kids - he is the best and most hands on dad. I look sloppy even when I try to dress up. I haven't been hit on in years. It's super depressing. But, I do know that he is still attracted to me. And I am currently dieting and starting to see some changes. I plan to start working out a little soon, too. I think I need to build my confidence up for me instead of focusing on what he/others think. I know that sounds obvious, but it's easier said than done. I've also started take hair/skin/nails vitamins a couple months ago and I think they are helping to speed up my hair growth. Even having these plans started and seeing tiny differences is starting to increase my confidence in myself. And my motivation. I'm hoping that will continue to get stronger and one day I will feel as happy with myself as I used to be!"
134,I weigh less than my husband but I'm a shorty and he is well.over 6 foot. So he is tall and fairly muscular and im short and dumpy especially since we had kids. I'm definitely a lot fatter than him. Even if th scales would tell a different story. I have no idea how stranger perceive me I'm too busy chasing 2 toddlers around to actually stop and look at people around us. I imagine they don't give a shit tho because why would they? Seriously have you ever stopped to think about the weight different between a couple of strangers? I deal by exercising and eating well (down 20kg so far) and by believing him when he tells me he is attracted to me.
135,"I'm not even heavier than my husband but still, he is very tall and thin and I am very short and average. When I am not around my husband I even feel skinny, and girls would ask me how do I keep my weight so well (after I lost 15 kg). But when I am with my husband I feel like I should get rid of like 30% of myself to fit the proportion. Or that he should gain some weight. So I assume it's not about being heavier than your partner, it's more about the proportion that you make as a couple. If you asked boys ""How do you feel when your partner is taller than you?"" you would probs get the same responses as girls are giving here."
136,"I'm not that much bigger than my SO, but slightly. I do wonder all the time if he'd like me more if I was skinny, but he always says he loves how I look. Gives me compliments, says that I already am skinny and tries to feed me snacks. He honestly does everything right, even when I'm naked, he'd spend so much time kissing me all over.

I think that unless we appreciate ourselves, we won't think what they say is true. I try to see what he sees but I can't and that's okay. His compliments get me through the worse days."
137,"My partner is very thin and I'm curvy and a bit over weight. I sway between loving my body and hating it. He is self conscious about his body and was shocked to hear I was the same about mine. Sometimes I get the line ""fatty and skinny"" echo in the back of my head and I get uncomfortable. I've never really considered how others see us.

I do get paranoid that if we're cuddling that I'm squashing him, even if he assures me it's not the case.

The fun side effect is that he gets really cold and I generate heat, so that works!"
138,I can say with certainty that certain girls won't date guys who've dated bigger girls.
139,I am both taller and heavier than my partner as well as being different races so whenever people stare I always wonder what bit of our relationship they find the ‚Äúweirdest‚Äù
140,"I was heavier than my first ex boyfriend but you wouldn't know i was 200ish pounds, I carry very well. However my ex was a tall stick.

People were more curious to how i was attracted to him  since i had a full curvy figure. To be honest, I wasnt shallow or vien and i didn't care how someone looked when I started dating. So to me it didn't matter how skinny he was. He was smart funny and we had similar interests. 

I did worry I would crush him since i am heavy and painfully aware of it, so I'm sure people were thinking that too. Most of our friends and college mates didn't say anything. It's was mostly people complaining I chose him over them, bullcrap.

I have dated guys who were bigger and people were werided out and pointed. One person who thought she was sly and spoke in Arabic call my ex fat and called me stupid for being with a ""fat ugly man"". You bet your ass i called her out in Arabic.! I don't tolerate ass holes who can't mind their own business.

I find that peopke are more ok and don't judge when im dating a gym goer since they tend to be more rough (if you know what i mean) so it make sense to be with a girl who has more padding. 

Also i love quoting this line ""thicker guy need thicker girls"" and I'm damn proud of being a curvy girl because i get all those sweet ass man who work out. So yeah im a bit vain now since psychically attractions is important (unfortunately). But hey we like what we like and we want what we want.

At the end of the day, who gives a carp what people think."
141,"So I‚Äôm heavy, like almost as wide as I am tall (5ft 3 in), with tattoos piercings and pink hair, almost 30 and still have zits and not really pretty at all, and with a noticeable lazy eye and super crowded teeth... He‚Äôs around 6ft 3in, handsome, blonde blue eyed, broad shouldered and only a little chubby. People look at us weird all the time. I‚Äôve even had a few people assume we were siblings or cousins rather than a couple! We don‚Äôt even look alike, lol. I just laugh because fuck it. That‚Äôs their problem not mine. I have noticed it‚Äôs women who look at us funny more than men. 

Him tho? He loves my fat ass. Gets hard when I‚Äôm walking around in my underwear. Like nothing he‚Äôs ever done makes me feel like he isn‚Äôt attracted to me, and I‚Äôve gained like two pants sizes since we got together. He‚Äôs always telling me I‚Äôm beautiful and making me feel beautiful. Even when I question something, like how a shirt fits or whatever, he says ‚Äúif anyone has an issue with it they can talk to me‚Äù."
142,"I do worry sometimes, especially since I have body dysmorphia related to my belly and chin, but I try not to think about it because it makes me sad. I‚Äôm a healthy person in terms of my lifestyle and I work out 4-5 days a week, but my boyfriend is very, very thin and lean,  and I‚Äôm both really broad and a bit chubby. Because I‚Äôm muscular as well as flabby, I weigh *significantly* more than he does (we‚Äôre talking like 50 pounds more- he‚Äôs a very lean guy). Sometimes I feel like this lumbering Hulk next to him and it makes me feel bad about myself. But he is so sweet to me and constantly tells me he loves my body, and I‚Äôm doing my best to stay active and eat well, so there‚Äôs really nothing else I can do at this point.

As far as what strangers think, I don‚Äôt really care. I more just get down sometimes that I feel my boyfriend ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù a girlfriend with a better figure. I know that‚Äôs ridiculous and my body dysmorphia talking, but it‚Äôs hard. I was very thin for my frame when he and I got together."
143,"I'm bigger than my bf, always been about 40 lbs heavier, and he's a couple inches taller than me and fucking built, muscular body, abs, arms all that, but he loves my size. In high school he was the popular jock, Prom King, played all sports and got a scholarship to college, while I was the nerdy fat girl who skipped school to go to the library. Total opposites, in every way possible. (I thought.) Now 20 years later we're madly in love, have so much in common and can talk all night long. I never thought a man like him would be interested in a woman like me, but in the beginning I asked him about his 'type' and he said 'it's not what you look like, it's how you make me feel.' And he has never said one negative thing about my weight in the years we've been together, he compliments me every day, tells me how beautiful I am  and how much he loves me and my fat butt. lol. We've both been through shitty relationships and agree that we are the happiest we've ever been with each other. I used to worry about what other people thought about us together, but he makes me feel so secure in myself and in our relationship that it doesn't bother me anymore. He treats me like a queen and we're expecting our first child in July! Of course I'm gaining weight due to being pregnant but he loves every inch, he rubs lotion on my belly and talks to the baby and has been everything I ever looked for in a partner. I honestly never thought I'd ever be this happy. Sorry for rambling, point is, you can find true love in the strangest places, don't let your fears hold you back from living your best life. There truly is someone who will love you and value you completely, flaws and all. =)"
144,"My partner and I are the same height and I probably weight twice as much as he does. I know he finds me attractive. He tells me all the time and doesn't let me forget it. As for strangers, we've already had our run ins for being an interracial couple in the south so I know people already see us as not belonging together. I don't really worry about the weight issue because to me it's not an issue. It's just a fact. I'm bigger than him. 


There is a whole show that focuses on, and I fucking hate this term, ""mixed weight couples"" called Hot and Heavy on TLC. I've never watched it but I'm pretty sure it addresses this questions in the most dramatic way possible."
145,"When we first got together I did worry about whether he found me attractive and sexy but his consistent actions, compliments, and obvious sexual desire eliminated that concern and hasn‚Äôt left a doubt in my mind. Now I‚Äôm just free to enjoy his perfect muscular body without a worry (and it is fabulous!)
And I never worry about how strangers perceive us. 
I think the key was in his actions/reactions to me."
146,"Deal with it by learning how to love yourself each day more. By trying to make healthier choices, exercising (a.k.a releasing ‚Äúfeel sexy‚Äù hormones lol), pampering yourself, and understanding your irrational beliefs so you can confront and debunk them. When we learn to love ourselves, we glow from within! Learn how to more than just accept your flaws, learn to love them. You are you, and other people will not only love you for who you are as they will learn to love you as you love yourself!"
147,"I'm a plus size woman and I tend to attract average sized men. In high school it bothered me a little bit, but I managed to ignore it because they seemed happy. When I married my (now ex) husband he made me feel good about my body, so I didn't care about what strangers thought."
148,Not too worried. He still gets a gleam in his eye when he looks at me.
149,"My SO is very tall and very lean. I'm tall and skinny fat. I don't really have concerns about what strangers think because my clothed appearance hides my flab relatively well, but I've definitely had my share of concerns about my SO thinking that I am fat or unattractive. 

However... I keep those concerns to myself. It is not his job to fix my self-image problems/self-esteem issues, and I don't want to give him the impression that it is by dumping my insecurities into his lap. He has never given me any actual reason to believe that he isn't attracted to me so I don't see the purpose of asking him for validation. 

I guess the answer to your question of how I deal is that I remind myself that it's my own negative, ""itty bitty shitty committee"" making noise when I have those thoughts. I try to center myself in reality when they occur."
150,"I‚Äôm heavier than my man,  but I just... don‚Äôt care? I know he finds me sexy. I‚Äôve never looked at a couple with different body sizes and thought anything about it.

I‚Äôm in my 30s so I think 10 years ago it would have really bothered me, but now I know that weight is just a fact, not something that defines who I am. 

I think it also comes down to your own self confidence and how you feel about yourself."
151,"I used to get this a lot - I was around 4 dress sizes bigger 10 years ago.  I always hated seeing myself naked - let alone anybody else seeing it!

I still have problems today though, as even though I‚Äôm around a UK size 6, I look in the mirror and my reflection is a 14 - I still can‚Äôt seem to shake that vision and the lack of confidence is therefore still there.  I realise I‚Äôm relatively tiny in comparison, but I can only ever see it when somebody else takes a photo of me and shows me.

I realise how stupid this all sounds, I am partially sane really..!"
152,"I used to worry, but after 25 years together, I'm (mostly) okay with it. I am absolutely, positively, sure that he loves me and wants  me. Hell, about 10 minutes ago he was pelvic thrusting in my general direction singing ""Don't you want me, Baby..."" because I had a mammogram this morning and I'm in a bad mood and he wanted to make me laugh. 

Sometimes I get sad about my weight and withdraw a bit, but that's all about me and never about him. He's been an unshakable horn dog for 25 years, so that probably has a lot to do with it!"
153,"Self-confidence is the key. And your SO plays a major part in helping you building it!

I used to think I was fat compared to my boyfriend (he really is toned). The thing is... in fact, I'm, like, thinner than average. Objectively. But I was obsessed with how beautiful he is... With time, I grew more confident and he helped me a lot, telling me that I'm beautiful and that if I want to be a bit fitter, I can do sports. Which I do now, because I love doing sports.

And by the way, others do not matter. They're not your SO and they're not you. Strangers are even more meaningless: they will never remember you.

If you love yourself, that's all that matters! And if your SO does... then everything's perfect!"
154,"I always feel a bit insecure because I always admire him physically a lot and will never be able to imagine him doing the same to me because of my weight. He can say he loves my body and all that but at the end of the day I know he can't find my stretch marks, large belly, wobbly parts etc attactive. I don't mean any offence to any heavier women - those things aren't anything to be ashamed of but it's no lie that they make myself unhappy when I see them on my own body.

How do I cope? Well, I usually pretend I'm someone else üòÇ during any intimacy I usually avoid looking at myself but I don't hide from him, I sort of pretend in my head that my body is how I'd like it etc. My boyfriend is wonderful and never says anything bad about me yet will be honest about me needing to lose weight. When we're out I do feel embarrassed because of how better looking he his but I just try and twist to my advantage by thinking how lucky I am he chose me"
155,"I‚Äôm fairly curvy and my boyfriend is muscly but with a skinny build. I‚Äôve been worrying about this, especially recently as I‚Äôve gained a bit of weight. Whenever I bring it up he constantly tells me that it doesn‚Äôt matter and that he loves me no matter what. Not to get too NSFW but we also have a very healthy sex life and I can tell he‚Äôs very attracted to me. His ex was very tiny like 4‚Äô10 and 90 lbs so this worried me a bit initially, but it‚Äôs never been an issue for us."
156,"(Sorry, english isn't my first language).

There was a time in my life where I was heavier than my boyfriend. 

He had once admitted before we started dating that he was into petite girls, so I had an anxiety attack in his house when I weighed myself and realized I had gained so much weight due to depression that I was 5kg heavier than him.

He hugged me and promised me that he loved my body and he'll love every part of me.

I guess you just have to be confident, your weight doesn't define who you are, I learnt during that time to be confident in your own skin."
157,"I‚Äôm significantly bigger than my partner. It‚Äôs a constant worry, because he never really verbalizes how he physically (or emotionally, for that matter) feels towards me. But at the same time he‚Äôll comment on ‚Äúhot‚Äù or ‚Äúcute‚Äù girls on tv. Hurts my feelings a lot, actually, but then I figure it‚Äôs not his fault he‚Äôs attracted to a thin body and not fat."
158,"Right now I'm 208 and my boyfriend is 170ish. This is the lightest I've been in ten years. My ex topped out at 185ish. So being heavier and plumper than my partner is a long term situation for me.

Yes, my weight/size effects my self esteem and consequently my opinion of how attractive my partner must find me. 

When my ex stopped being sexual with me I blamed myself for my appearance/size. I blamed myself for my housekeeping ability/laziness. I blamed myself for all the possible reasons. In the end it was because we fell out of love.

With my current that is new partner, I've lost so much weight before his eyes, that my mindset is different. But, he has said at times that I'm not attractive (we have a weird, rocky relationship).

I think for this guy it's his own insecurities. He has a disability and hasn't come to terms with is newly limited abilities (new as of ten years ago). So because he's not his old ski-instructor self, he feels bad. Because I'm not a fitness beauty, he sees himself I guess, he sees my appearance as a reminder of his ability level.

Do there's some shiftiness from his end. For me now, the new me who just lost 75lb, who is fitter now than ever in my adult life, well. I couldn't have done it without my boyfriend. I'm happy that I'm active. And I have the perspective and wisdom to see his b.s. for what it is.

I love you Chris but my belly does not mean I'm a shitty person and your weak arms don't mean you are shitty either. Fuck we're 40. Let's just be grateful that we can hike and bike and swim at all."
159,"Man on the opposing side here so I hope I‚Äôm not overstepping:

My SO is certainly not fat, but she likely weighs more than me currently and isn‚Äôt as fit as I am. She deals with hormonal issues that make weight/fat loss very difficult.  She has voiced to me that she shares all of the concerns you mention here. Even with me she can be self-conscious and take some coaxing to even take her shirt off when we‚Äôre intimate. 

That being said, I am beyond attracted to her and have made it clear that I do not need her to radically change herself for me because I am quite obviously more than happy with how she looks. There would be days where she‚Äôd preemptively warn me that she ‚Äúlooks fatter‚Äù or ‚Äúgained weight‚Äù and then when I see her I‚Äôm blown away as I always am by how beautiful she is and how much I love her. 

This past week we were quarantined together and she was being self-conscious, so I told her, ‚Äúfianc√©e, you know that I hate my body and you think it‚Äôs great, and you know that I love your body even though you hate your body, so our best bet is to just support eachother in doing the things that will make us both love our own bodies more, because that‚Äôd be a great thing for the other person too.‚Äù"
160,"I love that we're talking about this! I'm a short but plus size lady, my guy is quite slim. If I were younger I think it would bother me a lot, I'd feel really insecure about it. But I've come a long way in weight loss, mental health, etc and I'm lretty happy where I'm at now. 

And this man... he loves me, loves my body, lets me know every chance he gets, and same in return. We are very attracted to each other. He's almost always had plus size girlfriends, not jn a creepy fetish way (dated that once, ick) but just... That's what he's attracted to.

Now, we do get some weird looks sometimes. He thinks it's because I'm all sweet and nice looking and he's a bit rough around the edges. I am fairly certain it's because we look like Jack Sprat and his wife. Either way... It's very noticeable and sometimes hurts one of our feelings. Idk what strangers are sraring at, I'm too afraid to ask. 

People who know us and occasionally strangers will tell us how cute we are together though so I try not to think about the jerks."
161,"My boyfriend never really minded

He likes my body and my shape. I'm a little overweight but in fairly good shape. He is just build thinner and doesn't gain easily. Where as I am a gaining mess. He loved me no matter what so that's nice :)

It's all about how they respond to your body and how you feel about it. 

Personally I hate it and I wanna lose more weight but it's just hard"
162,"I'm bisexual and find women and men of many sizes attractive, their personality matters way more to me than looks. So I figure if I find women of various sizes attractive then he can too. We've been together for 14 years and I've been 30 pounds lighter and 30 pounds heavier than I am now and gone through major body changes with pregnancy and he's been consistently attracted to me throughout. I find that if you love someone, that fuels your attraction towards them more than anything else."
163,No. *sits on his face unbothered*
164,"I‚Äôm a lot heavier than my husband but he doesn‚Äôt care at all and still finds me very attractive, which makes me not care as much about how we‚Äôre viewed in public"
165,"I‚Äôm two stone heavier than my partner. I‚Äôm actually 4 stone heavier than his August 2019 weight. He‚Äôs gained two stone of muscle since we started dating. I‚Äôve lost 4 stone since I met him. So when we met we were really far apart in terms of weight. He‚Äôs super attractive and physically fit and I‚Äôm flabby af. I‚Äôve actually lost 12 stone since my heavjest so I have a monstrosity of a body. In fact when we started dating I kept telling myself this wouldn‚Äôt work and that once I told him what was wrong with my body he‚Äôd ghost me.

Turns out he doesn‚Äôt give a shit. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre in our thirties and maybe aren‚Äôt as shallow as when we were twenty? He tells me that I made him laugh a lot so I think it‚Äôs a case of us being compatible over many levels. It‚Äôs helped me heal from a bad marriage and from some really bad insecurities. Knowing he loves me even though my skin around my torso is like a baggy jumper, it gives me a lot of strength. I‚Äôll have surgery eventually but he‚Äôd love me even if I didn‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm still very insecure about my fapron (fat apron) but nowhere near as bad as I could be about it."
166,"I'm about 30 pounds heavier than my spouse, but it doesn't concern me because:

1.  She is very very tiny.
2. The general public and her give me a lot of affirmation about my looks."
167,[removed]
168,"My partner is the heaviest he's been in his life at 130lbs, I'm the heaviest I've ever been at 270 lbs. 

 I do worry about how attractive my partner finds me, but he's pretty good at reminding me he thinks I'm hot af. He's also an emotionally expressive goofball (okay we are both goofballs. great big dorks. One great big dork and one gangly muppet. whatever.) and frankly most of the looks I get from strangers are a) women who are amused and slightly jealous my man is so clearly in love and so willing to communicate this b) older folks who smile at us the way you do at baby animals falling over and c) younger straight dudes carefully controlling their expression. Probably sometimes what they're concealing is some variety of disgust but also fairly likely is wishing their friends group would allow him to have a chubby girlfriend without socially eviscerating him, or wishing he could be as emotionally expressive as my partner is, again without his social circle punishing him for perceived weakness. I have met and talked with and dated and dumped and been dumped by men with all of these struggles, toxic masculinity is fucked up.

I guess I do occasionally get shittier looks from women in packs, but tbh it's easier to dismiss that as being less genuine and more that it probably feels socially 'safer' to be dismissive of bodies like mine and is among the only ways these women have to feel collectively superior to others. I don't usually get those reactions from women on their own, so. Fucked up social dynamics are not a good way to judge one's own value.

I also don't have to worry about him suddenly not liking me for gaining weight! We have been there and done that.

I dunno, I do important worthwhile shit with my life, what other people think about my body doesn't change that."
169,Nope.
170,Naw. My partner‚Äôs a good 30 lbs lighter than me but I‚Äôve never felt weirded out by it. Plus he reminds me almost daily about how much he enjoys being with me or about me being curvy.
171,"My boyfriend told me way before we started dating that he prefers when girls are a little chubbier. 

He‚Äôs tall and slim and I‚Äôm very short and kinda chubby. 

I never forget that he said that because whenever I feel a bit insecure about how I look with him it makes me feel better."
172,"I've always been heavier than my husband. He's 5' and I'm 5'5"". I'm a tad overweight and focusing on getting healthy not sexy. I've lost 12 pounds since July and have 8 more to go. 

My husband absolutely loved it when I put on more weight. We met my freshman year in college and got married after graduation. I carry my weight in my hips, butt, and thighs which he finds attractive. 

I don't worry about it because he's never been critical of my appearance in any way. I have never felt judged by strangers as an adult. I was underweight until high school and was asked if I was anorexic/teased about my body."
173,[removed]
174,[removed]
175,I feel this! My bf has seen me at so many different weights and he consistently has a 6 pack. He and I both talk about our attractions to various body types and this helps too. Theres so much beauty in others and when we take time to acknowledge it it helps me see my beauty too
176,"Definitely. My BF is more attractive and way more fit than I am, but he made it clear my personnality is what matters, and we still have a good sex drive, so that's a hint that my body is enough."
177,"I like the first part of this. They've chosen to be with you for a reason other than (hopefully) your body. 

However, I don't know that it should be implied that you trust everything else a partner says. By the very nature of doubting and feeling anxiety about your appearance, it's likely that you may also feel you cannot trust them fully. This kind of worry stems from a lack of trust that is likely in other aspects of the relationship too."
178,"Quality over quantity, he knows what he has. That should gas your head up instead of making you feel self-conscious."
179,"I feel this too, a lot of girls try to hit on my boyfriend, every woman in his work basically throw themselves at him and when we go out he's just this tall guy with pale skin dark hair light brown eyes and I'm just a stupid fatty trying to walk in heels so I can be sexy but all I manage to do is look like an elephant in sticks."
180,This is so cute. My bf and I are the same and we both get insicure as well. For some reason I‚Äôve noticed that lean/skinny guys go for the curves a lot
181,It's exactly the same for my boyfriend and I
182,So cute.
183,"Thiiiiisssss!!!!! It‚Äôs what I tell myself all the time. Sometimes I get so insecure (and I‚Äôm not overweight per say, but I have put on weight since we got together) and yet I get annoyed when he disparages himself. I realised then that I‚Äôve got to try not to say bad things about myself because if I find him stunning despite what he says, he finds me stunning despite what I say, and that‚Äôs what matters. I still struggle not to put myself down but I‚Äôm working on it!"
184,Usually insecure men go for insecure women because that's all they think they can get because usually it is. Stop making excuses and just lose weight.
185,Good luck! You are making a great progress <3
186,This sums up my experience too
187,Check out Pierce Brosnan and his wife Keeley. They don‚Äôt give a fuck and neither should you. They love and adore each other in an industry and city that values looks above all else.
188,"> I often find myself thinking other women probably wonder why he's with me. 

I can not imagine walking down the street looking at other couples and thinking ""Why is he with _HER_?"" People pay a lot less attention to you that you fear. Most people are dealing with their own shit, and aren't roaming around looking for people to pass judgement on."
189,Friendly reminder that taking care of yourself doesn‚Äôt have to mean losing weight! First year of having a kid is tough ‚ù§Ô∏è you‚Äôre doing a great job!
190,There is no such thing as bouncing back. Don't do that to yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è
191,"This, I can relate so hard. I want to start exercising but am finding hard. I keep reminding myself I will get there, even if it's slowly cause my time for me has reduced."
192,"I worry about this too! I sometimes look at pictures of myself before I was pregnant vs now and it‚Äôs like a different person. I am not happy with how I look, so I wonder how he can be? He just tells me he loves me for me, but there are still doubts."
193,"You and your partner have roughly the same height difference I had with my ex gf. She couldn't handle all the jokes and comments though. God bless you two, I hope you stay together forever."
194,"Love it - you gotta love what you have, if not, you have the power to change it 

So true"
195,"I'm the same, I'm about 10lbs heavier but he's all arm muscle and stocky torso, I'm all boobs haha. I make a joke that my goal isn't to lose weight, I just want to be a little under what he is to even it out a bit. He doesn't notice, I'm sure boobs are a positive no matter what size."
196,Lol I hate that crap. For the first time in 6 years of being with my boyfriend I weigh less than him but I still look bigger because I'm all ass and thighs. Oh well!
197,"There‚Äôs a way to have this conversation with a partner that is full of care and love, not with this kind of hurt and breach of trust. I truly love my partner, and we have both had to have conversations with each other about taking care of ourselves. We want each other to be healthy and live a long time, and that is driven by love and care: I‚Äôm sorry that the conversation you two had went this way - you are a worthy person, filled with infinite possibility, no matter what you weigh today. I hope your partner learns how to better communicate to make you feel that way too"
198,"When I gained weight, mine told me sex was ""different"" now, and it just gutted me.  I didn't say anything then because the comment just made me shut down.  He also isn't great at communicating and often picks the worst possible thing he could say to your girlfriend, even though he has the kindest intentions.  It took me way too long, but I told him how much that hurt, and how hard it was for me to bring it up because I didn't want to seem like I was fishing for compliments.  He apologized, and we talked things out so we both understood each other's feelings.  I still don't have daily worries and struggles with my weight, and I just wish they understood how devestating some comments could be (and make some nice comments a little more often!)."
199,"While I was on dialysis my weight ballooned to be about 95kg (210 lbs) and I‚Äôm 1.5 M (5‚Äô1) Stature wise I‚Äôm a small woman but I weighed as much as a 1.82 M (6 foot) man. I knew deep down that He didn‚Äôt find me attractive like he did in the past. Every time I brought it up he would tell Me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre gorgeous babe‚Äù it wasn‚Äôt until after I got my transplant my weight started to shed and he finally admitted to me what I already knew. 

My point being is that even though your partner may suck at communicating at times, I think it might have been for the best to know his feelings upfront rather than months of him pretending. I certainly would‚Äôve like to have known. I‚Äôve bonded over going to the gym with my husband because he‚Äôs not happy with his body and we‚Äôre both are actively wanting to better ourselves for ourselves and for each other. Maybe your partner could also eat better (it never hurts) and go on walks with you or be your gym buddy. Having that support is huge when going through this journey."
200,[removed]
201,"I understand completely. My ex had done a lot to hurt my self esteem. When I started that relationship, I was very much OK with myself. At the end, I realized that I hated myself and I just could not believe that I let someone take that from me and that I did not even realize it was happening! 

Unfortunately, my current bf is dealing with this still, but it has gotten a lot better."
202,"This is just adorable, and you guys sound very sweet together. :)"

208,"I'm the same height as my husband and about the same amount heavier then him too. I think it's probably noticeable when people see us, but more noticeable are the people who comment on my height, since I tend to wear chunky shoes and end up taller than him. The amount of people who have asked him if he ""allows"" me to wear heels etc is ridiculous."

222,"Same. My partner now husband, has seen me a lean/underweight overworked eighteen year old waitress....then slowly get chubby when I didn‚Äôt need to work as much and enjoyed plenty of stress relieving Ben and Jerry‚Äôs üòÇ A year of that prompted me to actually learn about nutrition and feeding myself well, leading to a two year journey too vegetarianism and loosing 25lbs, returning to a lean sexy figure that I definitely have to constantly work to keep. While he has an extremely quick metabolism and a consistent six pack no matter *what* he eats üòãüòÇüòâ"
223,"Wise man! Looks fade, it shouldn't be valued as a necessity."
224,"This is sweet but I don‚Äôt think I would be happy personally if my partner only ever told me he was attracted to my personality.  It almost would feel like a backhanded compliment to me. 

Maybe that says something not so great about me, but even if I don‚Äôt feel attractive to myself, I would like my partner to compliment both my looks and my personality."
225,best reply :)
226,About other things sure but weight can be such and insecurity that people obsess over.
227,I feel this so much
228,"Daddyseahors3, you‚Äôre a nasty person. I bet you‚Äôre no fun at parties and you probably just abandon your grocery cart in the parking lot."
229,"Just googled them, how adorable! They‚Äôre both gorgeous, but you‚Äôre right, she‚Äôs not exactly who Hollywood would pair with him."
230,"This is so, so important to remember! It's incredibly freeing to realize that you can get some exercise without having weight loss as a goal. You can make an effort to eat healthy foods without it being a diet. You don't have to punish yourself if you can't do these things every single day. You can do things like that for yourself, because they feel good, and you and your body deserve to be treated well."
231,"Seriously that. ""Bouncing back"" implies someone fell off some standard, and then also implies it should be easy to get back to that. Neither is true.

A pregnancy is both a life- and bodychanging experience. It's perfectly fine to *not* look like nothing happened half a year later, or ever. It is a permanent change, and that is more than fine.

When we see celebrities who four weeks after giving birth seem to look like before, we need to keep in mind that there was a whole team working on that behind the scenes, personal trainers, diet assistants, nannies, and likely some doctors numbing this and pulling that (for the cases where you truly can't tell at all a few months hence). 

This is not normal, it is unpleasant to endure and takes the kind of time ‚Äì and *money* ‚Äì that normal people don't have after a birth. They do that because it is part of their job to look a certain way and their image generates money for them. But it's not a standard any normal person should hold themselves to."

239,"Same lol I typically hear ‚Äúif her boobs and booty stick our further than her belly then it‚Äôs fair game‚Äù.

240,"We‚Äôre long-distance (some 200 km from each other, so normally we see each other once every other weekend... not rn with the virus of course). So we are really big on communication. He‚Äôll text me that he misses me/my butt/[insert body part here], and when we‚Äôre together we‚Äôre always extra cuddly. Best comment I‚Äôve heard so far: ‚ÄúI never believed in the ‚Äòbigger girls have more of them to love‚Äô, but it‚Äôs so true!‚Äù Generally we also talk a lot about what makes our relationship great, how much we enjoy each other‚Äôs company, etc. 

I am a bigger girl (185 lbs at 5 ft 8) and although I am in the process of losing a bit of weight, I don‚Äôt ever think I‚Äôll ever be skinny (I wouldn‚Äôt really want to either, I‚Äôm aiming to be 160-165 lbs). I‚Äôm really physically active and eat well, and I feel like that‚Äôs what counts. 

To be fair I never expected to have such a loving, wholesome relationship. I had a string of really awful ones, including one of with a narcissist that bordered on mental abuse, so this came as a really big surprise."
241,"I feel the same way and I think it‚Äôs normal to want to be complimented on personality and looks. I also assume that if they‚Äôre having good sex often, he‚Äôs attracted to her body as well. So it‚Äôs sorta messed up that he won‚Äôt compliment that as well."
242,"Absolutely. Weight is an extremely sensitive subject. My point was that you can never assume that people trust everything else their partner says. If trust is lacking in one area, it's likely in others in a relationship."

Yes she is. She was typically Hollywood skinny when they got together."

249,"I meant to reply to the parent one

-


‚ÄúThis question brought tears to my eyes. I'm heavier than my partner by about 20 kgs. He's also a very slim build whereas I've always been curvy. He recently told me that he's less attracted to me since I gained a bit more weight and it's been a burden ever since. I've always had the thought in the back of my head of whether it makes a difference to him, I guess it does. No one else has ever brought it up.

He's not a bad guy, he just doesn't know how to communicate. I'm trying to lose weight now but for health reasons, not just for him. Sorry about the long answer, I needed to get this off my chest.‚Äù"
250,"I‚Äôm one of the bigger girls in my circle of friends and acquaintances (in general not many overweight/obese people where I live), so it depends for sure! Have always been considered as ‚Äúbig‚Äù even when I weighed less :p

Honestly it was difficult at first! But you have to choose to believe, at some point. I think it happened to me like 8 months into my relationship when I saw that, yeah, this guy actually does love me and I don‚Äôt have a valid reason not to trust him. 

And thanks, I hope so too!"

Hope this comment helps."
270,"Sounds like they want their ego stroked. If you mentioned another guy they might make a move, but then their interest wouldn't be genuine. They just wouldn't want you with someone else.

275,"Somebody who doesn't ""like you enough"" isn't necessarily trying to get their ego stroked, playing hot and cold with you, etc. People feel the way they feel. Sometimes they just don't feel as strongly about you as you do about them.

Anyway, greener pastures."
285,"Here's what you do: you cut your losses and move on. No matter how much it sucks.  

It's a sign that the relationship has run it's course and you're not meant to be with that person for the long term. There is nothing you can do to change people's minds about this, it's not up to you who other people love or how much."
286,Move on. I'm not interested in a partner who isn't as interested in me as I am in them.

290,"I'm an introvert, so it took me coming out of my comfort zone and putting myself out there, making spontaneous decisions when an opportunity to meet new people presented itself. I matched with my husband on a dating app and met him in person the same night. I didn't waste my time with those who didn't fit my needs or values because I made me being selfish a priority, and that's how I ended up dating some really great guys and having great options to pick from once I was ready to settle down and give it a shot. That's my experience and two cents."
291,"I need to adopt that mindset with these dating apps, thanks for sharing"
292,"Not really. Occasionally if it‚Äôs like...a particularly weird or funny story. But I‚Äôm the same way. I don‚Äôt bother mentioning men hitting on me most of the time because it‚Äôs usually ‚Äúthis guy asked me out, I said no, and that‚Äôs the end.‚Äù I usually think it‚Äôs funny."
293,"Getting hit on is not special, or an event to remember. It happens, and we move on about our day."
294,"In the beginning of my relationship, after it was deemed serious and long term, he was wary about telling me about them. Mostly because he responds in silly ways, and I've seen it.

Once, we were sitting at a food court in the mall, not holding hands or anything couple-y, just looked like two 20 year olds eating. A women approached him and asked if we were a thing. He said "" Yes, I am seeing her, and luckily she doesn't mind that I'm essentially a Ken Doll down there"". She turned around and walked away without another word. This led to us talking about his other encounters and he likes to just say wacky things to make them go away."
295,I've had some guys do it intentionally to probably incite jealousy. I don't need someone to stress me out or play mind games. Otherwise what would be the point of mentioning it?
296,"I can't remember anytime when he's mentioned that, because he's so oblivious to these things that I can't imagine he would even notice!"
297,"He has done. Not for a long time now, though. It was usually a funny story and I kind of miss him telling me. Given they were all younger & probably thinner than me, it made me feel good that he chose me despite having lots of other opportunities."
298,"No, because shes not the type to even notice when people flirt with her, which is really funny to see live."
299,"Nope. My ex used to do this all the time, though, and it really pissed me off. It's one of many reasons he's my ex.

If your SO needs to make it a point to tell you when women are hitting on him he may have self esteem and self worth issues and places too much emphasis on his desirability. Or he may be using these situations (or fabricating them) to hurt you. Either way, giant red flag."
300,"Only if it‚Äôs remarkable in some way. He gets really aggressively hit on sometimes. 


Usually I‚Äôm just amused. Sometimes horrified at how graceless some women can be."
301,"Sometimes, if it is excessive. I wouldn‚Äôt want to know (or care, tbh) if some random cashier hit on them, but if they have a coworker that is becoming increasingly aggressive with their flirting, I‚Äôd want to know.

It doesn‚Äôt really make me feel anything unless the story is funny."
302,"He'll mention it if it seems relevant. So, he may/may not mention that some random tried to flirt with him at the store, but he would definitely tell me if a friend or coworker did. I feel fine about it. He shuts them down effectively and efficiently, so he's just telling me so I know in case that person continues to be inappropriate."
303,"Nah, I don't need to know if a lady looked. Now, if someone went out of their way to interact, especially if he had to stop her, then I want to know. And if the person is someone we know/I know/he knows/will see etc, I NEED to know."

In text? Slowly space your replies until there are none"
311,I muster up the courage and just tell them I don't see it working out and tell them take care. If they bother to ask why (happens rarely) I say exactly what they did that warned me off. If they react negatively (happens even more rarely) I block.

313,"""This isn't going to work out, I just don't think we're compatible but I wish you all the best.""

340,"For everyone on this thread:

I think the thing about learning to do something is that a lot of people want to be able to *do* something, rather than actually *learn to do* something.

Instead of focusing on the end goal, focus on the process. Of course you won't be very good at anything with no experience!

Aim to do little, but often. So rather than spending 2 hours practicing piano one day, or 3 hours on duolingo one day, or an hour running one day, then not doing it again for the next 3 months, try to do a very small amount regularly, an amount that you can keep doing forever.

So 10 minutes of duolingo per day, or 1/2 hour on the piano 4 times each week, or a half hour running every week.

Then keep doing your practice forever.

At first, you will see great progress! It's easy to progress from nothing to something. Then after a while, this will slow down. But keep on practicing. Remember, practice doesn't need to be much, but it must be often and regular. You need to practice to maintain your level."

413,Same! I'm too lazy to even search YouTube tutorials. What is wrong with me!?
414,I also wanted. I have just downloaded Inkscape and watched tutorials on youtube. I highly recommend. ' so fun!
415,Have you tried dance-based workout forms. Something like zumba?
416,"If you get a chance, see if there is a sewing class in your area. I did a one on one class last year and it was great. I sewed a really cute cushion cover and the teacher explained to me the ins and outs of a sewing machine."
417,"I was so uninterested in cooking until my mid-20s but then I moved to another country and missed my mom's cooking so I got really motivated. 

In my experience, the best way to learn is to just do, and experiment and have fun with it. There are no hard and fast rules! Good Luck!"
418,"Try to write down as many words as possible, or characters.

Also, there‚Äôs a free course on Coursera about learning how to learn (i guess that‚Äôs the title of the course), i found it quite useful :D"
419,Throw a dinner party when this is over. Great motivation to pick something to practice at least once or twice before serving it to others.

423,"A lazy way to learn...beauty vloggers on YouTube. I just woke up one day and could do amazing things with my eyes without even trying. They give so many tips and tricks and you watch them apply it while just chatting. 

Say five nice things about yourself in the mirror every day. Don‚Äôt have to be physical traits but can be. Find one thing you LOVE about yourself physically and focus on that every time you look in mirror. Eventually you‚Äôll see how great you are."

427,"Try block coding first, it‚Äôs much easier to understand than regular coding. After that, try moving on to simple ways of coding, such as Java script."
428,I can't recommend this enough!!! And best of all it's free!!
429,I started an Italian course on udemy. Its not free but its definitely worth it! (like $40 usd for the beginner + intermediate courses)
430,YESSSS for Duolingo!
431,"It has the same business model and playstyle as candy crush and it‚Äôs almost as addictive too. Plus, if there‚Äôs something you‚Äôre not getting, you have to practice until you do get it. For this, I don‚Äôt care one little bit if I have to watch a handful of 15 second ads"
432,"I used to feel the same way! I'm an E cup so I don't have it as bad as some, but I find the Berlei underwired + three hook bras are a godsend. I can jump up and down on the spot and run up stairs and nothing hurts!!"
433,Boobands are amazing. It‚Äôs basically a strap that goes under your arms and over your boobs and holds them down. So much more effective and comfortable than an extra bra
434,I used to avoid running for such a long time for this same reason. I highly recommend the Panache Sport bra. I'm an H cup and this bra supports so well that I have no problems with running!
435,"Yes! I just completed the Couch to 5k program. I went from hardly being able to jog for 30 seconds at a time to 30 minutes! Granted, my pace isn't very fast yet but it's so amazing to look back at my progress"

441,"Thanks for the reply ! I already know how to read and have a small understanding of korean from watching korean tv shows. 
It's the big step of learning vocabulary and sentence composition that I'm too lazy for lol.

But you motivated me to start again !"
442,Waar stel je voor dat ik begin?
443,"Right?! I didn't get to do it as long as I wanted, but in the short time that I did, I saw big results! I went from not being able to run at all to doing 2 miles. I went from hating running, to looking forward to it and seeing how much I had progressed. 


Granted, from one session to another, not much progress, but overall, I noticed I had a much easier time breathing and running in general. Seeing your progress is freakin' awesome. It definitely keeps you motivated, you just need to get into a routine."

450,"My relationship with my parents? I don't think it's impacted what I look for in a partner. 

My parents' relationship with each other has influenced me in the sense of having high standards. I would never tolerate a selfish, lazy, disrespectful partner because my mom and dad have a healthy marriage and both of them respect each other and treat each other as equals."
451,"It‚Äôs helped me understand what is not acceptable in an interpersonal, let alone romantic, relationship. Seeing how they each treated me (and others) has helped me understand who I will not be and what I will not do when interacting with my partner, and what I will not accept from a partner."
452,"It‚Äôs actually impacted it a lot for me. My dad was an asshole most of my life and also drank too much. Now we don‚Äôt speak. I‚Äôm overly conscious of traits in potential partners that even slightly resemble those of my dad. For example if a man has too many beers once in a while, says something my dad used to say, has the same political views or hobbies, I instantly feel like I need to break up with them. I know it‚Äôs stupid but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always struggled with. I have to talk myself out of it and remember that even though he wasn‚Äôt a nice person, not EVERY trait he had was inherently bad."
453,"Can't speak for myself (#foreveralone) but my sister's boyfriend is EXACTLY like my dad. They both cook very well (my dad is a chef, and she suspects her bf will go to culinary school after graduating), they're both super dorky and cheesy, both extremely anxious... I keep telling her that Freud said this would happen, and she gets so annoyed with me lmao"
454,"Their relationship with each other made me have a list of things that were absolute dealbreakers for me. 

My parents are incapable of every letting anything go. They are still arguing about things that happened 30 years ago. An argument about whats for dinner can easily evolve into a fight about something someone said 25 years ago. I. HATE IT. If you have a fight, do it and move on. Husband knew I refuse to fight over shit that we should have moved past by now. 

They also have a terrible habit of involving outsiders in family disputes. I understand telling your BFF about something family related but you should never tell your spouses BFF something to try and get them on your side. As my brother and I got older, they started involving us in their fights and literally wouldn‚Äôt let us leave. 

I told my husband both of these dealbreakers very early. I‚Äôm happy to say we‚Äôve been able to avoid these mistakes for the most part but have made plenty of our own."
455,It has not. I consider my parents and my love life thankfully apart from each other.
456,i think seeing my parents relationship affected my own
457,"I don't have the best relationship with my parents... At this point it's neutral, but when I was growing up it was really bad.

As a result I'm looking for a lot more support from a future partner, because I never had that from my family. 

Physical affection wasn't really a thing in my life ever so I need a guy who is okay with being affectionate. So much of my childhood was just violent and angry shouting, walls being punched in, being hauled up by the scruff of my neck, just constant fear and terror... I CANNOT date a man who would ever raise his voice as a reaction to irritation. Unfortunately I found out watching a news video of a fight that that sort of thing, even if I'm not the target, provokes an immediate panic attack reaction in me. Same thing with anger issues or being a hyper-masculine tough guy. I just have no interest there.

I need someone intelligent, who understands the world I inhabit and doesn't make me feel like I'm a freak for enjoying learning-- I'm in a PhD program, it's just a part of who I am. I can't tell my parents anything about what I'm doing because they think it's useless/ don't understand even if I try to break it down to basics. Someone who also won't make fun of me maliciously for liking geekier things like Doctor Who and Lord of the Rings; again these weren't things my parents found acceptably ""cool"" when I was growing up... They were kind of stuck in the high school mindset, and I'm just tired of it. 

I need an SO who actually loves me and doesn't see me as a burden, basically."
458,"I have great parents who always made sure I knew my self-worth and always let me know it was OK to set and keep high standards for the people I allowed in my life.

And while both my parents are great people, their own relationship is/was volatile. Simply put, they don‚Äôt get along or understand each other much anymore. They grew apart, but they‚Äôre still together. Seeing their relationship made me realize what I *dont* want in a partner or a relationship. 

I‚Äôm very lucky to have the romantic relationship that I do, and I believe it‚Äôs due to a combination of what my parents taught me, verbally and non-verbally."
459,"There is not much communication or expression of emotions in my family. I've never seen my dad cry even when some of his closest friends passed away. They/we make passive aggressive remarks, and turn everything into a joke. These are the things I don't like and therefore I realised I want the opposite in a romantic partner.

I am very attracted to people who are open, who talk a lot, who are able to express feelings and be vulnerable. And people who can be really serious when needed, take themselves (and me) seriously. I love funny people but sometimes ya need to be serious!

That being said, my parents are very smart, funny, hard workers and loving, and I know that's also things I want."
460,"I don't think it has. I like who I like regardless of what traits my mom approves or disapproves of. 

Hilariously, there is not a single thing about my current boyfriend she would like."
461,"I think seeing my parents have a relatively happy marriage (which is still going strong) has made me less scared of marriage/commitment than some other people. If they had divorced during my childhood, I'm not sure I would be so open to the idea of marriage."
462,"Grew up without a dad, he passed away from Leukemia. It's very important to me that my partner shows traits of a leader in some way, of the ""head"" of a place or a thing because my dad was this way. I know a part of me tries to replace that with how I choose the guys I date. My first serious bf was the head of the track team in our highschool when I dated him, my second one was a CEO of his own company lmao. It's not a trend that's going anywhere."
463,"I DO NOT want someone who is extremely dominant. My father is like this and can be very domineering to my mother. He yells at her, belittles her, gaslights her sometimes, and makes her think she is always wrong and that he‚Äôs the pinnacle of perfection. There‚Äôs such a power imbalance in their relationship that it‚Äôs sickening. And he uses religion to abuse her in a way saying ‚ÄúGod doesn‚Äôt give [insert whatever trait is good to have as a person of this faith] to disobedient wives who cause division in the house‚Äù. He will say to others, oh yea I believe in letting my wife have an equal say but his actions speak louder than his words and they say the opposite. He doesn‚Äôt acknowledge her needs, desires, feelings, and differences. I simply despise him and don‚Äôt want any man that resembles him. I want a partner who is calm, patient, doesn‚Äôt yell, is open minded, slightly passive, that wants to acknowledge me, and can help make up for the parts I lack. There‚Äôs definitely more but this comment would be twice as long lol."
464,"I consider my parents marriage to be an unhappy one, yes they have their happy moments but for the most part I don‚Äôt see it as positive. 

When I was younger I witnessed domestic violence where my father was the perpetrator and my mother the victim. As I got older, the physical abuse decreased, but I saw an increase in my father‚Äôs emotional abuse towards my mother. 

I recall a time as a teenager and I was angry with my mother and commented that her and my father should have gotten a divorce a long time ago because they do not love each other and he treats her poorly. My mum did not appreciate that comment. 

 I say to myself, I do not want a relationship like my parents, but yet I reflect on previous relationships, as well as my current one and I think I settle too easily. I put up with behaviour that is not appropriate and definitely not what I deserve."
465,"My father is a pretty awful guy and I don't have a relationship with him. When I was younger, I fell into that classic daddy issue trap of falling for guys that reminded me of him. They were pretty disrespectful towards me and I always felt like I had to fight for their attention, much like I did with my father. Eventually, I recognised the pattern and decided to spend time working on myself and my self confidence. I raised my standards and promised myself I wouldn't stay with someone who made me feel small or boring or crazy or any of the other things I felt with the other guys. 
I was single for a long time after the last guy, but earlier this year I met someone who is the complete opposite of my father and the guys from my past. It's still new, but I feel very respected and it's so refreshing."
466,"Easy. I look for people nothing like them LOL! 

I love my parents, but I cannot stand them. I could never date a man like my dad, and I anger I have said that to him.

He offers financial stability and can hold a decent conversation but is incredibly selfish. 

The fact that my mum tolerates this behaviour is infuriating to witness. He‚Äôs not abusive, but how he conducts himself at times should not be accepted.

I think having a mother who accepts bull crap can affect what you accept in your life as a woman also."
467,I‚Äôve realised that I can‚Äôt be with someone who yells at me when I do something wrong/get overwhelmed. My parent‚Äôs yell and it‚Äôs such a downer that I‚Äôd consider to be a strong deal breaker for any relationship is get into
468,"My relationship with my parents is awkward. At least one way. 

They think I'm a loving and committed son, but inside I feel resentment. A lot of it stems from them just drilling in me from my birth that I had to be the best at everything and that if I did something, I had to be better than everyone. 

I never really talked to them about dating and relationships. Growing up they just kind of assumed because I was a ""rockstar"" at everything else relationships and romance would just come naturally to me. That women would just see what a great guy their son was and just gravitate towards me. It's really unhealthy and actually quite awful of a viewpoint. 

It played a lot into my arrogance in my younger years, and when I did struggle with people and dating and what not... i got rocked to my core. 

How has it really impacted me? 

I want to crush or suppress all desires for romantic relationships, because then I could focus on being me. I dislike people, getting to know people, socializing, small talk and all that stuff. But I feel like my parent's desires for me to have a romantic partner supersede my own, and I feel like I'm just fulfilling their wishes being by trying it, and failing them by sucking at it. 

If I had it my way, I would be able to achieve all my goals that don't involve relationships and forget about it altogether."
469,I didn't want to get married because of it.
470,It has had a big impact for me. My father used to yell and verbally abuse my mom and i even over the silliest things like spilling something. i knew my boyfriend was a keeper whenn i spilled wine in his bead and laughed and cleaned it up. i can not and will not deal with men yelling or being unnecessarily angry.
471,"This !

Healthy and balanced wedding is what I want."
472,"Wow. I feel the exact same way. I started therapy and realized a lot, to include why I never liked dating guys that drank a lot. It‚Äôs gross to me."
473,"Oh this is me to a T. My dad would always seem so dominant in heated discussions with my mum, and he is the same with me. I‚Äôm therefore hesitant to let any man into my life."
474,I consider that cheating
475,"I have zero idea what that is.

From other comments, it appears to be related to porn. That's a dealbreaker."
476,I'd put a stop to it. He doesn't need the money and is a father of two.
477," I'd be surprised that he didn't tell me about it a while ago when I mentioned a nsfw website that I go to that only features dudes that have his body type.

I know he's hot & I know he's not fucking around on me, so it wouldn't be a big deal."
478,"If they were open and honest about it, I wouldn't care, they're not actually physically or romantically involved with my SO. I also have no plans of supplementing their loss of income from not doing it."
479,"Surprised. Not ok, unless we had agreed to it beforehand. And where's the money?"
480,"Single. Our perspectives on sex are too different to be compatible in that regard,"
481,Wouldn't care if they were open about it.
482,What's an onlyfans
483,Will be quite put off. Just watch regular stuff like anyone else.
484,"I'd make it rain, of course."
485,"As long as it wasn't their only source of income, I wouldn't care."
486,"Wouldn't care, I have one myself."
487,"Are they making us good money?? Then cool.

If not, then it's probably not worth it"
488,Proud.
489,"If he discussed it with me and made decent money there, I wouldn't mind."
490,"He decided it was not the best decision for his future career, but we've discussed this topic. 


I wouldn't mind as long as he was open and honest about it. To be honest, I'd probably be the one taking his photos. He'd find a way to include me (if I wanted to be included in his projects) 


Plus the extra cash would be nice lol ;)"
491,I'd be surprised and find it hilarious. The money would probably fund his new computer.
492,"I don't know what that is, but it sounds like it might be something I consider cheating."
493,"100% a dealbreaker and it's cheating in my book.

They can have one, but we wouldn't be in a relationship. Our views on sex would be too different and we wouldn't be compatible."
494,"Assuming this is either on the supply or demand side of porn, it would mean that we were incompatible, so our relationship would end."
495,I'd be perfectly fine with it since I also happen to have an onlyfans account.
496,I‚Äôd ask to do collaborative content. I have an OnlyFans myself.
497,Proud.
498,"obviously this is a question and conversation between the people in a relationship.

my partner (male) has brought up helping me make a page several times. although i haven‚Äôt actually done it he hasn‚Äôt expressed any negative types of feelings towards it.

if i decide to make one i would check in with him first to see if he is serious. since i already receive attention from people irl i would have the same conversation with him about what counts as cheating/being unfaithful.

everyone has their own views on this and i believe that it‚Äôs important to discuss them openly and respect them"
499,"Is this about the idubbbz shit? 

This is about the idubbbz shit, isn‚Äôt it? üòí"
500,Agreed
501,Think about patreon but a bit more NSFW (also it most of the time just people posting their nudes than actual porn)
502,No I asked on the askmales subreddit and it was a shitshow so I was just curious what the other 50% (general thoughts) of humans on this earth.
503,Oh well then. Definitely not a fan.
504,"I love, love, LOVE Qcknd! Oh, and Treacle Tatts!"
505,"my favorite beauty youtubers right now are raw beauty kristi, robert welsh, and smokey glow. i find robert to be especially helpful for learning how to do makeup like a real person instead of an internet model."
506,"Monami Frost, Emily Boo, itsblackfriday, Kelly Eden are a few of my favorites."
507,I second Qcknd and Treacle Tatts fo' sho. I also used to watch Wayne Fredrickson quite a lot - maybe check him out and see what you think!
508,"Jenna Marbles, Lad Baby"
509,John Maclean for beauty.
510,"Some channels I love are Katrin Berndt (tattoos, lifestyle, hair/makeup), Alice Lockhart (makeup), and the Dickey Dines Show (metal music and commentary). I would love to find more tattoo centered channels because Katrin Berndt is one of the few good ones who's informative and entertaining. Any recs would be appreciated!"
511,"I love treacle tatts as well, and I've watched Qcknd a while ago but I did just now throw some of her tattoo videos in my watch later. Treacle tatts Katrin Berndt are my two favorite tattoo youtubers, so I wanna find others like them, men as well of course"
512,"Oh hell yeah that's exactly what I'm looking for. I love Alice Lockhart and Evangeline Demuro, but I feel like they're way too advanced for an absolute beginner like me, just as every other beauty youtuber is. Thank you!"
513,Love love love Jenna Marbles!
514,Vilonioustv does tattoo/alternative content as well. Not so much beauty content.
515,"i felt the same way! like all these beautytubers were using techniques that were too advanced for me and that's why i could never get it to look right. then i found robert's channel and realized all those ""advanced"" techniques don't work for me because they're just bad techniques. he's a real life makeup artist, not just a hobbyist trying to look good on camera."
516,"I'm open to all sorts of body modifications, beauty, hair, alternative music. Just alternative in general. I'll check out vilonious too"
517,"Right now I'm starting with his ghost stories series, but I probably will watch some tutorials as well"
518,"I met my boyfriend while I was studying abroad in his home country. It was supposed to be a casual thing but we both caught the feels. We technically broke up when I left, but we ended up getting back together like a few hours after lol. We had plans to go on a holiday and for me to move back, but COVID-19 put a stop to it. We‚Äôre basically just hoping that all of this ends soon so we can start making concrete plans again."
519,"Yes, a student visa. There was way too much red tape for us to consider a future. That, combined with the cultural differences, led to the end of the relationship."
520,"Yes, student visa (we met/dated in college). The visa itself wasn't directly an issue, but a combination of unrelated mental health issues on his end combined and the fact that he potentially wanted to move back to his home country made it nearly impossible for him to really think about a future with me. Admittedly I had some unresolved baggage as well but I was devastated when we broke up."
521,"Yes, quite a long time ago. He came on travel visas and visited somewhat regularly. I learned to speak Dutch damn near fluently because when he was home he would only speak Dutch with me. We did long LONG distance for awhile, but ultimately, it didn‚Äôt work out because I was 21 and stupid. 

Oh, also he was married and hid that from me.  His wife didn‚Äôt speak Dutch. üôÑ Go figure."
522,Not a visa (we‚Äôre both from the EU) but I had to move back home to Ireland about a year after we met. We broke up last June and I still think of him every day..
523,My current boyfriend. We met the tail end of grad school. He got a job before I did and we did long distance for a year. I‚Äôve just moved in with him  and he‚Äôs my absolute best friend. We‚Äôve met each other‚Äôs parents and everything so all very happy despite cultural differences. :)
524,"We got married! Together 7 years, married 6.5!"
525,"I helped him get his green card when I married his ass. We dated for 8 years before we got married, he was on a visa for 4 of those years. We eloped due to visa issues / paperwork timing. We were already committed and living together for 4 years. So when we realized our futures would be more secure if we pulled the trigger right away, we went straight to the courthouse. We had a ""wedding"" and reception 6 months later for the family. There was never a question as to his motives in our dating."
526,He overstayed his student visa and lived with me while he had his own place with roommates. We married six months later out of convenience & fear (Trump changed the rules about overstays on student visas at the time) and we‚Äôve submitted the application for adjustment of status a year later when we saved enough for the fees. However we just got rejected and not sure why yet but likely it‚Äôs bc I don‚Äôt earn enough yet. Hopefully that‚Äôs the case bc it‚Äôs fixable and we can re-file. Overstays can be forgiven if they came in legally and it‚Äôs an immediate family member (spouse). But it‚Äôs risky bc he can get caught at any time before marriage and before application.
527,"Not me but my best friend has been dating a Colombian guy on a student visa for about 2 years.. His Visa expired or something, so technically he was an overstayer without realising. He got deported asap. That was around October of last year. She is moving to Colombia to be with him... Well, I guess not anymore since the whole lockdown thing, but she was set to leave mid April.. 

I really don't want her to go there, but what can you do right."
528,What do you mean by red tape?
529,Do you live in the US or another country?
530,"What kind of situation was your marriage? 

I‚Äôm just interested to know because my parents got married just to make visa stuff easier at the time, despite being madly in love they weren‚Äôt considering marriage yet for the tradition reason but for convenience."
531,Did you end up going to live in their country or did you stay in yours? Are you a US citizen?
532,Why don't you want her to go to Colombia?
533,"It‚Äôs been a while, but as I remember it, the student visa would expire within a year of graduation and in order to stay in the US, he‚Äôd have to get a different visa which required being sponsored by a company. But during that time, the economy still wasn‚Äôt super strong and not a lot of companies wanted to hire visa workers for his industry. 

Things were also complicated because his country didn‚Äôt allow dual citizenship. So I couldn‚Äôt have applied for citizenship in his country either and being a non-citizen permanent resident was also complicated. He‚Äôd lose his entitlement to a lot of government benefits and subsidies if he married a non-citizen, and if we ever had children they would have to choose. he couldn‚Äôt give up his citizenship without losing his ability to support his parents and no way was I going to give up my US citizenship. 

You can apply for a US spousal visa if you get married, but you have to demonstrate your assets and income are a certain level to qualify (I didn‚Äôt have a job yet). You become legally financially responsible for them for up to 10 years even if you divorce, and they can sue you if you fail to support them.

If we had been madly in love and 100% this was it, I‚Äôm sure those wouldn‚Äôt have been insurmountable challenges, but we didn‚Äôt have enough time before graduation to get to a point where we were comfortable making these major decisions. So it fizzled out."
534,"B2 tourist visa, met by chance and were married within 6 months. We didn't see any reason not to."
535,"I'm a dual citizen with my birth country and USA. He was here on a B2 tourist visa. We currently live in a major US city.

The info below is outdated. You are only financially responsible if your ex spouse goes on government assistance. Then you must repay the government."
536,"In all honesty, I fucking hate his guts. He's treated her like absolute shit in the past. He says he changed but I don't believe that for one second. He's been there for months, and he can go a few days without hitting her up. I think he's a grade A douchebag. She deserves so much better.

She's going to a place where she knows only one person. She's literally uprooting her entire life for this idiot. I'm scared she'll be stuck in a foreign country with no friends or family, nowhere to go or at the very least a safe space for her. She barely speaks Spanish. This shit spells disaster. Also, I worry about her general safety while there. Colombia isn't exactly known as one of the safest countries in the world"
537,Thank you for the detailed response
538,"Not sure I understand the question.

Femininity is a social construct that is at best irrelevant to my life and at worst harmful."
539,Ron Swanson
540,"Femininity: qualities or attributes regarded as characteristics of women.

If Im understanding your question right, I would have to say my husband. After I met him I wanted to look more feminine. I was a single mother to a boy when I met him, so I felt like I had kinda let myself go in the  feminine aspect. Then when I met him I wanted to look more feminine for him. Also, growing up I felt I got stripped from femininity by my parents, out of fear that I may become pregnant or runaway with a man at an early age. Culture might play a role in this too. So, growing up being too feminine, meant you were a (three letter word). In my case anyway. Then I met my husband, and little late in life, but I now embrace femininity, afterall I am a woman."
541,Age redefined femininity for me. I used to think I needed to be a certain way. The older I get the less i feel like I need to meet others expectations.
542,You understand the question.
543,Curly girl method
544,Satin pillowcase helps me a lot but I‚Äôll always have some frizz if I didn‚Äôt shower that day. What helps the most is not touching my hair while it‚Äôs still wet and drying with a tshirt if I don‚Äôt air dry.
545,I use the fructis leave in conditioner it's in a lime green bottle.
546,Shea butter.
547,"I use leave in conditioner ( not a special product but my last step in the shower is to wring the water out of my hair then spread my normal conditioner on the ends, then leave that in and put my hair up in a towel turban for thirty minutes or so, then air dry.) I noticed less frizz overall once I started doing this last leave in conditioner step."
548,I live in South Carolina where the humidity is always at like 800%. I never have frizz free hair üòî
549,"Cold water rinse ever since I read about it in 17 magazine years ago. Not sure if it helps but it feels like it does! Also, curly hair gel."
550,Moisturize ur hair frequently with conditioners and creams. Shampoo less often and minimize applied heat
551,I braid mine before bed every night. I like the waviness the next day as well.
552,Be born with stick straight hair that holds no curl. I don't deal with frizz but I'm always envious of curly hair. Grass is always greener and all that jazz.
553,Curly hair here! Trader Joe‚Äôs hair serum followed by Camille rose  curl maker gel on wet/damp hair.
554,"I have curly hair, I just let it be, but if I touch it too much I just rock the ponytail with a halo of short baby hairs flying around."
555,i blow dry my hair using PowerDry.Me & use olaplex no. 7 after. nothing has ever eliminated my frizz like those two products.
556,I don‚Äôt.
557,"Living proof frizz line!!!!! Pricey, but WORKS & is good for your hair."
558,Just argan oil or hair oil. Not too much or it will get greasy and lose its volume. Only enough to to make things a little more.....graspy
559,Biosilk. Eliminates frizz AND smells great!!!
560,Anti-Frizz hair serum!!! Definitely makes a huge difference. A small quantity goes a long way especially if you apply like 2 drops to semi dry hair and then blow dry the rest of it. It's also great for heat styling.
561,Brazilian blowouts
562,Any kind of Hair Oil - I love OGX Miracle Coconut Penetrating Oil the most.
563,Marrakesh oil while it's still damp
564,Moroccan oil
565,Hahahahahahahahaha
566,Shave it
567,whats that?
568,Word
569,Give me more!!!
570,Another vote for this. Total game changer.
571,oh me too! By Garnier? Its a miracle worker for my ends
572,Same
573,Haha I feel you. I live in a pretty humid area as well
574,I read it works as well
575,That's absolutely true. What I envy about straight frizzless hair is that it always looks nice and it's also way more predictable than curly hair
576,Have you tried the Curly Girl Method?
577,Pretty sure my country doesn't sell the first product but can look if there are similar products
578,I did so as well. But then I cut my shart and now it doesn't fit into a ponytail anymore sadly
579,"Nice, I'm going to try that one as well then!"
580,Probably the most effective way
581,"So the curly girl method is basically just a big set of guidelines you follow to take care of your wavy and/or curly hair. It was created by a woman named Lorraine Massey, and she has a book outlining everything called the Curly Girl Handbook. There are tons of websites, YouTube videos and channels, and a subreddit where people can share advice, how they‚Äôre following the method, etc. The subreddit is r/curlyhair if you‚Äôre interested.

A lot of people who have really dry, frizzy, or poofy hair actually just have wavy or curly hair and don‚Äôt realize it. I‚Äôve always known I had curly hair but I didn‚Äôt know how to style it, and after following the method for a couple months, my hair has gotten super duper healthy and I get very little frizz."
582,Yup I love it!
583,Isn't that for women with curly hair? My hair is completely straight.
584,It's the only the that got rid of my frizz! I would use every oil and mask and protein treatment imaginable and none if it worked. I'm so grateful I found the CGM recently!
585,Thank you so much! Definately gonna check that out
586,"I am definitely in the group of people who actually have curly hair. But just like you did, I have no clue how to take care of it well. Did you try the full curly hair method or an adjusted version?"
587,[removed]
588,"Nope, it's for anyone who wants friz-free, shiny, healthy hair. And there are plenty of people on the sub that thought they had stick straight hair their whole lives until they tried the method to find that they do have wavy or even curly hair. Check it out! r/curlyhair"
589,This is quite relatable! So I'll definitely give it a try!

591,Check out the r/curlyhair info page. There's a beginner's guide and links to the wiki that covers everything.
592,"I think it‚Äôs unfair that girls are sexualised so early in life, and expected to change their behaviour due to their developing bodies - a lot of girls are barely pubescent when they first get told that they need to dress in a way that won‚Äôt draw attention to their bodies...why are girls aged 9/10/11/etc being told they need to prevent sexualisation when it‚Äôs adults who shouldn‚Äôt be sexualising them?"
593,"Girls are generally a lot more restricted in their pursuit of interests. Especially if those interests are deemed ""unladylike.""

Girls tend to be given more chores and other household responsibilities like watching over younger siblings.

There's a lot more expectations on physical appearance for girls. This is much more time consuming which takes time away from other interests. It also leads to girls and women being uncomfortable and dissatisfied with their bodies.

Women in general have to do a lot more to earn basic respect in both education and careers than men do.

No, none of this is justified."
594,"We expect girls to both be more calm and controlled, but also more emotionally expressive with feelings like sadness.

Girls are expected to participate in hosting events, cooking, cleaning, and general upkeep of a household.  Boys, if they do the same thing, are seen as doing something exceptional and worthy of praise.

Girls are expected to always consider the thoughts and feelings of others in regards to their behavior, clothing choices, actions, and words.

Women are expected to be the ""gatekeepers"" of sex, but also not really *be* sexual (at least until we're married).

Woman are expected to bear the emotional and mental burden of managing a household (and the people within it), remembering tasks that need done, delegating as possible, supplying the home with necessary items, keeping things tidy, making sure their partner isn't under too much stress, being the primary caregiver for any children (this often extends to pets as well), and managing everyone's schedules.

Woman are often expected to maintain a certain level of beauty, realistic or not, but never be anything but modest or self-depreciating about their looks.

Yes, I think people expect girls to be ""mature"" faster.  Yes, I think this impacts a person's development (male or female, since all these things have implications for boys growing up as well).

I do not think they are justified."
595,"Growing up under my grandmother is girls were expected to do the majority of the cleaning, cooking, and ""serving."" The boys weren't allowed to wash dishes, that was a girl chore. The girls weren't allowed to take out the trash. The girls were taught to be responsible very early on because we were expected to take care of everything and everyone. It was a very antiquated way if being raised and thankfully I've been able to establish different rules for my family."
596,"I read a study done on this in the late 70's that started with the reasoning starting just after birth where when the infant is first picked up the girls were cradled in the lap and coddled like something delicate, but the boys were often lifted up above the head and spoken to as if to an emerging warrior. I don't know if it's true but it struck a nerve with me back then and I've seen it happen in person. *shrug* I like to think things are changing now that we're more self-aware."
597,"No, they're not justified because boys are just as capable of taking on these responsibilities, or make it fair and allow girls to stay children for longer. I grew up with my older brother, so in my experience:  
  
* Learning and being expected to help with all house chores - all my brother did was taking the bin out and walking our dog, which I also did anyway;  
  
* He started going out earlier, staying out later, being allowed to travel for festivals, interrail, etc;  
  
* His sexuality was understood and supported instead of being a shameful thing or my mother worrying about his (and our family's) reputation;  
  
* I was well aware of all the things I couldn't do (ie, once I got into a water balloon fight and my mother was seething because my t-shirt got wet, I didn't even understand why at the time because I was just in middle school), friends I couldn't have, *male* friends being frowned upon if hanging out on our own, etc.  
  
* Having to be nice even in wildly uncomfortable situations because you're more easily seen as rude or catty;  
  
* Having my brother trying to be controlling and overprotective as well;  
  
* Having to be my mother's emotional support, which she never really expected from my brother because he was a boy.  
  
And probably more stuff I can't remember."
598,"Having been a teacher to very young kids, I could see how even at very young ages, you notice the girls have been socialised to be caring, more responsible for each other and each other's emotions, expected to pick up, tidy and clean their environment, in a way that boys definitely weren't expected to. The last point was always really obvious in my classroom. I made it a point every time we tidied up to call out the kids who weren't helping and openly discussing gendered expectations.

So is it any wonder that we have an imbalance when it comes to emotional labour and domestic chores in future life? 

Of course they're not justified but I think it's a really difficult thing to even notice. Most people do it completely subconsciously. There's a brilliant video somewhere where they dressed up some babies as the opposite gender to what you'd expect, and watched as volunteers picked toys for them to play with. When you asked volunteers why they picked for example the doll or the toy hoover or the cookery set, they say things like ""Oh I thought the baby seemed drawn to it"" or something like that. And when told actually that was a male baby, are you surprised, they were!"
599,This one makes me the angriest. Blaming children for grown men with flithy minds.
600,"Exactly. And then this gets translated into the whole bullshit ‚Äúgirls mature faster than boys‚Äù trope. Well what do you expect when you start sexualizing them before they are even old enough to understand what is happening, or why the fuck it is happening."
601,"I feel this, I started working out when I was 11 I think and remember before highschool I was in the middle of eating hamburger and my mom cut it in half and dumped a bunch of salt on one half and told me how it was her trick for portion control. Between then and Christmas I lost so much weight (I've never been close to overweight) that my friends mom asked if I was bulimic. 
One of the only reasons I hate family gatherings is because I'm usually the one told to set/clean the table while my brother sits and watches TV. I've also watched my grandmother with crippling arthritis make my perfectly capable grandfather every meal pretty much ever and I just want her to sit and knit and do her grandma things but I can't get her to because she's so determined to do her houselady things and thinks it's lazy and selfish for her to not do them"
602,I feel this 100%

605,"Southeastern USA, from the desserts to the BBQ to the mac n cheese, everything about it!"
606,I'm from the West coast of Canada but I would probably have to say the best food is in Quebec.
607,"In the US and I would have to say either New England (lobster! chowder!), Louisiana (everything Cajun!) or North Carolina barbeque"
608,"I'm in SoCal and I think we have pretty good food, but... I freaking love Southern food. Shrimp and grits, Nashville hot chicken sandwiches, chess pie, biscuits and gravy, etc. etc."
609,"I grew up and spent 26 years in Southern California, so I was spoiled to death with authentic Mexican and Tex Mex. I‚Äôm gonna have to say the Southwest, for sure.

I no longer live in CA but I daydream about the food A LOT."

611,"I‚Äôve only ever lived in Illinois and California, but my parents lived in Texas for 15 years, and Texan food is the bomb. I drool thinking about the barbecue I‚Äôve eaten in Texas...and my dad makes the best chili, hands down."
612,"In my opinion, Austin and Portland."
613,"(A virginia girl here)

The South - from the Carolinas down to Texas. Real shoutout to Louisiana tho - Cajun food hits different.
Plus Bananas Foster. Yummmmm"

621,My whole country has the best food
622,I guess the capital city?

634,True! I'm biased because I'm also not a big seafood fan!
635,Seriously! It‚Äôs so good. I haven‚Äôt been to La Golondrina‚Äôs but I am putting it on my list for when I go back and visit! Thanks for the recommendation. Thankfully my parents still live in SoCal so it‚Äôs reason enough to go back often.
636,"Actually i'm french, but half of my favorite foods are italian"
637,"Of course! It‚Äôs in a really touristy area because it‚Äôs on Olvera street, but I think it‚Äôs definitely worth the crowd :D their elotes alone make me weep ‚ù§Ô∏è I hope you‚Äôll get to visit after this pandemic goes away!"

639,"And it's Paris. It's not even the main food city in France, the first is Lyon.
And there is delicious speciality everywhere ^^"

642,"Hey OP.

literally nobody in the world is basing their decision whether or not to have sex with someone on how good they are at opening jars."
643,Why are men so obsessed with opening jars? It‚Äôs not that hard.
644,"if a man cannot open a jar he must be culled immediately, only the strongest wrists can survive"
645,"here's a list of all the packages I've opened today:

- a bottle of medication
- a bottle of vitamins
- a resuable water bottle if that counts
- an amazon bag
- a new set of screwdrivers
- alcohol wipes
- a new thing of shampoo 
- a protein bar
- a bag of rice
- a can of vegetable soup
- a thing of crackers 
- a box of mac and cheese
- a box of screws
- a fidget cube I bought a bought a couple of months ago and just found in a drawer"
646,"I mean, I‚Äôd be pretty concerned if they couldn‚Äôt, barring some sort of disability. It seems like that‚Äôs just something you should be able to do? This isn‚Äôt a problem I‚Äôve had for myself or my husband."
647,"It would probably be pretty inconvenient for them if they couldn't, it's not very hard."
648,"it's important for all able-bodied adults to be able to open the packages for things they need or want, so very?

unless he never needs any goods I suppose"
649,"To me?  Zero.

To them?  Makes life easier"
650,"I have RA and I‚Äôm quickly losing my fine motor skills. My grip is pretty much non existent. So if I was shopping for a new partner it‚Äôs definitely on my long list of requirements. 

But if I wasn‚Äôt half a cripple? It wouldn‚Äôt even occur to me that it was a thing."
651,God I love this sub sometimes.
652,"I can open my own stuff so so should a man be able to, as well."
653,Zero percent. I was single for a long time and managed just fine on my own.
654,"Well, I opened several packets and jars all by myself today #proud so no it's not important, OP. 

Although I'd be concerned about them if they literally can't open any form of packaging. Like, why not? Is it a disability thing, or a snobby thing? Are they not able to use scissors?"
655,"..... why is this important to know? 

Anyone should be able to open packages or containers."
656,Not very. I rely on gadgets for that.
657,"I've managed to do all that shit for myself, so he should be able to manage it all for himself."
658,"Not remotely important. I open all my own stuff. I want a partner, not a servant."
659,"Very important. It's also very important for women and people of any gender to open packages, because presumably anybody in even a mildly developed country will encounter at least one packaged or canned item in the course of their lifetime."
660,"*raises eyebrows in lesbian*

I have literally never come across a jar that I could not open by some method or another."
661,"If he's opening it for himself, he should be able to do it, just like everything else he should be able to do for himself. If I can open a jar, your weak ass should."
662,Fairly important because most of the time I can‚Äôt and we would be wasting a lot of stuff.
663,Basically the least important thing ever.
664,"It's nice to have a fresh wrist/fingers to give it a go. Not a decision maker in and of itself. Just a demonstration of ingenuity to get done.

I'd be more concerned if he thought that was a deal breaker subject."
665,Very.  I have weak arms.
666,Could not give less of a shit. I'm quite capable of opening my own jars.
667,"Depends on whether or not he needs what's in it. If he does, then it's pretty important."
668,"Not important at all, but pretty practical."

670,My wife said she only married me for my tools.
671,It‚Äôs not really about the jars. It‚Äôs about the feeling they get when they know a woman is dependent on them.

Honestly, I don't get it. Some things are just hard to open, most are not. Especially with jars you can just release the vacuum and everything's fine."

675,It‚Äôs kind of funny that opening jars is the only thing they think they‚Äôre useful for tho
676,gross haha
677,"As a lesbian, I agree."
678,It really is. Honestly a lot of aspects of male culture are pretty gross and controlling. Obligatory nOt alL mEn but come on.
679,"yeah seriously. Can't imagine wanting a partner who depends on me, it's just so foreign to me to want a relationship not between equals"
680,"Well, I‚Äôm a domme so I can see the appeal haha but that‚Äôs only in one area of a relationship to be fair. As a foundational thing, y‚Äôall do need to be equals."
681,"haha that's fair. I kind of get it in bed even if it's not what I am into, but yeah like.. as a 24/7 thing, and where it must be gendered, too? No. Plus like... itr's one thing if you want to give your partner permission to orgasm, another if your partner needs you to EAT or otherwise function.

682,"Haha I‚Äôm contrarian, I‚Äôve always gotta disagree. Sorry! But yeah it‚Äôs stupidly weird, honestly. I don‚Äôt know how straight women do it tbh."
683,"I think its because for so long a time, in western, mideastern and chinese culture, women depended on men. To where men nowadays still live in that time mentally, and they dont feel right if its not the case."
684,"yeah me neither. I don't think I'd be happy on either side of it, but the men at least get to grow up. So much of like.. traditional femininity, in a hetero context, is about maintaining a state of perpetual adolescence. It's weird and off-putting."
685,Yes congratulations on discovering that sexism existed and continues to exist.

688,"I take my earrings out every day, but I don't think I have ever washed them. New quarantine activity I guess."
689,"For me.. the question should be ‚ÄúHow often do you actually put your earrings on?‚Äù Lol 

I wash them every month with rubbing alcohol."
690,"I can't sleep with earrings in, so I take them out every night. I wash my ear holes in the shower and my earrings get antibacterial wiped every couple of days before I stick em in."
691,"I don't take my jewelry out to wash my piercings, I wash them every time I take a shower.

I have some piercings that are still healing, I wash those 3x daily with sterile saline and use qtips to get the crusties off."
692,My jewelry is really difficult to take out (and it's recommended only done by a piercer). I wash/clean them best I can while in my skin. Pushing it around a bit and spinning it around still enables me to get every part of the surface.
693,I keep all of my piercings in but I do take my earrings out to wash them every once in a while (like when they start to smell LOL). Otherwise they stay in 24/7
694,I sometimes take them off when I go to sleep - unless they're small hoops or studs - and I take them out and wash them before taking a shower/washing my hair.
695,"I wear stainless steel post earrings ~95% of the time because without them, my earring holes close up. I‚Äôve had my ears pierced three times! In the same spot. 

I only take these out occasionally for no particular reason at all."
696,"I can't sleep with earrings on, I have to take them out every day.  
  
When I had more (upper lobe and helix) than just standard lobe earrings I waited until they fully healed and then took them off every night as well."
697,"My diamond studs only come out once a year for their annual inspection and cleaning.    
Others are changed as whim or outfits dictate but the studs stay in 24/7."
698,I'll give my earrings a quick rinse when I change them out. Which can be once a week for very lightweight studs or every night for heavier pieces.
699,"I take my earrings out every day when I get home. I wash them once a month or so, unless I drop them in which case I wash them immediately.

I have a ton of earrings, so more often than that would be a bit impractical üòÖ"
700,"Every once and awhile I take them out and put them in a cup with salt, then pour boiling water over them and swirl the cup around. Then I'll clean the pierced hole and sometimes put Neosporin around it so it gets a dose of antibacterial stuff"
701,"I always take my earings off before bed. I don't wash them, but every so often (maybe after 10 wearings) I'll rub neosporin on the earing before putting it through my ear to disinfect it. Sometimes the earing starts to feel sting-y after wearing it so many times, and this usually resets it and soothes the ear."
702,I don't. I wash my face and head in the shower and they get clean in the process.
703,I once didn‚Äôt take out all six of my ear piercings for three years. Recently my ears have started to itch more (they‚Äôre sensitive to some metals) because I switched out my really nice earrings with cheaper ones after losing them doing gymnastics. Now I‚Äôm going without earrings for a bit
704,I either take them out when I sleep or wear small loops to bed.
705,"I only tale of the earrings if they bother my in my sleep,other than that I dont really take it out if the earrings are nice. Mine don't rust in the water so I just wear it most of the time. Only time I take it out is to change it or it is uncomfy when I sleep."
706,"My ears are stretched on top of being extra sensitive to earrings, so I take them out and wash them every time I shower"
707,"I take my earrings off every night, hate getting poked in the head. I often forget to put them back in lol

Perhaps because of this, I very rarely find a need to clean them."
708,"I leave them in if they're studs or my industrial bar, and those I rinse with tap water. Used to twice a week, now I don't bother. As long as they look fine it's all good."
709,"I take my earlobe piercings out once a week when I wash my hair. I'm currently stretching the bottom holes so they're a bit angrier and producing more sebum in response. I may or may not start taking my helix out when it eventually heals, it's small enough it's not currently presenting a problem and I just give it a quick rub with a cotton swab dampened with saline solution.

Otherwise everything stays in because I don't want the holes to shrink (bottom holes at 8g, second holes at 12g)."
710,"I wash around my lobe piercings (two sets) with a very gentle soap. I don't take the earrings out unless I'm going to put new ones in immediately.

Rook: never. I had it changed once at the piercing shop. I don't touch it myself as it's not fully healed. I just wash around the general area, very carefully."
711,"I take my earrings (double pierced lobes and one cartilage) out every night, but leave my nose stud in. I take it out before every shower so I can clean my face better and just rinse it with water before putting it back in. Never had any issues with infections."
712,When they get infected and painful/itchy. Otherwise I leave the majority in and only change out the ones lowest on my lobes for different pairs to feel fashionable sometimes.
713,"i take out and clean my nose hoop weekly! it's an actually an earring tht fits my nose like it was made for it, but because it's an earring and not a nose ring, i'm extra careful with it. 

my cartilage i don't remove yet bc it's still healing & my earrings i take out daily bc it bugs me to sleep on them."
714,"I found out too late that I'm allergic to most kinds of earrings, so I ended up with a pair of sleep-friendly ones with rounded backers that I leave in 24/7. Is cleaning earrings a thing? I figured they would just get cleaned in the shower... Now I feel gross."
715,"I only own statement earrings, they come off as soon as I get home. I clean them with alcohol before I put them in."
716,"I use a qtip with contact solution to clean my piercings once a week. (Ears, lip, and nose) I leave them in while I clean them. For years, I only have taken them out one time for a few hours because I had to for an X-ray."
717,I dont take my septum out or wash it.
718,"I have about a dozen non traditional piercings (nose, trague, daith, rook etc.) and for those I leave the jewelry in always. However, I did specifically spend a lot of extra money to buy jewelry that is meant to stay in those piercings at all times. For my first lobe piercings I have a pair of smallish hoops that I leave in and change out if I want something fancier."
719,"I wash them in the shower. The lowest/front pair of earrings does get taken out and washed with soap after each day of wear, plus I use a silver polishing cloth on all my jewelry every so often."
720,Earrings out every night. I wash them if they are looking tired. I tie my hair back fairly tightly though. I also rarely wear the same pair more than once a month
721,"I use to never take them off until I realize they started smelling, so now I let them sit in alcohol every week over night, but usually by the third or fourth day the smell would start coming back but that's just me"
722,"If they're studs, i take them out and wash them every time before i shower (which is every other day or so) but i do sleep with them in my ears. If they're dangly ones, i take them out every night before sleep and only clean then like once a week or so."
723,"I have an industrial and I have never taken it off it's still healing, going on 1 year and a few months. 


As for regular earrings, I don't really wear them lol But, when I do, I make sure to get the gunk out of the holes, I clean my lobes with alcohol, then put the earrings on. Then, I take them off as soon as I get home, and I normally wash them with alcohol right after. Again, I never wear earrings, so they tend to be stinky sometimes lol"
724,"I can't take out my dermal anchor, but I clean around it every two days. Same for my nostril ring and helix. I take the earrings out almost every day though, they get irritated pretty quickly."
725,"Standard earrings are removed at the end of the day. Any other piercings are washed and rotated as needed in the shower, but rarely fully removed"
726,No way do I leave earrings. It‚Äôs disgusting if you never remove and clean them. You need to clean and wash everyday. I mean when you‚Äôre healing and can‚Äôt remove just make sure to get alcohol everywhere to sanitize and clean but once you‚Äôre fully healed you should take the time and clean yourself.
727,That‚Äôs what happened to me they stink like shit
728,You should not put alcohol on a piercing. It dries the skin and causes irritation. The only thing you should ever put directly on a healing piercing is clean water or sterile saline.
729,If you use high quality jewelry this is less likely to happen.
730,I had absolutely zero issues when I used alcohol on my newly pierced ears.
731,No mine is like 5‚Ç¨ for 20 pieces üòÇ
732,"Good for you, but that's just you. Piercing professionals and doctors advise against it."

734,"Warm weather, bbqs, swimming."
735,This is so stupid but pottering about bare foot and not getting cold feet. I hate having cold feet but it‚Äôs not a problem in summer.
736,"The beach; it‚Äôs my happy place. Give me beach weather, a good blanket, an umbrella, a cooler full of drinks and food, music, and a good book (or two) and I will just be my most relaxed, stress free self. I am so going to need that this summer."

747,Going out on the lake with some good friends and just relaxing.
748,"Coming out of a long rainy season (pnw) and spending more time outside. We moved out of the city and into the mountains last year, I can't wait to lounge on a blanket and listen to the birds while my kids play while my hubby bbq's something yummy and serves me scratch margaritas. üòé"
749,Mangoes and cherries.
750,Summer showers. I live in florida where it rains around 4pm nearly everyday during the summer.
751,"I hate summer with a passion. The heat, the brightness. It is the worst. I literally hunker down with the shades drawn and AC on full blast until October."

770,"Camping, I love the ability to temporarily run away from my problems"

772,"Swimming, going to the beach, trying on new bikinis, and tanning."
773,"Kayaking, taking the dogs and the kiddo for walks along the river, and car shows (if we can have them this year). And not having to wear socks. I'm so glad I bought some new flip flops before all the lockdowns started!"
774,Bare shoulders!
775,"Going to the beach. (Back home, I'd get to go to the ocean once or twice, plus there was a small lake in town I could go to, weather and time permitting. Now, I go up to Lake Erie *almost* every weekend in the summer. I miss the ocean, but this will do.)"
776,"my tan skin, mangos with tajin, a nice cold alcoholic drink, and lots and lots of time in the water/by the pool"
777,"Beer, sunsets, watching/going to Brewers baseball games, wearing sandals, playing soccer, longboarding"
778,Ultimate frisbee season. Days out by the lake. Pride. Wearing tanks and shorts every day.
779,My freckles pop out and give my cheekbones a natural contouring
780,Wearing a bikini üëô
781,During the summer DQ usually brings back the cotton candy blizzard. I‚Äôve look forward to this since I was like 8.

798,"* Not being cold.
* To feel the sun on my skin.
* Swimming."
799,dildo
800,"Que sea oto√±o o invierno, de donde soy aqu√≠ el clima es muy caluroso y no me gusta el sol.
Prefiero m√°s el oto√±o e invierno :)"
801,"Lots of time spent outside: hiking, climbing, camping, long bike rides, sitting on a bench in the park reading, beer or coffee on patios, outdoor swimming pools, etc. Ice cream and iced coffees (I'm almost always cold, so I can't really have them in the colder months). Sandals and lots of bare skin. Not being cold!"
802,YESSSS!! I lovee itt! The whole no bra just a flowy dress and nice sandals! It just makes me so happy
803,Yes.
804,"Amen, sister. Just reading this put a smile on my face. Blessed to live in FL where I can do this for the greater part of the year üå¥‚òÄÔ∏èüí¶"
805,My mouth is watering at the thought of a ripe watermelon now. I will literally eat it until I'm sick when it comes into season. Mmmmmm.
806,All year I crave farmers market strawberries and peaches. The store bought ones just aren‚Äôt the same
807,Muscat grapes. I get sad every August when they go out of season
808,What are summer bodies?
809,Right there with you
810,Do you think with seeds or seedless taste better?
811,"Sorry lmao, that was a bit of a broad term. For me at least and depending on where I live now, I mean tanned, vibrant, flawless (not too many bumps or acne), and even like abs and stuff if I am working out.üòäüëçüèº"
812,"Yes, in martial arts. He got really pissy and deliberately hurt me and used excess force the next time we sparred."
813,"I don't really consider bowling to be a serious competitive sport, but dang do some men get butthurt when they lose. Pretty funny."
814,"Yes, climbing trees. Blames that I only won because I'm lighter..... Don't care, still wonüí™"
815,He pouted and said he didn't want to play anymore because it just wasn't fun. I was also inebriated at the time. I found it funny. Still do.
816,"Oh yeah I do sometimes in smash bros. Most take it fiiine tho one guy I remember came up to my opponent and said ""ok I play you,"" and my opponent said, ""No, I lost"" and he followed up with ""Whaaaat? You lost to a girl???""

Same guy made fun of a sexual assault victim before so I wasn't surprised but fuck i hate him.


Edit: oh I guess the time I won in a casual event is probably the most like what you were asking for. It wasn't competitive at all though everyone was trying their best. First he told me ""I'm mad you're better than your boyfriend"" and I was just ????
Then when we beat him and his friend (doubles) he slammed his controller down and yelled and scared the shit out of me.

At again, a casual event with no prizes."
817,My husband still can‚Äôt beat  me at air hockey...I think the time that hurt the most was when I was 8 months pregnant and still won...but he claims that time wasn‚Äôt fair cuz it was two against one.
818,"Yes, pretty frequently actually.

One or two reacted like a baby.  One reacted with violence.

Most are just like ""...woah"""
819,"This guy took me on a date to an arcade bar. All of the classics. Street fighter, Pacman, Mario, Galaga, Duck Hunt, I don't know name em, they had em. I beat him at almosssst everything and before we left he told me he had fallen in love with me."
820,"Sure, I played on boys' sports teams as a kid. I still enjoy competing against guys. It's never been a problem."
821,"Yes I was always a faster runner in school and had better stamina then all the boys. Sadly, internalized misogyny got me as I felt guilty for making the boys feel bad and so I stopped trying and gave up."
822,My football team won against the men's team once and I've won against a fair few men in shooting. They've always reacted fine.
823,"For sure. I was a cross-country runner for 8 years and was faster than some of the guys on my team. They were fine with it, because that‚Äôs the nature of the sport- a lot of people will be better than you at running because there are so many competitors."
824,"While fighting may or may not count as a competitive sport/activity, I think it applies enough here for me to share my answer. 

I was hanging out with my younger brother, and one of the known bullies walked up, his friends were out and he was bored, which is a stupid reason to pick a fight but he‚Äôs not the brightest, I kicked his ass pretty quickly.

He‚Äôs known to harass women all throughout my school, knowing it‚Äôs rare for them to fight back, but he‚Äôs a coward who only does it around his friends, if he did the same to any normal boy they probably wouldn‚Äôt either if they were surrounded by his mates.

After it, he was on the ground, all I had was a sore wrist, he just sat there for a couple minutes opening and closing his mouth in shock like a fish- it was one of the best feelings I‚Äôve ever experienced to be honest-

Actually, I felt fucking *awesome*"
825,"Not serious but darts. We were both pretty drunk but I‚Äôm super competitive and so was he. Anyways, he was hyping himself up and I told him to go first and count up the points then I went. I doubled his score and got two bullseyes. He got pissed and said it was all bullshit anyways and I didn‚Äôt deserve to win."
826,at swimming in school i was faster than everyone. the reaction from the boys was stunned bewilderment.
827,"Not serious but back in middle school, I was on  a local basketball team. I loved it and was my coach‚Äôs secret weapon for eliminating certain players, as I was an intense man-to-man player. 

One day in gym, they let the girls class play the boys in a game. I was playing like I did for my team and getting up in some of the guys faces and stealing the ball from them (not fouling mind you). One of the guys got so mad at me for it that he grabbed me by the throat and picked me up. Called me a bitch and asked what the hell was wrong with me. 

Being the hyper aggressive wild child I was, I just egged him on about essentially being a sore loser. Boys‚Äô teacher broke it up, and that was that."
828,"Yeah during tennis I beat this guy while we were playing a practice match. We warmed up first and you could yell hr wasn't serious so I won the first game, but he got mad and played more seriously. Then he started to lose even though he was trying seriously and I eventually won the set. He was mad because he thought that he was the better tennis player but the results speak for them self."
829,"My ex-boyfriend used to play poker regularly with a bunch of our guy friends. I wasn't really interested as card games are kind of boring to me. Until they got all shitty about ""it's guy's night, eww no girls allowed, we're going to fart and smoke cigars, why don't you stay home and clean the kitchen."" 

Then they needed another player and they came crawling to me. I'm no expert poker player but I know those guys and they were ridiculously easy to read, so I just kept winning. We kept going. They all of a sudden started saying that the pot wasn't ""real"" money and everyone just took their money home at the end, it was just for fun, etc. It had never been true in the past. I won in the end and they absolutely lost their minds. They ""jokingly"" accused me of cheating, and refused to let me take the winnings home (as had literally always happened in the past).

Later, they blamed it on me ""manipulating"" them and that they had been drinking, and that it wasn't ""fun"" if women were invited, etc. I never was ""allowed"" to play again."
830,Does air hockey count? He was a pretty good sport.
831,"I have many times in serious solo sports but only ever in fun competition which they were proud of me for


The serious competitions I won awards for were always against other girls"
832,"Not really a serious competitive activity but I‚Äôll say it anyway. My ex flounced out of the pool and refused to set foot in it again for the rest of our holiday because I beat him three out of three times in a race. He kept saying I had an unfair advantage or that he was letting me win. Sure, dude. Or else I‚Äôm just better at swimming than you and you can‚Äôt admit it üòÄ

Also every time I‚Äôve taught a dude how to play tennis. They think they‚Äôll automatically be amazing at it because penis. Your upper body strength isn‚Äôt going to make up for a lack of technique or strategy, my dear friend. I always beat them and they get so mad and never want to play tennis again."
833,"Yep, been there."
834,All BJJ women all share the same experience.  Tapping a guy with an ego only for them to get angwy.
835,Wow! Smashing controllers and yelling is definitely the kind of thing you'd expect in a casual game of Smash Bros!!
836,"Fair point, I guess?"
837,Aaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! Ain't that cute?
838,I always found weird how some people who aren't even trying get all crazy when they lose
839,[removed]
840,"If both of you were trying, sure! Why not?"
841,"I mean, of course I can swim better than you, but only if water temperature is an even number"
842,"Same here. I tapped a guy in BJJ and he got so upset that the next time we rolled, he held a heel hook even after I tapped and tore my mcl."
843,"Yup! When I was a fresh blue belt, I had a guy in an armbar from bottom and was trying to show him how to stack me and slip his arm out. He said, ‚Äúno, how about this?‚Äù grabbed my gi, picked me up and slammed me against the wall head first, then fell over...and I still had him in an armbar. I cranked it then. 

I try to be nice to new guys who walk into the gym (put chokes on slow, don‚Äôt crank submissions)...but too many of them decide after the first couple subs that this is some sort of insult to their masculinity rather than a testament to how effective jiu jitsu is."
844,It wasn't the kind of fun yelling or ribbing or anything but a guttural scream and getting up in anger that triggered my fight or flight response immediately (I froze) and made everyone else look up.
845,I have been absolutely curve stomped by my girlfriend at other games and honestly it‚Äôs the funnest thing when she starts trash talking! Sorry not really related just miss her due to the quarantine.

847,"Woot, woot! I totally played off the fact that I threw out my elbow."
848,"He claimed it was unfair because he was fat and I wasn‚Äôt. If he was in better shape, he TOTALLY would have beat me. You mean to say that people in good shape are typically better at sports than people who aren‚Äôt? Colour me shocked! Funny how he‚Äôd constantly bring up all the times he beat me at things (lifting weights) and use it as proof that men are superior to women but every time I mentioned that I‚Äôve beat him at everything from tennis to Mario Kart, he‚Äôd flounce off in a sulk and claim that those things are ‚Äúfor women and gays‚Äù anyway so it doesn‚Äôt count. Nobody likes a sore loser :D"
849,"What the fuck is wrong with males. Did you mcl heal ok? 
I guess the trick is to beat them and DON'T give them the opportunity to retaliate."
850,DId he throw it into the same trash bag where he put his pride?
851,It healed just fine after four weeks. Took him longer than that to get the wiring in his jaw taken out.
852,You injured his jaw!? You go girl
853,"As soon as he let go, I mounted him and started elbowing him in the face. I've still got the scar on my elbow from where I got snagged with a broken tooth."
854,"YESSSS!!! YOU GO üíØ
Gotta teach them they can't abuse or bully us. Reminds me of the time I was taking self defense classes. I told my male relative about them and he immediately tried to spar with me and show me that he could overpower me if he wanted to. His tune changed when his eye got injured in front of everyone and he felt humiliated :)"
855,"It's a running joke in my family that the girls are brought up to be tougher than the boys, since we were made to do the same things. I grew up sharing a room with one of my brothers and we'd fight constantly. He's 6'4"" and 240 lbs, but we still duke it out from time to time, despite being fully grown adults. Honestly, the only time we didn't fight is when I was pregnant."
856,be intense! be proud of yourself and intimidate your enemies!
857,"Takes self-awareness. 
There are times when you may be feeling intensely, but it may serve you to keep a lid on it. Also, being able to ""feel people out"" helps. Some can handle it, some cannot."
858,A good song and a joint.
859,"For me it was learning to *listen*. Not just so you know what you wanna say next, no, really listen and ask follow up questions to what others are saying."
860,Weed
861,"Legit question: Why do you want to tone down your awesomeness?

&#x200B;

I can be intense as hell. I see that as a positive part of my personality."
862,I used to be intense. But life beat me up and I care a lot less about almost everything.
863,"People who come across as too intense usually are not good at allowing for a little ebb and flow in their interactions with other people. They're bad at allowing space for differing opinions, and tend to hold monologues at people, not dialogues with people. They wait to talk instead of actively listen.

A good conversation can be like a little story that you and the other person create together; it's a journey from an idea to a collective understanding. It's not a competition where you're right and the other person needs to agree."
864,"Never stop being intense. The second you do, people will assume you‚Äôre weak, take your kindness for ignorance, and attempt to fuck you over at every turn.

I know it‚Äôs a jaded way of thinking, but trust me, I speak from experience. It‚Äôs much better on this side of the river."
865,"I got really tired of being told I was ""too much"" and started just being me. If people don't like it, they don't have to be near me."
866,"I find positive outlets for it like my career, working out, hobby projects, planning parties, martial arts, sports, continuing education, perfecting cooking techniques... If the itch gets scratched in those ways, it won‚Äôt come out in unhealthy avenues like my relationships or conversations."
867,[deleted]
868,"For me, it's working on discerning what is and is not within my control, and letting go of the stuff that isn't. Discerning what *is* my responsibility, and what is *not*. It's a process, but it helps to dial down the stress, which in turn helps to keep me from lashing out or being a grouch."
869,"Just kind of realizing, I've always been a super intense person since I was a kid. It feels like I always have to be ""on"", and never can dial anything back. I know in my life this shows a lot. 

To put it simply - I always exist in a state of intensity. Like you can feel it. I'm always a blazing pit of intensity. Like I'm always Super Saiyan. 

I don't know if anyone's felt this way before, but I wonder how you all deal with it if you're similar."
870,Smoke pot or eat an edible
871,Weed and exercise. Lots of both. Run it off and then chill out.
872,Fuck that. Hang around people that admire your passion rather than try to stifle it.
873,Vodka and exercise. Poop yourself out so you don‚Äôt have the energy to deal with things haha.
874,"Exercise, wine, meditate, be in a non competitive situation."
875,"Let life sucked the joy right out of you. It worked for me. Seriously though, introspection and being thoughtful/aware of what comes out of your mouth or what actions you‚Äôre about to perform before you say/do it. Trust me, this saves you from thinking back on cringey things you said/did at 2 in the morning five years from now. Seriously though, I used to be bubbly and intense, life sucked the joy out of me."
876,Get high
877,Why wouldn't I want to be intense it's just who I am I have never wanted to be less intense
878,Never tone yourself down to please other people
879,"Learning people don't actually care about what you have to say. It really humbles you and makes you realize most things just aren't worth wasting your breath on. 
That, and also by FORCING myself to stay quiet. I've gotten into sticky situations that I could've easily avoided if I hadn't been so hotheaded about voicing my opinions."
880,this is the right answer
881,"Yep, I gave up giving a"
882,Haha unfortunately life and job means I can't partake
883,"I feel you. 

I don't have a sense of humor, and I've never been a funny person so I decided to quite while I was ahead."
884,"Age helped me build self awareness. Didn‚Äôt change my intensity but my ability to either for more in control of it or to know how to address it when it‚Äôs there at the right time. That said, it still totally gets me in trouble with a certain type of super passive person."
885,not much of an option for me..
886,Then I will pray for you lol
887,"When I was 17 I was homeless and was sitting on the sidewalk outside of a restaurant with a sign that said ""I Love Leftovers."" (Please don't judge, I had very few life skills and was just trying to survive.)

The restaurant was right next to a bar and this man came out and said hello, and asked if he could sit next to me and chat. I said sure, but thought it was weird because even with all the kindness I'd been shown before, when you're homeless no one really treats you like a person. 

So this guy sits down next to me and starts asking me about how I'm doing and why I'm homeless. He told me that he was at the bar with friends for his ""bachelor's party"" but they were all getting drunk and hitting on chicks and he didn't want to do either of those things. 

He asked me what I needed and of course I just told him food because even though I needed a lot of stuff I would never say more than just food. He looked at me and goes, ""Okay, but what else do you need?"" I finally told him that new socks and a first aid kit were always nice to have. He said that he had that stuff at home, and if I met him in the same place the next day he would have it for me. I thanked him and he went back to the bar.

I didn't expect him to actually return because honestly it's extremely common to have people ask what you need, say they're going to go get it, and never come back. Either way I returned the next day at the time he said and he had a brand new military backpack for me (he was in the military and had noticed my backpack was torn) a pack of socks, a first aid kit, and food. 

One of the coolest things was that when we had been chatting I casually mentioned that it would be cool to go to the local jazz festival that was going on. And this guy bought me a ticket! 

The thing I remember most about that entire interaction, however, wasn't the material things he got me. It was being treated like a human being. Homelessness is extremely dehumanizing and demoralizing, and this guy just totally treated me like a friend. So kind, so amazing. People truly are kind."
888,"I was in the ER as a danger to myself after opening up to my student counselor about feeling suicidal (I was very naive back then. They did nothing to actually help me get better, only scare me into not mentioning it again).

Was locked in a small room with nothing but a bed and a try for food. No tv, no counters, nothing else, for about 8 hours. No one told me what was going on or what would happen to me. I remember a few hours in just breaking down crying feeling so alone. The guard watching me felt bad, said he couldn't sit there and watch me cry.

He started talking to me about all sorts of random stuff and got my mind off my situation for a moment. That guy was an angel in a very dark time. I'll never forget his simple gesture of reaching out when everyone else treated me coldly like I was some kind of criminal."
889,"A couple I was phenomenally rude to and borderline aggressive with, managed to see past all of that and adopted me. 14 years as their adoptive daughter in two months.

I was in an extremely bad place then. My blood parents - who'd been lovely when I was what they wanted me to be, and switched on me when I deviated - had made me very lost. If they had hurt me, what hope could I have in the kindness of people who didn't even know me, right? Even the government people taking care of me were only doing it because it was their job.

They put up with all of it with good grace, which made me even angrier and more desperate to drive them away; but it eventually sunk in that they wouldn't have kept coming to see me if they weren't genuinely interested in adopting me. As long as I'm alive on God's green earth I would do anything for them; as they put so much work into me that I have an impossible debt to pay.

I'll stop before this gets mawkish but they saved my life. If that's not a 'memorable act of kindness', what is?"
890,I watched my 4 year old daughter compliment a lady who in all honestly looked like a mess she had clearly been crying her hair was a greasy mess in a bun that was clearly intended to hide that it hadn't been brushed in a couple days and these plain old flip flops. My daughter loved buns and flip flops they were the it style for her at the time so she said hi to her and just had to tell her how pretty her hair was and how awesome her flip flops were. She said it with such conviction that you could see this ladies mood perking up. She walked out of that store with something in her step that most assuredly was not there before (I had noticed her walking around the store before we got to the checkouts). I really think my daughter did something really good that day and I hope that lady has had many better days since then. I was one hell of a proud mom that day. I swear my daughter knew something was wrong with that lady too it wasn't just a fascination with her bun and flip flops because when we got to the car she said something about how the lady was sad and then she wasn't.
891,"A compliment from a stranger. I was walking and a teenage boy out with a couple of his female friends walked by and said my hair looked nice. 

It's such a small thing, but I was in such a negative place in my life that it almost brought me to tears. A compliment from a stranger that I had never seen before, probably would never see again, and who stood to gain absolutely nothing."
892,"I did much of the first part of my chemo regimen while my husband was away. So, I had two kids to feed and all of the chemo illness with which to deal. I ended up at a local diner early one morning before the kids had school because there were  just no groceries left.  The kids got whatever they want, and I just had hot water with lemon and some toast. When I went to pay, someone had paid the bill.  I cried all the way to the school and then all the way to the grocery store. 
I still think of that person regularly; I wish I could thank them."
893,"This happened today, actually.

A doctor took out his frustration on me today because he couldn't figure out how to use Zoom  to do a telehealth visit for his patients and pretty much told me that it was my fault, as I was staying on the line to help him troubleshoot some errors. He also said some things that aren't worth repeating, but extremely hurtful. I had a nervous breakdown later on after I got off the call with him.

One of my co-worker saw everything happen. She messaged me and said ""I just wanted you to know that you remained friendly and professional, despite him being a huge jerk. You don't deserve that kind of treatment and I'm always here for you if you need absolutely anything. Your hard work doesn't go unnoticed at all."" She also mentioned this at a meeting that we had later on and the amount of support that I had from my team was amazing. 

It was a small gesture, but I couldn't thank her enough today."
894,"I had just moved to a new country for my studies. Maybe three weeks in, I was buying some milk and realized I had no cash on me. I tries using my card, but it didn't work. So, I told the cashier I will come back for it later, and left the store. As I was getting out, a stranger walked up to me. She told me she saw what happened, and offered to pay for the milk."
895,"Today, actually. I got a flat tire on my way to work and didn‚Äôt know until I went to leave for my lunch break and saw it. A man that works in the same building that I have problems with (different story) used his portable compressor and put air in my tire so that I could take it somewhere to get it plugged. I didn‚Äôt even know. I just walked outside after clocking out and he was doing it."
896,"Over the holiday season I had two jobs at the same mall as an assistant manager. I had decided that I was dropping out of college and I needed to pay the bills. It was exactly one week before Christmas and I was exhausted. I opened and closed at the mall nearly every day. Somehow, I was scheduled to work 7 hours straight, alone, at one of my jobs. This included accepting deliveries, helping customers find product, stocking, and running the register. It was absolute madness. I had never been so stressed in my life, while also trying to give the best customer service. I was sweating and shaking. Most of the customers were understanding, but some definitely weren‚Äôt. It was very obvious that I was overwhelmed, and after an older lady made her purchase, she handed me $5 and told me to buy myself a coffee. I was absolutely floored by her kindness. After my shift, I was set to close at my other job. My other boss really cared about me, and on more than one occasion that season, she would tell me to go home and not worry about my shift. I surely had a guardian angel watching over me."
897,I got the news my dog had passed and after balling my eyes out I went for a drive to Dutch bro‚Äôs and the barista could tell I‚Äôve been crying from red puffy eyes and he drew flowers with hearts and wrote ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a LIGHT in my life!‚Äù And handed me a single sunflower with my coffee free of charge. I cried some more after that because it was so sweet ‚ù§Ô∏è
898,"I don't get too many acts of kindness, but once I was carrying many, many large packages. As in a comically high stack of boxes (like 7 12.5x 12.5 x 8"") to the post office, and an older grandfather-like man saw me struggling (and with more on the ground) and the grabbed a few off me and the ones on the ground and helped me into the post office. He also asked if I could help him with the stamp machine so I guess it was an equal trade really."
899,"An anonymous Christmas card was delivered to me one night while I was working as a waitress. A co-worker brought it over to me while I was bussing tables and said that a young man had handed him this card and asked him to give me the card and then he abruptly left.

  I had a family and barely scraping by and Christmas for the kids was going to be tough that year. I opened the card and inside was this very beautiful card with the most loveliest, amazing holiday sentiments and $280.00 in cash. 

The card was unsigned so I never knew who sent it. I suspected it may have been one of a few regular customers I served who knew enough about me.

Our Christmas was spectacular that year and not knowimg who our magical benefactor was makes it all the more special.13 years later that act of generosity still brings a smile to my face every Christmas."
900,A guy thanked  me when I held the door for him
901,"I went for a christian camp that lasted a week. As i reached the front of the line to be served dinner, the server complimented me and said that i looked really beautiful. It made my day because i wasn't feeling good let alone beautiful. It still nakes me smile to this day"
902,"when i started working at my previous barber shop, i was struggling financially. i barely had any clothes to wear and had like three pairs of shoes. i wore one pair to work one day not realizing that the bottom of one shoe was falling apart. i figured if i walked carefully i could get away with it. and i did. until i was leaving the shop and walked past my bosses in their car. she rolls down the window and i already know what she‚Äôs about to say. i tell her i didn‚Äôt notice how bad they were til i got here but didn‚Äôt want to go home and miss out on clients but wouldn‚Äôt wear them again. she said okay and i walked to my car. 

as i‚Äôm getting ready to drive off her husband knocks on my window and hands me $80. he told me that they know how hard i work and i deserve a new pair of shoes. i could‚Äôve cried, it meant so much. i worked there for TWO WEEKS at that point. 

i worked for them for two years and it broke my heart to quit. i recently got to hang out with the former lady boss. i hadn‚Äôt gotten to talk to her much since quitting ‚Äî i always thought she hated me for quitting. she doesn‚Äôt, she understood it was to further my career and had nothing to do with them and just needed time to process. but she told me something that will stick with me just as much as them buying me new shoes. 

i‚Äôm a little drunk so i‚Äôm trying really hard to remember what exactly she said, but it was something like she‚Äôs seen her husband her very attached to two kids. one being his step daughter and the other being me. i never knew he felt that way and to hear her cry as she told me that made me feel SO BAD for quitting even though they are as money motivated as me and understood it was purely a financial decision and not a personal one. i got a little off topic and ramble-y here, but i just never thought i would ever in my life have employers who felt that way. and as someone who‚Äôs parents have lived out of state for almost ten years, i always saw them as almost second parental figures even though they signed my paychecks. i just have so much love for them and feel so lucky that beginning to end to after the end, differences while an employee aside, we‚Äôve all been able to keep in touch and stay supportive. 

tl;dr former employers gave me hella cash money to buy new shoes instead of telling me to get it together for wearing ratchet ass torn up boots to their nice shop."
903,"I had a panic attack at the mall once when I was walking around alone. I sat on a bench and staring off into space I knew I needed to focus on something. I saw someone walking towards me and I was going to ask them to find me water. It turned out it was one of my best friends, they freaked out and ran to get me water. I said I couldnt move cause my legs went numb. He asked if I was going to be ok while he went to get help. I said yeah. He came back a few min later with his disabled gf, also one of my besties, and she has one of those walkers with a seat on it. They got me on the seat and she wheeled me to her car that was closer than mine, loaded me into it and drove me back to my car. She sat with me till my husband got off work and even wheeled me back into the mall for a bathroom trip while we waited. She could barely walk but she knew I needed help and mustered all her strength to take care of me when I couldnt. When my hubby finally arrived, (he also worked at the mall) he got in the car and drove me straight home where he helped me to bed and kept taking care of me till I could get back to normal."
904,"In college my statistics class was at 8am once a week. Now that I'm a working professional, 8am is a perfectly reasonable time, however at the time, 8 am was unbelievably early compared to other classes. I drug my ass out of bed and begrudgingly crawled to class. I was feeling particularly low as I had boyfriend trouble on my mind. When I arrived to my seat another student who I had only ever interacted with once had bought me a coffee. It was so unexpected and without ulterior motive that I started to cry on the spot. The poor guy did not understand what was happening."
905,"I was on my lunch break during a particularly rough shift in retail. I was texting my best friend about it. A few hours later when I finally got off, I went out to my car and hanging on my car mirror was a bag with a bouquet of flowers and some avocados. It made me cry, I‚Äôm so grateful to have such a good friend"
906,"I work as a haematology RN and although I have pretty solid emotional barriers, very occasionally a patient slips through the cracks and I become emotionally invested in them.

One such patient was a 24 year old man who I nursed for almost 2 years from diagnosis to death. The day he died I was with his family in ICU as they turned off life support. I kept it together at work, but walking out of the hospital I was absolutely broken and could not stop crying on my walk home. I will never forget the stranger who stopped on the side walk, gave me a hug  and said ""today will be over soon, and tomorrow will be better.""

The fact that someone went out of their comfort zone to comfort a random crying stranger honestly meant the world to me. I wish I could go back and thank them now."
907,How are you doing now? I hope your doing good.
908,Thank you for sharing this and I am so happy your life is so much better now
909,"I'm great, thank you so much for asking! I am very blessed these days. Housed, in college, employed (even now! extra blessed!) and I have a two year old daughter. Life is good. :)"

912,"It will only cause me continuous grief if I make it an issue. Besides, I'm more than my looks."
913,It doesn't bother me. I like the way I look. I have no desire to be society's idea of what's considered conventionally attractive.
914,"IMO beauty and ugliness are somewhat subjective to begin with, but most of all I wish society as a whole would start focusing more on the fact that people - and women in particular - have *a lot* more to offer than their beauty, instead of trying to shove the idea that everyone is beautiful, like someone admitting they don't find everyone or themselves beautiful is unacceptable.  
  
Not everyone is conventionally attractive/beautiful and that should be fine as well. There's so much more to give - charisma, personality, compassion, dedication, etc."
915,"As someone who has travelled a lot, ""ugly"" is a highly subjective term."
916,"Same way you accept anything else about yourself. If you feel like you can‚Äôt change it then treat it like anything else you can‚Äôt change. Height, race, etc."
917,"Lotsa people have called me ugly (like incredibly ugly and manly and Very Obviously Jewish and other gross shit ) but others have found me beautiful and I find myself beautiful so I ain't accepting shit. Hell, I've come to terms with if I want to lose weight and *why* - not for fucking incels online that's for damn sure. But maybe because of how I want to look.

Now there are things that are hard to accept I bet - if you have disfiguring scars for example. But even then you still have beauty even if you stray from standards.

Standards are bullshit. Love yourself."
918,"I'm not an ugly woman and am actually content with my looks, however I am aware that I am not conventionally ""beautiful."" I also have rather unconventional hobbies and interests so I am more than aware that most do not find me interesting either. I try to focus on features that I love (my skin and eyes.) But more importantly, I try to focus on what my body can do vs what it looks like."
919,‚ÄúPretty is not the price you pay to exist in the world‚Äù
920,I accept the fact that I‚Äôm not beautiful in the same fashion that I‚Äôm ill. I‚Äôm not happy with it but there isn‚Äôt anything I can do to change it.
921,"I dont know if I am ugly, but I am unattractive. Small round face, big nose, small lips. I just accepted that this is my face, its mine and only represents my outward appearance, it doesnt show anything else like my hobbies or sense of style."

923,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What someone finds beautiful may not be beautiful to someone else and vice versa. Focus on your self love, acceptance, and personality.  Being a wonderful person to be around makes you beautiful to others."
924,You either learn to live with it or spend all your money on plastic surgery.
925,"For features I don‚Äôt like on myself, I focus on either the family members I inherited them from or famous people with similar features and every time I start to think something like ‚Äúeugh, my nose‚Äù, I redirect it into ‚Äúhow nice is it that I have the same nose as my mother and grandmother!‚Äù etc. It takes a while to really be effective but has really helped me accept everything about my looks."

933,You're not ugly. You're just not your own type. But you're someone's type.... and to that person you're beautiful
934,I'm fine with it .... now. It used to get me down in my 20s but now I'm like fuck it. I'm a nice person and that's the important thing.
935,No such thing as an ugly woman üíõ you're beautiful and special in your own way
936,"Watch RawBeatyKristis ""How I stopped being self consious"" video. She talks about how she basically stopped obsessing/caring what other people think about her appearance, listening to her was eye opening."

Also, I‚Äôd work on changing your mentality. Sure, you may not be the most attractive person out there, but very few people are. There‚Äôs things that you can do to work on your appearance. Exercise, Flattering Make up routines, skin care routines and developing your character."

Kinda judgey OP."
943,"By not calling yourself ugly, for starters. Ugly is subjective, and the kind of word that can only make you feel bad about yourself.


Try instead accepting your body by objectively describing it. For example, instead of saying ""I'm ugly, and that's ok"", a better way to reframe it would be ""I have excess belly fat (or wrinkles or big nose, or whatever it is for you...), and that's ok.""  You could also try saying to yourself ""I have _____ ;  it's mine, and I love it.


I have a magic mirror that whenever I look in it, it feels like I'm looking at myself through the eyes of someone who loves me deeply. When I look in this particular mirror, I have the same fat and other flaws as I normally see in other mirrors, but somehow it doesn't feel ugly to me anymore. The fat feels beautiful because it's me, and I love me.


 You could try thinking of your body that way. I'm still working on it myself."

I don't want to invalidate your experience and I'm sorry that you're struggling but I hope that you are able to overcome the obstacles you face in seeing your beauty.

992,"That's not my point. You're twisting my words. I'm saying that looks aren't important at all, who's attractive or looks good is subjective and irrelevant. We shouldn't value ourselves by something we mostly cannot control. There are much more valuable qualities to a person than looks."
993,I just said that's irrelevant.
994,[removed]
995,"I think thats the test of a long lasting relationship, if you can weather the cycles that happen throughout the course of the relationship. 

Clarissa Pinkola Est√©s has a great quote from her book ""Women Who Run with the Wolves"" that I think a lot about when I'm experiencing a low point in my relationship..it's all about embracing it as part of the life cycle, and growing from it or being honest with yourself whether its worth it to continue or not. 

""Sometimes the one who is running from the Life/Death/Life nature insists on thinking of love as a boon only. Yet love in its fullest form is a series of deaths and rebirths. We let go of one phase, one aspect of love, and enter another. Passion dies and is brought back. Pain is chased away and surfaces another time. To love means to embrace and at the same time to withstand many endings, and many many beginnings- all in the same relationship"""
996,"I've been married for 15 years and while we've grown and changed a lot throughout it our level of passion in the relationship hasn't really gone down.  We are deeply committed and comfortable and happy but that didn't lead to a decrease of passion or intensity. I think we are actually more likely to cuddle, hug, etc and we have more sex than we did when we got married. 

I think it depends on the relationship though. If you're happy with what you have then there is no reason to change it and a decrease in intensity doesn't necessarily mean a decrease in love. And it's common for that to go up and down depending on what is happening in your life."
997,"I like metaphors, so I think I‚Äôll illustrate this with a campfire.

When you first start a campfire, it‚Äôs the easy things lighting up. It‚Äôs bright, it‚Äôs showy, and it‚Äôs a little unpredictable.

If the fire doesn‚Äôt go right out, you can catch the logs in the flames. The campfire stops being as flashy and becomes comfortable to be around, but still at least as hot and more durable.

The success of your campfire depends on a few things:
- the quality of your materials (call it chemistry)
- the foundation you build (you can get lucky just throwing logs in a pile, but a solid foundation helps; getting to know each other)
- your willingness to keep putting logs on (working together to keep the relationship alive)

In my relationships, the ones that survived the kindling phase I found myself just as excited to see my partner, but also comfortable around them. In the ones that ended either we burned out due to lack of effort or poor chemistry or I got ‚Äúsmoked out‚Äù due to something wrong with the relationship.

In my current relationship, we‚Äôre both equally committed. We have the fiery passion still between us but being around each other feels like home. And we both put logs on the fire."
998,"I think love in the long term is a choice. I am only speaking in terms of long term relationships, and when you meet someone you connect to immediately.

At first, there is the infatuation stage, where you want to be around each other constantly. Then, there is the fun ""lovey dovey"" stage where you want to be with each other, but not necessarily all the time. For myself these stages tend to blend, like the first will last 2 months, and the second about 5 months. After that, you have to make the effort. You get complacent in the normalcy of the relationship, date night on Friday, get tacos on Tuesday. Now I am not saying you fall in love at this point. I've noticed it tends to fizzle at the end of the first or second stage, no matter the time period you put to it (days, weeks, months, years). But typically after the second is when you have to work it. Make plans to do something that still shows excitement and love, like a terrifying rollercoaster or even watching a terrifying movie, something to provide intense emotion.

Intense emotion is an amazing way to keep a relationship going. So, last time I saw my partner, he showed me a video of a husky blowing bubbles in a puddle. I started laugh crying, practically kicking him in bed as I found it hilarious and adorable, and for some odd reason that damn husky made me laugh cry for like ten minutes. After that, my boyfriend looked at me and said he never loved me more than now, even while red faced and puffy. All because of a damn husky blowing bubbles that made me freak out, but it was an intense emotional experience he experienced with me, and he loved seeing the pure joy I had."
999,"Been married for more than 20 years. It's comfortable mature love as the years goes by. It's pleasant, stable and loyal. Not every day is fantastically good but still good."
1000,That quote is beautiful! Thank you for sharing it
1001,"When the relationship does not add positivity to your life, but instead takes it away. When you find yourself making excuses for their words or actions towards you that you don‚Äôt know you deserve. When you find their presence draining and feel happier when they‚Äôre not around than you do when they are."
1002,"For me a toxic relationship is something that brings more stress & pain than it brings positive things. When the bad outweighs the good, the majority of the time, that's toxic. 

Anything that results in you having to change yourself fundamentally, to avoid conflict. Examples;

Regular conflict.
Manipulation 
Pettiness
Jealousy.
Controlling.
Verbally abusive.
Disrespectful."
1003,"Lack of freedom, controlling jealous behaviour, any kind of abuse or insults, guilt tripping, excess arguments, having to lie due to fear or to not anger them, different values"
1004,"When I think specifically of a toxic relationship I think of one where the negative aspects of it creep into other areas of someone‚Äôs life. For example telling friends you can‚Äôt go out and making up an excuse because your partner doesn‚Äôt want you to leave them even for a few hours, or when you feel like you are being tracked because of someone who has violated personal boundaries and has no problem doing it. Some relationships just suck and that‚Äôs basically it, but to me the toxic ones are the ones that affect things on the outside of that relationship."
1005,"He brought out the worst in me. Never in my life have I ever felt such anger, sadness, and loneliness than when I was around him. It wasn‚Äôt until I let him go that I became a happier and lighter person."
1006,"Fighting often, cheating."
1007,"Someone who wants you to consider their happiness before your own.. Someone that gets upset when you say ‚Äúno‚Äù to them, or gets mad when you need space from them. When you find they add nothing positive to the friendship/relationship, they‚Äôre toxic."
1008,"For selfish personal gains and isn't sincere. Of course I don't mean business relationships. Eg people who befriend or date a person for money/popularity.

And people who always want to win, even to the extent of hurting the other party.

And the jealous/possessive type."
1009,When one person thinks they have power over the other person or some sort of control.
1010,"When you shouldn‚Äôt be together, but stay together and resent each other. When there‚Äôs constant cheating/betrayal. When there‚Äôs abuse, emotional or physical. When being with them simply brings out the worst in you. When you don‚Äôt share the same ideas about what it means to be in a relationship. When one is only interested in using the other."
1011,Exactly what I was gonna say
1012,"I'm sorry, a beard?"
1013,before we entered the relationship
1014,"A beard is when a gay person dates the opposite gender so as to stay in the closet, basically."
1015,"I have not heard this term in a long time, but I think it means a gay guy having a relationship with a woman to cover up that he is gay.

I have always thought it was really weird and bi erasure."
1016,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beard_(companion)
1017,"Ohhh, I see. I hadn't heard that before. Thanks!"
1018,How would that be bi erasure? It‚Äôs not a term for bi people dating someone of the opposite gender.
1019,"I hadn't heard that before, thanks!"
1020,"The idea that a bi person is dating the opposite gender means that person is ""covering up"" that they are gay.  Might it be they are simply interested in both genders?"
1021,"But this isn‚Äôt a term applied to a bisexual person. (Though I‚Äôm sure someone may throw it out as in insult in that scenario.) While sometimes there‚Äôs an unknowing partner the term  refers to a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù that exists to keep up social pretenses really. Think more in lines a gay man in a conservative country who marries a girl. She gets the protection and status of marriage and he doesn‚Äôt have to explain to family/ colleagues why he hasn‚Äôt settled down yet. 

The term shouldn‚Äôt refer to someone who just happens to be in a cis relationship while but bi."
1022,"I understand what it is.  I explained it already.

None of that invalidates it being used as bi erasure?  And I am not sure why you wanted to explain something I already explained once?"
1023,"Short answer: I ate less and moved more, and I maintain it by staying fairly active and eating the calories I need for my level of activity.

It's primarily about eating habits.  I didn't go on a specific diet - I just cut out the junk (especially added sugar) and ate fewer calories.  To maintain long term, I needed to change my relationship with food.  That's what made the difference for me.  I had to stop eating for entertainment and out of boredom and learn to view food primarily as a source of fuel.

If you feel like you're making healthy food choices and still not losing weight, I highly recommend tracking all of your calories (precisely!), at least for a little while.  Don't estimate portions - you could easily end up being off by a few hundred calories or more by the end of each day.  Using a food scale makes accurate measuring so much easier.  And if you're exercising, be careful to not overestimate how many calories you're using.  It's probably less than you think, and you can easily erase your caloric deficit by allowing yourself to eat more because you feel like you worked hard."
1024,Intermittent fasting. Maintained by much smaller portion sizes than before during non-fasting periods.
1025,"Calorie counting and a high-fiber diet.  I tend to binge eat, so when that urge hits me I fill up on low-caloric-density foods like steamed vegetables or rice cakes.  Prescription appetite suppressants worked well for me, but only for a few months at a time.  Now that I'm just maintaining my weight, I don't count calories anymore, but I've stuck to eating tons of vegetables."
1026,"Watched quantity and quality of the food I ate... including keeping a food log for accountability. Then moved more like first post. Remember each day is a new day. Don't get down on yourself if you make a bad choice, or one you regret. You can keep it off!"
1027,"Ok, so I lost 40 pounds. But I‚Äôm 5 feet tall, so I‚Äôll chip in.

Weight loss is literally calories in, calories out. Your body burns a certain amount of calories a day to maintain its weight. Eat 500 less than that each day x 7 days = -3,500 deficit = 1 pound loss. You can eat whatever you want, just don‚Äôt go past that amount. Although personally I would recommend low calorie, filling foods. You can find the amount it takes to maintain your weight on a TDEE calculator online. Set it to sedentary since most people overestimate how many calories they burn and you want any exercise you dip to increase your deficit. Get a calorie tracker app on your phone. For strict accuracy, you can weigh your food for calorie counting. Weigh once a week. If you‚Äôre not losing weight, decrease your calories."
1028,So I *did* maintain a 115 lb weight loss for over a year. I‚Äôm not maintaining it NOW because I found it miserable to eat so few calories and I hate exercise.
1029,"Although I don't know the exact amount of weight I've lost, I'll give you my two cents. I started seeing a dietician who helped me distinguish between myths and methods when it comes to sustainable weight loss. The key is to aim for a healthier lifestyle, not for a numbered amount of kilograms lost. I do vaguely aim for a certain size, but I'm not too hard on myself. Calorie counting, fasting and eating like a pigeon isn't healthy or sustainable; I had to change my habits. 

There's a lot of confusion when it comes to which products are good for you, although ""healthy"" isn't a dichotomy, but a complex smorgasbord of products complementing one another. Sometimes it's healthy to eat chocolate, because you've been craving it and your diet's been going steady. The key word here is *sometimes*. I use the terms A, B and C choices: A being unmistakably healthy in the right portions (fruit, vegetables, whole grain products, low-fat dairy, lean proteins), B being healthier alternatives (whole wheat biscuits, dried fruits, peanut butter, low-sugar jam) and C being everything else that's rich in fat, sugar, salt and deliciousness. My goal is for my main diet to consist of A choices, to snack on B choices and to now and then go overboard with a tasty C choice product."
1030,"Would recomend looking into HAES and Intuitive eating. I struggled with and ED for 9y and got tired of everything related to weightloss. Intuitive eating has helpt me have a different outlook on food and eating. 

Dieting and losing weight is exahusting"
1031,"That depends on the person. Some would take a month, some others a year. There's no right answer, just do what you feel is right."
1032,I would date whenever I felt ready to do so. There's no specific time limit.
1033,As long as it took me to feel ready - could be 1 week 1 month or 1 year
1034,"How do you feel about the situation?

Are you completely ready to move forward with out looking back?"
1035,"There isn't a specific time limit, just start dating when it feels right to you. Don't worry about what other people think or say, it's a very personal decision."
1036,Whenever it feels right!
1037,"It would depend on the duration of the relationship and the issues that led to the end of the relationship. Regardless, before dating, I would take a personal inventory of the reasons for the relationship failure and do some work on myself before I got back into dating. This would help ensure that I wasn't bringing unhealthy emotional baggage into the next relationship and assist me in making the best future relationship choices possible. It's really a personal decision, however, there is a much higher chance (in my opinion) to make bad choices when we are in emotional pain. If we don't work through the pain and the reasons the relationship ended, we are at risk of repeating unhealthy patterns and sometimes choosing people that aren't healthy for us (or hurting people by getting involved too soon when we aren't healed)."
1038,Could be as little as the next day or as long as years
1039,As long as I needed.
1040,Until it felt right to date again.
1041,I would wait until I felt ready.
1042,"It depends on how emotionally attached I still am to that ex including resentment,  regret, anger ect. I just think it's important you're emotionally stable before entering into another relationship. I can't give a set time, it just depends on how you adjust and reorient yourself to a new normal."
1043,"It took me about 2-3 years until I decided I was ready. But like everyone says, make sure you‚Äôre ready.

Take some time to just focus on you."
1044,It depends. I thought I would marry mine. My ex and I broke up 4 months ago and we were together 4 and a half years. He's moved on with someone else already. I've been with other people since but I can't emotionally invest in someone right now. Huge difference between getting with people and seeing someone. I could see someone emotionally if I wanted but I know it won't end well and the other person will get hurt. Doesn't need to be a time frame- just listen to how you feel
1045,If I would've put a time limit in it then I wouldn't have met my husband.
1046,"I'd wait until I felt other them, and the relationship, and knew I was ready to move on. 

That could be immediately, that could be a few months, it could be a few years. Sometimes you detach and are over it before the breakup even happens, sometimes it takes a long time."
1047,Probably a month or two
1048,"I've been here. I jumped on Tinder for hookups maybe a month later but really wasn't interested in pursuing a romantic relationship. I sort of fell into one 4 months after that simply because it was so natural and it felt right, not necessarily because I was seeking out that kind of relationship."
1049,"However long it takes for me to feel okay dating again. Maybe a few weeks or maybe a year, you just have to go by when you feel ready."
1050,By distancing from them and no longer being friends. I dont need that drain on my life.
1051,I left that friend group when they were so focused on themselves and their interests instead of building a lasting relationship.
1052,"I‚Äôve pulled away, kept myself as an acquaintance rather than a friend or close friend. They won‚Äôt be there for you when shit hits the fan in your life. I don‚Äôt put in effort that I know won‚Äôt be reciprocated. I can handle being around them for a little while, but there is no true friendship with someone who won‚Äôt acknowledge the world doesn‚Äôt revolve around them and that friends support and listen to one another equally."
1053,I got tired and distanced myself from them.
1054,These friends aren‚Äôt worth it. I recently stopped trying with one last summer and I can honestly say I am way better off and much happier.
1055,These type of friends drain your energy too much. Best way is to distance yourself and maintain as less contact as possible.
1056,"I had a friend like that and eventually I got so sick of everything being about *her* constantly that I distanced myself as far as possible and just stopped talking to her. At the time I felt horrible in doing so, but now I realize it was the best decision for myself."
1057,I walk away.
1058,"All people are flawed.. myself included. I realize this and handle it on a case by case basis. I have a few friends that are, while quite self absorbed, still good people. Others are just A-holes. The question is, ""how much does it bother me?"" and ""Is it worth it""...."
1059,"I am self absorbed privately not vocally or publicly so enjoy hearing other girls talk about themselves 

Irl I am instantly bored answering questions about myself but can listen to other people for hours"
1060,Not self absorbed friends but my youngest sister 17f is so self absorbed borderline narcissistic. I just ignore her and don't communicate unless I have to. Life is too short to fill it with other people's negativity.
1061,I usually distance myself for a bit...and the friendship usually ends soon after.
1062,Called them out on their shit
1063,People commenting here: What do you consider a self-absorbed friend?
1064,Cut em loose
1065,"I've never had self absorbed friends, you choose the people you hang around with."
1066,"Oh my goodness, I‚Äôm so glad you said this, because I totally agree and this is SO what I do. I‚Äôve had so many horrible friends do that to me and just bluntly told them that I wouldn‚Äôt be taking their crap, and I instantly felt better. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre able to do this as well! It‚Äôs such a relief and I don‚Äôt regret it, I just wish others could do the same."
1067,This\^ Unfortunately it's who they are. I ended a 7 year friendship by being distant then I just told her I couldn't do it anymore and that I was sorry. We were on and off as friends for the last 2 years and it just got tiring. I do hope she is doing well.
1068,"I wouldn't go.  History is terrible to women and I require modern medicine to live.  

Fuck the past.  Now if I could go forward, different story"
1069,"Yeah nah. being a black dude, this is not the move for me."
1070,"Could I jump to the end of Covid 19, but before Covid 21?"
1071,"Would anyone really choose to live in the past? There has been so much progress within society and technology wise. I‚Äôd love to visit, but never to stay. If I had to however I would love to see the world pre industrial revolution before many habitats got destroyed and species of animals became extinct."
1072,Pre colonial north America when native people had cohesive societies and robust traditional lives that honored the earth.
1073,"I wouldn't. Being a black woman isn't really the safest thing in previous times...I wouldn't even want to go back to when my mother was my age. Things aren't perfect now, but have been and could be a lot worse."
1074,"If I had to do so, I would choose a time before humans existed, but in a climate, location, and time where there was plentiful food, easy shelter options, and few predators that would be a risk to a human."
1075,"I wouldn't. The past isn't exactly known for treating women well, so, while there are tons of eras I would love to briefly visit, there are none I would want to stay in. I would say I'd rather go to the future, but I'm not all that optimistic about what that looks like now."
1076,"The 70s. I can vote, choose my own skirt length and go to college without going bankrupt. I'll graduate with some spare change and travel through Asia. Be scared of the Russians for a bit but move on. Hang out in Germany, put a hammer through the wall. I'll see the rise of computers, the internet and smartphones, but I get to enjoy [Amsterdam](https://youtu.be/Kr8jZ6sWF9I) before they're common. I make a false terrorist threat to the WTC on September 10th 2001. I buy bitcoin in 2010 and sell them in 2018 and finally, I spend 2019 collecting fucking toilet paper."
1077,Being a South Asian I would say a time before the British invaded as my homeland was nothing like we see today
1078,I'm staying here where my husband and my daughters are. And also a time period where I'm allowed to have a job.
1079,Would maybe go back to the beginning of high school so I could be more smart about some decisions back then.
1080,I would go back one year so I could plan to win the lottery.
1081,"I‚Äôd travel back in time like 2 months, prepare for the pandemic better, and try to warn everyone I could. Other than that, I‚Äôm pretty happy with my current life and I wouldn‚Äôt want to leave it."
1082,"The mid 1990s. Yes I'm serious.

Not too bad in terms of medical care and social acceptance. Things would be harder for me as a lesbian than they are now, but not too dangerous. I speak the language and understand the tech of the time period. 

The most important thing is that I could bring a portable hard drive or a bunch of CDs loaded up with  all the most important scientific papers from the last twenty years and give it to people in the 90's. They'd have the capability to both read the information from the drive/disks and be able to understand it thus jump starting science by two decades. This would give us time to head off some of the effects of global warming and prevent deaths from disease.

Also I'd actually understand local politics and my knowledge of future events would be relevant. I could explain some of what was coming with great specificity and possibly I'd be able to persuade people to do things a bit differently."
1083,"As a Black women I see these posts and I'm like ""What kind of privileged tone deaf nonesense is this....to be sitting around fantasizing about going back to the past. Must be nice"" lol"
1084,"nowhere. I'm a latinx lesbian immigrant. The past would not be kind to me.

Even the present isn't good enough sometimes.

And I would've died at 3 without modern (like, post-1970s) medicine. So."
1085,"2013, maybe I could re-do a few things I screwed up."
1086,I'd just go back to like 5 minutes ago. I don't want to live in the past.
1087,There's not too many eras I'd want to visit as a woman.
1088,"Oh hell no, stay away from me you Weeping Angel!"
1089,"I'd go back a couple of weeks, max, and only for something like lottery-winning purposes ...and to start Animal Crossing two days earlier so I'd be in sync with everyone else.  Why would I want to leave my husband and cats and nice house and all the comforts of home for a one-way ticket?

I wouldn't want to go back to ""historical times"" because 1) I'm a woman and history has pretty much always been awful for women. 2) I have an alternative appearance (piercings, tattoos, unnatural hair colour) that would make it exceptionally hard to blend in anywhere except maybe a circus or something.  At least I'm white so I could in theory take my piercings out and let my hair grow out so I could blend in eventually (as long as I go to a time where full sleeves and skirts hide my tattoos) but again, why the fuck would I want to do that to myself."
1090,"As bad as things may feel right now, this is legitimately the best time in human history to be alive. So I wouldn't, or if I did it wouldn't be more than a couple years."
1091,"Today, one second ago. The further you go there's less medicine and more desease and more religion and sorry but being a woman hundreds of years ago would be terrifying. Horrible idea üôÖüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1092,"Do I get to remember the future while I'm in the past? I'd only go back a couple of years, no more. There are a few investments I'd like to make..

Edit: spelling"
1093,1989
1094,"Honestly, I hate these questions. You'll never see a person of color, a woman, or anyone nonhetero ask this. I like being alive and semi unmolested thanks."
1095,"Love how accurate your username is!

I also agree with you and it's a total bummer. I would love to imagine a sneak peek in all kinds of societies. But in the end, when we take an honest look at the past, it all sucks for most of the people, especially women, the poor, and the sick. I'm not sure I would feel any better about travelling to some undisclosed future either though..."
1096,I am a person of color and happen to be a big fan of history. I understand the lack of modern medicine being a deterrent.
1097,Yes this.
1098,Heard. As a fellow person of color there is alot. Id like to have seen our ancestors do that was too amazing to be acknowledged by the europeans in that era.
1099,I honestly don't see any reason to go back in time. Just thought it would make for a good question. Lol.
1100,Nice placement.
1101,[removed]
1102,That's hilarious and i love it.
1103,Good call! Me too!
1104,"I was going to go for 15 years, invest wisely and maybe buy a slightly bigger home before the (current) bubble."
1105,You‚Äôd be surprised by how many women I see share things on Facebook about ‚Äúbeing born in the wrong generation‚Äù and wishing they were born in the 50s because they see some black and white picture of a couple drinking milkshakes in a diner and think the 50s were just full of romance.
1106,I‚Äôm with you. I‚Äôm a woman and I think about this question all the time. I love history and would love to be able to travel back in time to visit different periods. It‚Äôs not really gonna happen so it‚Äôs not that serious lol.

1130,"Go about my business.

I don't want people bothering me when I'm crying, and I won't do it to others."
1131,"I'd probably be too uncomfortable to say anything if I'm being honest, lol."
1132,"Be concerned for him and for me, but my safety is more important, so I would exit the elevator at the first opportunity to do so. If someone breaks down crying in an elevator, I don't have any idea of their current mental health space and am not interested in triggering a dangerous situation."
1133,Pretend I don't see or hear it.  Personally if I'm having a breakdown in public it isn't intentional and I rather people just pretend it never happened.
1134,Be alarmed because that‚Äôs how I react when anyone cries around me.
1135,"I would feel very stressed out. Not because he's a man, but because he's started to cry in a small space with me."
1136,"Ignore it. In NYC it is common for people to break down in public because so much life is lived in public, so pretending it's not happening is the most polite thing you can do."
1137,"I'd be torn between wanting to keep to myself and act like nothing's going on, and wanting to ask if they're ok and offer a tissue."
1138,"I'd be very confused and uncomfortable. I don't do well with such emotional displays, no matter who they come from (well, with exception of my husband and child)."
1139,"Look at my phone, ignore him, and exit on whatever floor it opens at next."
1140,"Just like I would if it was a small woman I would be uncomfortable then get out at my stop, maybe say ""sorry"" as I left. I don't even know what to do if my friends or family cry other then tell them it'll be ok. If I cried in an elevator I wouldn't want anyone to bother me or try to get in my business."
1141,Ask if they‚Äôre okay. And maybe give them a hug.
1142," I'd say ""hey..are you ok?"""
1143,"you don't talk to people in elevators here. you ignore each others' existence. that wouldn't change. if anything i'd just be more uncomfortable and on guard, because that is so deviating from the social norms that i can't say for sure that he is in his right mind. i would get away at the nearest opportunity."
1144,"Hit the button to get out at the next floor.  I am not going to be stuck in a soundproof box with someone who may or may not be mentally unstable or looking to get a woman close enough to grab.  My safety comes first and I could care less what a stranger thinks of me.  If he has a mother, wife, or sister then he should damned well understand that."
1145,"listen, offer help, a hug?"
1146,Ask if he's okay.
1147,Offer him a tissue and ask if he wants to talk about it
1148,"Ignore it and leave the elevator as soon as possible, as I would with any other adult crying in public. That's what I would want from someone else if the situation was reversed."
1149,"leave him alone, because no one likes strangers to intrude on their feelings"
1150,"Ignore it, then get out of said elevator as soon as possible."
1151,Statistically that person would also start telling me why they're crying. It's happened before. If I had my bag I would just silently give them a tissue.
1152,Give him a tissue and ask him what‚Äôs up.  He might be claustrophobic and just experienced his worst nightmare of being trapped in an elevator.
1153,Ask him if he's ok and does he need any help?
1154,Get off of his foot. No really I would probably ask if he was okay... it‚Äôs the empath in me. Plus if I was in his shoes I would want someone to ask me if I was alright.
1155,Pat them on the back and ask how they‚Äôre doing I guess
1156,I would ask him what's wrong and offer to at least listen.
1157,Start a conversation.
1158,Ignore it and continue on with my way.
1159,I wouldn't go to pat him on the back or anything but I'd ask him if hes ok or needs help.
1160,I‚Äôd be uncomfortable but I‚Äôd probably just say something like ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù
1161,"This is such an oddly specific scenario...  
I guess I'd ask him if he was okay? I wouldn't be pulling out the pepper spray just yet, but I do always carry a knife with me."
1162,Laugh and then comfort him
1163,"Honestly, idk what I‚Äôd do coz I never know what to do when someone‚Äôs crying, and also, my shy ass would probably be too wimpy to say anything to him."
1164,"Awkward, but I'd be concerned for him. I'd probably just ignore it, though. That happened to me once when a lady was crying in the grocery line. Everyone ignored it. I guess calling attention to it would have potentially caused more embarrassment."
1165,"I don't know what him being ""tough looking"" has to do with anything.  All people have emotions.  I'd be uncomfortable regardless and a bit concerned.  I'd get off the elevator as soon as possible."
1166,[removed]
1167,Agreed.  Sorry but my safety first and your feelings a FAR distant second.  That would be an excellent ploy for some serial killer to get a woman close enough to grab and incapacitate.
1168,Same. I would avoid eye contact and get out asap. Might have my pepper spray ready just in case
1169,"yeah i was gonna say. as a new yorker, i come across at least one person having a breakdown a day. i probably would barely notice tbh."

1176,Widespread racist eurocentric beauty standards
1177,White supremacy.
1178,"Racism and beauty standards. While I'm not a PoC, I have friends who have told me about their experiences colorism. I know my Indian ex-boyfriend was happy he was light skinned because that's considered more attractive. If you look at media, the majority of the women on shows are white. If they're not white, they tend to have lighter skin for whatever race they are."
1179,White supremacists' centuries-long stranglehold on beauty standards (at least in the US)
1180,"Racism, love."
1181,"Natural blonde hair and blue eyes are very rare, thus it‚Äôs coveted. When something is scarce, it‚Äôs perceived as more valuable and desirable. The majority of the world has brown hair and brown eyes."
1182,White privilege and racism
1183,"I agr√©e that it has to do with racism.  

However, even in white societies that were not historically diverse, blond hair and blue eyes signified beauty. 

Th√©ories are 

1) blonde hair signifies youthfulness, as many white folks are blond as children but then it turns in that brownish color as they age 

2)blond hair creates a halo type effect where it detracts emphasis on the face.  which is good as most people do not have perfect faces. 

it‚Äôs why a lot of actresses look amazing blond but not that great in other hair colors.  It‚Äôs also interesting to watch snl, where actresses will wear a bunch of different wigs and you can see the huge difference hair makes to attractiveness.

there is a theory that part of the reason black hair is so popular now, is because cosmetic procedures are much more accessible.  so you can make the tweaks to have that ‚Äòperfect face‚Äô.  And the black hair brings attention to the face."
1184,"Racism. There's nothing more bland than European beauty standards, if we're being honest."
1185,"It's ingrained on what should be desirable. Look at the media: even in cartoons and stories, think of Prince Charming. It matches that description and preconditions people from a young age. Look at current media on who is presented as desirable. All this influences who and what traits are desirable and what is beautiful."
1186,white supremacy
1187,"Racist standards that were set many years ago. Funny how even the most popular influencers and internet stars are, for the most part, still white and these studio chosen-esque people."
1188,"Just because everything has been whitewashed in media all throughout history,, experiencing this you eventually want to become white washed too. Especially for women, they go through unrealistic beauty standards."
1189,"Wealth and class, historically. And that women are supposed to attract men and men are supposed to win the women they are attracted to. I think men judge themselves on their appearance less.

In Europe, wealth and privilege meant staying inside, not engaging in labour, and wearing make-up. I suspect this is the same root for the Middle East.

In countries formerly occupied by European colonies, its the same as thing: white biases affording privilege to people most like them.

You also have it from black slavery: even once emancipated, black people had a lower social standing, so interracial children closer to white had better social success. Especially those that could pass as white.

But there might also just be an element of 'I wish I wasn't x'. Like ""I wish my hair was finer and less trouble to brush"" or ""I wish my body hair was fair and harder to see"" or ""I wish I didn't put weight on there"" and things like that. Things which actually aren't anything to do with being blonde or white, but with not being something else.

As for why we don't hear so many comments about people wishing they were black, or Asian, or such... I'm not sure why that is really."
1190,"Because it's rarer in England or it's rarer in the US as well. And the US sets beauty standards.

You have to get up into the Baltic states and Nordic countries to find majority blue eyed, blonde people. They weren't colonial powers. I imagine if they were that blue eyed and blonde would be seen as common and boring the same way brown eyed brunettes are in the US."
1191,Due to the majority of the people who control the media.
1192,"I‚Äôve heard women are more likely to be blonde than their male biological siblings. And hair tends to darken as people age so maybe it‚Äôs a signal of youth. And I‚Äôm guessing blonde hair is seen as more feminine if men are less likely to acquire that trait from their parents. I‚Äôve heard women (on average) also tend to have lighter skin than males of the same ethnicity. So, maybe lighter skin is seen as another signal of sexual dimorphism. 

Beauty standards in the west also tend to favor white/European standards so that plays a part in why lighter skin/hair/features are more ideal in society.
As for why men don‚Äôt say they wish they had blonde hair and blue eyes, I think it‚Äôs because that combination is seen as more conventionally feminine due to the stuff I said above. And tbh I don‚Äôt really hear men open up much about flaws that their body has to other people (e.g. being fat, being too skinny, short, hairy, etc). I think it‚Äôs a combination of: blonde/blue eyes not being seen as masculine AND not being interested in opening up about how they want to change their body"
1193,[removed]
1194,"I think another factor is the history of Hollywood, and media at large. It‚Äôs the reason why American culture has permeated the world."
1195,"In mediterranean countries, which is where I come from, being blonde with blue eyes, is rare (although my grandma is! Im not). Most people here are just tan, with brown, or maybe greenish eyes. Dark brown hair is the norm, black a bit less. 

So, people with lighter complexions stand out a whole lot more. 

I mean, also and very obviously racism. But, it's also true that in some parts of the world this has been a beauty standar for hundreds of years."
1196,"i don¬¥t think it is, a lot of other colored hair women praised in the media."
1197,"WASP-centric beauty standards.  People talk about 'eurocentric', but that's actually too broad - they're Anglo beauty standards.  People in Southern and Eastern Europe often don't look anything like the blonde, blue-eyed ideal, and are characterized as either 'exotic' or 'ugly', depending on who is doing the viewing."
1198,"I don't think it has been for a couple decades now, fashion media has long been about revolutionizing that standard. It lingers in everyday people because everyday people are less inclined to change their opinion regardless of what any form of media says about it. That's why the change of standards is much more obvious on a generational level than a general country-wide or global level."
1199,"Because of eurocentric media. I don't really think it has anything to do with racism. Media is made by white people for mostly white audiences. Asians still view pale women with jet black hair as the pinnacle of beauty, and you see that reflected in their media, but I don't think that's racist either."
1200,[removed]
1201,"I know that racism and unrealistic standards are the definitive reason for this, my question is why those features in particular."
1202,"Is being blond really that rare, it seems pretty common."

1208,"They're generally white traits. Blonde hair, light eyes and light skin are generally features only white people have. This isn't to say it's impossible for a PoC to have these traits, but it's much less common. 

The blonde thing may be related to being less common and stereotyped as attractive, too. It's more common to have brown hair, so that's why it could be something people want."

1213,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a stretch to say that now days a majority of white Americans aren‚Äôt  nazis.
1214,"I didn't claim they were. You want to know about these specific beauty standards. The Nazis are the epitome of a movement that worships those specific features due to racism. 

This is all a very well-researched topic. You could just do some google scholar searches about racist eurocentric beauty standards to find a lot of information on it."
1215,"No, but it's systemic racism. It's deeply engrained in our culture. We're shown white women are attractive because they're constantly in the media, so we internalize that is beautiful. We're socialized to believe certain things are attractive.

I know nearly every YA book I read as a teen described their main character as pale. I know growing up, there wasn't much variety in what characters looked like. The majority were thin, had straight hair, and were white.

You see it a lot in romance reality shows. The black, Asian and Latina women are ignored for the blonde women. You'll see these gorgeous women being passed over because they still aren't the norm. Like the other commenter said, if you look up systemic racism and beauty standards, a ton of studies and articles will come up."
1216,"No, that's a stretch."

1222,Once a week my partner and I do a Bob Ross painting party. We set up a table in front of the tv and watch and episode and paint. We have a hallway in the house with all of our paintings on it.
1223,"Cooking together, something fancy you both like, such as sushi or a risotto. Then watch a movie drinking your favorite beverage, that you'd order at your favorite restaurant."
1224,We always do dinner and a movie. Not my favorite (we don‚Äôt have money to play with to try new stuff rn) but it‚Äôs nice.
1225,"Board games are a fun thing we like to do, or play a video game together. Dinner and a movie or baking something together. A few weeks ago we baked a 3 layer cake  (neither one of us had baked one before), and that was fun learning to do something together. We also got this deck of couple conversation cards as a gift and it's kind of fun to go through a few of those. This weekend my husband grilled and I just sat outside with him and our dog and that was nice."
1226,Pamper night. I'm not usually into beauty stuff but I had some foot spa stuff someone had gifted me and decided to give it a go. My husband has a disability which causes him pain when he walks and make him put a lot of pressure on one foot. He had never had a foot soak before and it was nice to see him relax and say it helped him feel better (especially as we'd been out walking earlier in the day).
1227,We sometimes get drunk and have a dance off in our kitchen
1228,Baking some desserts from scratch!
1229,Trying out a new recipe to make together and then watching a film or tv series. Also if you have video games or board games that can be quite fun.
1230,A fancy meal with good wine. Maybe a multi-course dinner or a tapas-style feast. Followed by some boardgames and then a movie.
1231,Candles and massage oil :)
1232,Cooking for sure. Movie with cuddling. Or sitting in the balcony with a hot cup of coffee under the stary night rapped up in each other's arms and talking and kissing :)
1233,"Dinner, weed, Netflix and chill. Sometimes we play Scrabble."
1234,"Theme nights and dressing up are fun! We did an Italian themed date night, dressed up, made homemade pizza, Italian wine, aperol Spritz and watched Italian themed movie (Roman Holiday). Super fun and very versatile cause you could choose different countries Each week and try new recipes."
1235,Playing video games and watching anime.
1236,"Apart from all the foods and drinks, watching photos together, answering those 37 questions, listen to some music and cuddle, have a dance party, talk about plans for the future, just spend some meaningful quality time together without phones and other distraction."
1237,"cooking our own meal, watching silly videos, having a spa night"
1238,"Some of my favorite ideas are pizza and a movie (or football, or a TV show), cooking or baking together, playing video games (I particularly like Overcooked!), just sitting outside under a blanket and talking or putting on some music and doing a face mask together!"
1239,"Movie, cuddling, a few drinks, games, food."
1240,"We cook something, drink and play board games for our weekly date nights."
1241,"We're kind of homebodies, so we've got plenty of favorites, including but not limited to:

- Lots of movie watching

- Make dinner. Sometimes fancy if we're feeling it

- Board games. Our (or at least my) favorite is drunk Scrabble, mostly because it's way more fun to challenge words when you're both tipsy. I've played peal and woad before, and he was certain I misspelled peel and woahed. 

- Vinyl listening party, which you can just fake with Spotify and a speaker if need be"
1242,"We love cooking dinner together! We'll switch off with a recipe of our choice each week and it's super fun. I've been trying a lot of recipes from Bon Appetite. :) 

We'll also snuggle up on the couch and put on a movie afterwards."
1243,I would say our favorite is playing Mario together on the Wii! We have a couple games we rotate through but super Mario Wii is the best for two player.
1244,"We go to the store and buy a movie, one we‚Äôve never seen that looks good, get lots of snacks and stuff, then watch the movie and enjoy our snacks!! Super fun for us:)"
1245,"If you have shaving cream and food coloring on hand, you can make marbled paper with it. It's a super fun and strange process. It might be nice to make some cards to send people during quarantine time."
1246,Get one of those overpriced craft kits from Walmart or something. Like a candle-making kit or a bath bomb kit. Make cheesy overpriced candles.
1247,Dating Divas website has a ton of great date ideas for staying home
1248,That sounds amazing
1249,Try a foot soak with Epsom salts and some arnica gel afterwards  - totally unbeatable for pain relief!
1250,"Aw, that's really sweet. I'll have to find out what kind of pampering the spouse needs today..."
1251,I could see this happening in our house.
1252,Yummy! Do you have a favorite recipe?
1253,"Thanks for the tip. I already have some Epsom salts but haven't used them yet. Unfortunately, rubbing anything on his feet is a no-no because he's really ticklish and I may get kicked in the face for my trouble!"
1254,It can get pretty heated. And not just because we‚Äôre burning up the dance floor üòè
1255,"My ex and I would generally figure out what we had a taste for and then google from there. We loved making gingerbread cookies, snickerdoodles, sugar cookies, and one time we made black forest cake!"
1256,"Ooer, black forest cake sounds amazing!"
1257,"Technically, I would just say she is capable of feats of strength that would be beyond the average woman. 

Less technically, I wouldn't bother. No one needs a list of accomplishments to know whether or not some random person is physically strong outside of a strength competition or work need, and I don't see any value in guessing about it."
1258,"Well, only women are capable of pregnancy and childbirth, the most physically taxing thing the human body can endure. Every human being on this planet is here because of an incredible feat of female strength.

Edit: Also, since you deleted your comment, why do males always have to say ‚ÄúKIDNEY STONES ARE WORSE‚Äù whenever a woman talks about how difficult pregnancy and childbirth is? Men love downplaying female strength that they are incapable of replicating, yet will brag for hours about how their upper body strength is superior to that of women, as if that can‚Äôt be made obsolete due to advances in technology. Smells like womb envy to me. Male bodies are designed to have more upper body strength, yet for some reason only women‚Äôs natural strengths are downplayed in this way."
1259,Is it weird that I gauge strength by shoveling snow and tossing hay bales? So I guess someone who can do those things without help.
1260,Someone who has above average muscle mass because the only way to achieve that is through physical work or exercise.
1261,"It‚Äôs hard to define. I can bang out a decent number of press-ups and climb like a happy young chimpanzee, but I‚Äôm rubbish at carrying weight over distance and have never been great at weightlifting. I have friends who can‚Äôt do a single press-up, but will carry a heavy pack up and over mountains all day long. Some people would probably struggle to do that, but can deadlift terrifying weights in the gym for a single rep.

You can be physically strong in many different ways- athlete, gymnast, dancer, weightlifter, hearty country lass who can carry a pig under each arm, etc. It‚Äôs really hard to define a handful of exercises or a time or weight cut-off that encompasses all functional strength."
1262,I don't know. Physical strength isn't something I consider much. I see gymnasts as strong.
1263,"This is tricky. You can notice someone who is physically built and see that they are physically strong but there are also those who don't look overly muscular that are also physically strong. 

Like, I've seen women who I've thought ""Wow, look at those quads"" or ""Look at those shoulders"" but I've never looked at a woman who doesn't look as built and thought the opposite: ""Gee, she looks weak"". 

Look at some of the smaller UFC women's weigh classes. They're very strong but if you saw them out in jeans and a shirt, they wouldn't stand out. But are they physically strong? Heck yeah!"
1264,"I can do all of those things, and I am just me.  Is that supposed to be strong?"
1265,"I love to see a women with muscles. That's so bad ass to me.  I'm really into lifting and I know how much work goes into being able to hit personal records of deadlifting, lifting heavy, etc. It's empowering and takes a lot of mental strength to stick with it and push yourself through it.

I also agree with the comment that women are strong af because all the things we endure such as child birth or periods."
1266,Any woman that's a bodybuilder or an MMA Fighter is a very physically woman to me. They are amazing in my opinion.

1280,"I dated a picky eater once and I couldn't stand it, to the point where I had to end it because of it. It makes going out to eat and cooking, my favorite activities, a nightmare."
1281,"This was actually one of the big reasons behind a breakup for me. I am an adventurous eater and there‚Äôs almost nothing I won‚Äôt try. He was extremely picky about foods he disliked, how they were served, and how they were prepared. Omg I remember being at a resort in Cuba watching a cook make him an omelette and he told the guy exactly how he wanted it done. Ugh it bothers me when people can‚Äôt be easygoing with food (obviously I don‚Äôt mean allergies or vegetarianism). It was so hard to go eat with him anywhere and he worked full time at his family‚Äôs restaurant so we‚Äôd basically only ever eat there."
1282,"It hasn't at all. I'm vegetarian, my partner is not. I'd never ask them to change the way that they eat and they wouldn't ask me either. We share vegetarian meals often, but also they have meat in the fridge/freezer that they eat whenever they like, too. It's never been something that was an issue for us and unless you or your SO has an allergy etc. I don't feel like it should make a difference to how either person eats :)"
1283,"Major issues so we just eat seperate. We go to the grocery store and buy seperate food choices. He doesnt eat spicy, ethnic, apples, soy, caffiene, seeds, and added sugars/high salt. Youd be suprised what had apple juice in it... on top of this hes got germaphobia so meal prep is crazy for him."
1284,"It's made him a much more adventurous eater. I have the policy of ""you get what you get and you don't throw a fit"" when it comes to cooking, so if you don't like what's on offer, feel free to make your own food. He (and our kid) have developed quite the palate out of sheer laziness. 

Before anyone chimes in with ""he can cook too"", he certainly can, and does. But I like it and enjoy trying new recipes."
1285,Spouse has food intolerances that cut out 90% of the foods I love and cook for myself. We don't often eat the same meals therefore we can't bond over cooking a special meal and eating it together. Definitely not as dire as it may sound but I do miss that sort of thing now.
1286,"He‚Äôs more adventurous than I am, as I‚Äôm somewhat picky. I looooove sushi and sashimi, but that‚Äôs pretty standard by most people‚Äôs standards and isn‚Äôt all that adventurous. He can‚Äôt handle spicy food (which is interesting, as he is Southeast Asian), whereas I like hot-spicy food but dislike a lot of savory spices. I‚Äôm also very picky about meat and don‚Äôt eat pork or lamb, whereas he will eat anything, including fish-head soup and shark fins. We both love Mexican food, Italian-American stuff, and sushi, so we overlap enough that it‚Äôs never been an issue. We usually go out for sushi when we do get dinner together!"
1287,"It‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs hard especially because if I want to eat even remotely healthy, I have to do all the work. He refuses to prep vegetables or chop things up. We usually tag team dinner when we can but because I have a long commute home he usually does the cooking. I once spent 5 hours one Sunday planning and prepping meals for the week so all he had to do was throw it together when he got home. It worked out great but then I started to feel like it was slightly unfair for me to have to sacrifice hours of my weekend to make his life easier. 

But that‚Äôs because I handle so much of the other important shit that the meals really should be his job 100%. Anywho..........lol"
1288,My SO is a bit of a food snob. I don't care if we order pizza from Domino's or the Italian restaurant that was started by an Italian immigrant who survived the horrors of WW2 with recipes that have been passed down for generations. He cares more about that kind of stuff than I do so I let him pick the restaurants.
1289,"It's was a top 3 reason for the break up tbh. I went to culinary school and love to eat and cook and he was the pickiest eater I've ever met. He also had pica, soooo he wouldn't eat cheese, or condiments, or fruits/veggies or anything besides crunchy tan foods.... But it was all out buffet time on toenails, boogers, plastic bottle caps, and pencil erasers. 

My current bf will eat anything and everything. I can't even keep ingredients to make cookies in the house bc he'll eat that shit before I ever make any dough! Lol"
1290,"Not at all. I abstain from using ingredients he dislikes, and he does the same for me. I can add pepper to my plate, he can add olives to his, no fuss.

When it comes to more complex stuff, like whole dishes that one of us doesn't eat, we leave that to when we order in or go out to eat."
1291,"It's been a struggle sometimes! Lol

My SO and I both have autoimmune diseases that are very similar. 

Our foods that can ""trigger"" us are vastly different. To add to that, I have allergies too. (Gluten/dairy) so when we first got together, finding meals that we could cook together took a lot of fine tuning."
1292,I‚Äôm vegan and I dated a meat-lover for six years. Luckily he was very sweet and open-minded and always made an effort to find restaurants with menus that satisfied both of us and he often cooked vegan meals for both of us. I think I opened his mind a bit to soy and other meat alternatives. It didn‚Äôt negatively impact our relationship in the slightest.
1293,"When my husband and I first started dating we used to order each others food when we would go out. So I'd look at the menu, and pick what he would eat, and he'd choose mine. We always intentionally picked food that we thought the other person would like, because we aren't mean, but it kept us from getting the same food over and over.

He's more adventures than I am, so he's gotten me to try new things here and there, and marrying me certainly hasn't held him back from going anywhere. I can always find something to eat no matter what restaurant we are at. It probably helps that I'm not a big complainer and can chill with a salad and be happy."
1294,"I don't think our preferences are different enough to really affect the relationship. There's a few meals that I don't really enjoy which he does, and vice versa, so we'll just eat those when the other person isn't around. But that's a really small minority of food and I'd say 99.9% of the time we eat together."
1295,"It hasn't. I wouldn't date a super picky eater, though. I like going out and trying new foods too much."
1296,I‚Äôm extremely fussy when I get a choice.  Except I eat anything given to me and I usually enjoy it.  I just have ridiculous preferences.
1297,"To a certain extent. It hasn't caused issues or anything, but my husband LOVES red meat and I could cut it out of my diet for the most part as I prefer chicken. He also loves fast food and I do think I gained weight after we got married due to that. After a point I just had to realize that just because he wanted something specific that wasn't healthy it didn't mean I had to eat it. If he really wants something that's quick for me to make that I don't like I will eat separate or doctor it up different for me. Like he loves spaghetti with meat sauce, so when I make him that,  I just make myself a spaghetti salad with feta cheese, onion, olives, tomatoes, etc."
1298,I only get to eat seafood when we go out.
1299,"It‚Äôs really difficult. I‚Äôm a vegetarian who loves ethnic foods. He‚Äôs an extremely picky eater who doesn‚Äôt eat most vegetables and doesn‚Äôt like most ethnic foods. There is very little overlap in our diets, but we do want to try to cook at home and eat healthy when we can, so it‚Äôs a struggle. He doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable cooking most things, so completely separate meals doesn‚Äôt really work for us- he‚Äôll just end up eating chicken tenders or burgers every day. 

I have accepted that I will very rarely get to eat the foods I enjoy the most. He has made an effort to try some new things, and I try to sneak vegetables into foods when I can. He has learned to cook chicken breast, so usually I‚Äôll make some sort of basic ‚Äúbase‚Äù meal and he‚Äôll add chicken to his portion while I take the majority of the veggies. He picks around 90% of the veggies, sure, but that‚Äôs still more vegetables than he was eating before. In the end, I am less healthy than I was on my own, and he is more healthy, but we‚Äôre doing the best we can."
1300,"My ex husband only ate chicken nuggets, fries, mashed potatoes and a certain brand of hotdogs. We could only go to restaurants that served chicken nuggets. He made cooking for the children and I hard because I had to explain why Daddy is eating something totally different than us. We have been divorced for a while and I hear his habits have not changed."
1301,It didn‚Äôt affect at all. I‚Äôm vegetarian and he wasn‚Äôt and we worked great. I never made him change his eating and he never said anything about mine. It never complicated anything.
1302,"It hasn't affected our relationship a whole lot. We adapt and compromise. For instance, he violently hates onions, so when I make chicken tortilla soup I cook the onions separate in their own little pan and add them to my bowl later. When I cook meals you can't really make without the things he doesn't like, he'll just make something else on his own. It isn't too bad, despite his long list of hated foods, he's mature enough to figure out his own meals when needed and I'm fine without certain foods on occasion."
1303,I dated someone who was pescatarian but ate vegan most of the time.  I eat a lot of vegan and vegetarian food (maybe half the time) because I want to reduce my carbon footprint and it's just healthier.  It was hard to go out to eat because all the restaurants she took me to were trash.  I'm a pretty good cook and my food was better.  She also didn't like spicy food and I LOVE spicy food.
1304,Finally some foods I don't have to hide since he won't eat then before i can
1305,"It was a deal breaker for me, I don't have time for picky eaters."
1306,"Only for the better. My husband had a very bland palate and the only spice in his kitchen was salt, which was used way too much. I'm not an adventurous eater by any stretch, but I have just about every spice imaginable and can cook more than the 3 things he was living on when we met."
1307,"I dated a super picky eater and while it was really annoying to cook the same generic food and eat and the same generic restaurants, I didn't complain because we all have our quirks. When we were breaking it up, he threw the fact that we didn't go to sushi restaurants in my face because I don't like sushi. I literally LOL'd because he picked out one of the very few things I don't enjoy meanwhile he had a whole laundry list of things he wouldn't even TRY."
1308,"not even slightly. my husband and i eat totally different things. like, pretty much anything he likes, i hate, and vice-versa. but we also both work from home and so we're around each other ALL the time. this means we don't really do things that a lot of other people do to ""bond,"" like eat together. i.e., we never eat together. we just make our own food and eat by ourselves, and then we bond during the other like 23 hours we spend together, lol.

he generally doesn't like to eat at restaurants but he's fine with hanging out while i eat. so it's all good. 

honestly, it's not a problem at at all."
1309,"Mostly nothing unless he tries to force me to have things I don't like.

I respect the hell out of other people's preference. I wish everyone do the same."
1310,"I am cursed to be a picky eater. I try a lot of foods, but if I don't like something I just can't eat it. Much of it is a texture problem, like beans or eggs. I'm also allergic to peanuts which makes me wary of trying unfamiliar cuisine. I make sure not to make it anyone else's problem though; I can usually find something to eat anywhere. 

My SO will eat anything, even stuff she doesn't like. And she loves a wide variety of things. I don't have any rules about cooking certain things. Just need a heads up for things like seafood or bacon because the smells linger and make me sick. 

I think we deal with it fine. There is some tension around meal planning/choosing a place to go out to eat because she doesn't want to get shot down for suggesting something. We've been together 5 years so she definitely knows what is on the ""absolutely not"" list. That can get annoying simply because I'm the principal decision maker in general because she's so laid back so the food thing just adds to that feeling of responsibility."
1311,"I like MR meat, over easy eggs. Pretty much everything juicy and not cooked dry. My SO loves everything over cooked. Charred and crispy. Over HARD eggs, WELL DONE red meat. 

I just take my stuff off of the stove/grill before his and let it continue to cook. I don't mind really. I use the time his takes to finish to plate my food and get a head start on cleaning up the kitchen. 
Fortunately we both enjoy trying new things and both dislike onions and mushrooms."
1312,"I have celiac and was still getting sick, so our house is now gluten free. It... was not an easy thing to ask, and I'm sure it's hard to give up"
1313,"I grew up on an East Asian diet. I‚Äôve tried dating a couple meat-and-potatoes white boys, and it‚Äôs wreaked havoc on my digestive system. They would try to be nice and cook for me, or I would be graciously hosted by his parents, and I had trouble. I preferred to be the one cooking. 

It seemed like every dinner consisted of red meat and something cooked with butter.

Try as I might, I can‚Äôt eat buttered rice. It just tastes wrong.

Another time, I dated a SE Asian guy and hooo boy things were so spicy you couldn‚Äôt even taste them. My digestive system suffered again. I felt so left out because he and his family and friends would cook these mouth-watering things but I could barely get them down because of how spicy they were. Best food I‚Äôve ever had in a relationship though."
1314,"Thankfully we have quite similar tastes food wise, however he is diabetic and it's diet controlled so that has change thing somewhat. When I'm cooking dinner, I usually speak to him about what I'm planning to make though.

I cannot stand super spicy food so if we do make curry, we tend to do it very mild."
1315,"He's picky, so he cooks most of the time. I have cooked stuff 'even' my mother in law deemed almost (?) professional and he's been 'it's great but'. So, he cooks a lot."
1316,"It really hasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm vegetarian and my partner is not. Sometimes we both eat vegetarian food, sometimes only I do. But food really isn‚Äôt important to either of us, we kinda only eat out of necessity."
1317,I was adventurous and my ex only wanted basically a children‚Äôs menu. It hurt our relationship a lot because food is very important to me. I want to put things in my body that make it healthy and feed my soul and curiosity. My passion for flavors was constantly harassed by chicken McNuggets or some other greasy bland garbage. Note to future self if a man says his favorite meal is chicken Alfredo run for the hills
1318,I had one those - he called himself a ‚Äòfood snob‚Äô to compensate for the fact that he had the palette of a 6 year old. Done.
1319,"Same. Over the years I've learned that someone with a restrictive diet, whether because of pickiness or allergies, just isn't going to work for me long term. Cooking is one of my favourite hobbies, and having to really reign in what I cook would make me vastly unhappy. It is also important to me that we sit down together over a shared meal and connect at the end of our day, so I would not be happy with both of us cooking separate meals."
1320,"what kind of unhealthy meals does he cook on the regular? Often, home cooking is great because it tends to be inherently healthier."
1321,"this. When I'm home I like things to be very specific and will leave out a lot of ingredients. However, if I'm out, or if someone else prepared food for me then I can eat absolutely anything to be polite."
1322,I don't think I could handle that in a partner.
1323,"Same. I love cooking meals together, I love going to new restaurants together and trying new things, I love trying new recipes...since we've been working from home, my husband and I have been trying new recipes pretty much every day and it has been such a blast. It's helped make this a little less boring. I can't imagine trying to do that with a picky eater! Also my husband and I love doing this thing where we play ""Chopped"" when we get to the end of our food supply and it's just so fun.

Also our kids are not picky and will eat pretty much everything in front of them. They don't eat baby food. We give them our food, just cut up smaller so they can eat it easily. Makes it easier because we can just make one meal for the whole family and I hope our kids will want to share the experiences of trying and enjoying tons of different and new foods with us as they get older."
1324,Meatloaf with no sides. Pasta with no sides. Chicken nuggets. Hot dogs........
1325,I couldn't after a while. At first I saw it as a cute quirk but as the year passed it was just frustrating.
1326,"All of this! One of the key reasons I wanted a non-picky eater spouse is for our hypothetical kids. I don't want to have to explain why they need to eat their spinach / peas/ fish while dad eats a hot dog and tater tots. I want to model healthy, adventurous, well rounded eating. It's super important to me, as is eating dinner as a family. I have so many great memories of family dinners around the dinner table. 

>I love trying new recipes...

I've been doing some tidying and organizing since we're stuck at home. I have over 200 cookbooks and 4 different 3-inch binders filled with recipes I've cut out of magazines, newspapers and off the net. 

My mom has hundreds of cookbooks, even more self-assembled recipe binders. My aunt owned a catering company, so her cookbook and recipe collection is off the charts. I'll inherit all of them. At some point I will have an entire library's worth of cookbooks."
1327,"My fianc√© doesn't have my ideal body type, but he makes up for it by being by far the best man I have ever known. If I have to accept a flaw, I would rather it be a few extra pounds than something worse."
1328,"I'm a ""lift weights 6-12 hours a week and cardio every day or so"" type of gal and my husband is a ""I will occasionally use the pull-up bar and dumbbells we have at home"" type of guy. As long as he's not overweight to the point of detriment to his health and ability to do things, I'm good with it. I want him to be able to come with me on hikes or walks and not die early because of constant poor diet habits, for instance.

Edit: I want to add that physical attraction is very important too - I've seen a lot of comments in here casting doubt about the top replies. Not being a shlub is still big important.  Someone who takes some care of their body is important. I just don't have a rigid physical type past just a vague ""stocky brunette dude with big eyebrows and a distinguished nose"", which may come with a side of physical softness. I think since I was an overweight kid I shied away from lanky boys because I was self conscious about the comparison between us, and that preference has stuck. I appreciate muscular men but it isn't a requirement. Just a ""take care of yourself, avoid things that shorten your lifespan when you can, and don't get between me and my hobby"" kind of thing."
1329,"I am a personal trainer, so sport is a very important part of my life. I have dated chubby guys before, and the chubbiness was not a problem. However, giving me shit about my lifestyle, trying to make me live unhealthier, and being lazy was. Since then I know that having a similar lifestyle is a must in a relationship."
1330,"My friends call me a ‚Äúchubby chaser‚Äù - I spend hours working out and I‚Äôm pretty fit/ripped, but I like a chubby man. No idea why, it‚Äôs just my preference. I have had relationships with fit guys, too, but I prefer a bit of chub on a man."
1331,"I‚Äôm going to be totally honest:  I work really hard to stay healthy by eating well and exercising.  I think it‚Äôs important for so many reasons, and I married someone who thankfully shares that view.  I don‚Äôt expect my partner to be ripped, but I do want him to be healthy.  A few extra pounds is no big deal, but there would come a point where I would start to have conversations about us being an example for our kids and doing our best to stay healthy for them by eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly.  Now if he was doing both of those things and still gaining a lot of weight, I‚Äôd want to look into medical possibilities as to what‚Äôs up but I wouldn‚Äôt be turned off by it.  I think being active really is a lifestyle.  We run 5ks together, share lifting PRs, try new stuff together like rock climbing.  It sounds dumb, but it‚Äôs a shared interest/hobby that positively impacts our relationship.  Our marriage doesn‚Äôt depend on it, but I would miss it if suddenly we couldn‚Äôt do those things together anymore."
1332,"I weight lift, cycle, run, & do yoga. I‚Äôve definitely fallen in love with guys that were a bit chubbier & skinny guys that were a bit less muscular. My main issue with this is I‚Äôm a pretty active person. I love to hike, swim, snow board, climb things, and it‚Äôs always really great to have a partner that is fit enough to do all these things with you! Also the sex seems to be better due to stamina, strength, & flexibility."
1333,"I work out every day and its a big part of my life.  I would say im attracted to fit guys.  Ive never pushed a guy to lose weight or get buff or anything like that, but my current guy did that himself.  He started getting really into working out after dating me and now we share that together."
1334,"My BMI is in the normal range, I've got low body fat percentage and I train frequently. I'd say I'm in overall good shape. I like that my husband has a comfortable shape. I want him to be healthy first and foremost, of course, but even though I can admire the hard work that goes into maintaining one of those six-pack bodies in men, I'm not particularly attracted to them. Give me a loyal, witty guy with a dad bod over a self-obsessed gym bunny any time. (This is generalising quite a bit, but we're talking about tastes here, so I hope that's okay. I think for most people, once you love a person, you love them through thick and thin :))"
1335,"I‚Äôve found that as long as the person i‚Äôm dating  works out/is physically active, the body doesn‚Äôt really matter. It‚Äôs not the physical results, but the mindset of an active person that does it for me."
1336,"I'm typically not attracted to overweight bodies but if my fit partner gained some weight, I don't think it would change my attraction towards him because we have five years of love and chemistry behind us. If he stopped taking care of himself and really let himself go, I'd worry for his physical and mental health since it's a drastic change from how he is now. By mental health I mean that I'd worry about if he was depressed or something else was going on because he's always been very health conscious and active."
1337,"For me it depends on how chubby. If we're talking about having a dad bod so to speak it doesn't bother me. My husband has a small belly now and it doesn't bother me or effect my attraction to him at all. I think it's unrealistic to expect someone to stay as fit as they were in their 20's and 30's after you start having a family.

My ex-husband on the other hand gained over 80lbs over the course of 4 years (we were in our early 20s with no kids so there really was no excuse). Towards the end of our relationship I was extremely resentful of him and, I hate to admit it, I couldn't stand being touched by him. I hated that I worked to stay in shape and he let himself go on every level, from weight all the way to personal hygiene. 

Overall, I'm not attracted to the guys who are totally ripped (because it makes me feel that I need to be totally ripped, too) but I also don't like a whole lot of meat on a guy either. I personally prefer a normal looking guy who is conscious about his appearance and makes an effort to stay at least somewhat in shape, just like I do."
1338,"I dated a slightly chubbier man and I‚Äôll be completely honest, it bothered me a bit near the end of our relationship. He literally had no food in his fridge and ate out every single day. I enjoy cooking and eating healthy so when I travelled to his house, it was an odd situation that usually resulted in me compromising and picking something healthier for takeout. We would go hiking together but I always wanted to go further. 

It wasn‚Äôt really about him being chubby but it was his unhealthy habits that were a dealbreaker. I couldn‚Äôt picture anything sustainable with him and felt that he would definitely grow larger and worse off with time."
1339,Exercising has been a huge part of my life from they day I was really young. You could say that working out is half my life. I don't demand that my partners lose weight and being chubby doesn't automatically disqualify you as potential partner but it does drop the chances by quite some bit. Also there is a limit to how chubby someone is. Generally speaking weight is not a huuuge factor but it certainly plays a role.
1340,"I like outdoor activities and working out in general so I like having a partner to share that with. I'm not into any particular look per se, but I do want my partner to be healthy and take care of himself and be active. I am pretty sure being chubby isn't the same as being unfit though, so that is quite okay."
1341,"I like my men to be in good physical shape. I realize that as one ages it becomes much more difficult to keep a perfectly toned physique. IMO-But, it is still important for men to do their best to keep healthy as they become older. I can‚Äôt stand it when a man sits around and gets a big belly, drinks heavily, smokes, eats junk food, never exercises, and then complains about his health issues."
1342,I'm only attracted to men who are fit and who prioritize fitness like I do. I couldn't see myself with a non fit guy. I tried and there was just zero physical attraction.
1343,"I feel like this question is really slanting towards the attractive/unattractive angle, but I don't work out to look good. I work out because my hobbies require a level of physical fitness - rock climbing, skiing, backpacking, etc. I would struggle to date someone who could not join me in any of my hobbies if he was not fit enough to even attempt them. I want a partner in adventure, not someone who stays at home doing their own thing and waits for me to get back."
1344,"I refuse to be responsible for someone who refuses to take care of himself. That means a decent diet, a decent amount of some activity, no smoking, no/moderate drinking, etc. 

Yes, ‚Äúin sickness and in health.‚Äù That‚Äôs not an invitation to up the odds that the ‚Äúsickness‚Äù part of life will start sooner, be more severe, and last longer by not taking basic steps to maintain health. You don‚Äôt go drive straight into a tree just because you have car insurance. Similarly, you should not stop caring for yourself just because you have someone who has promised to care for you should the worst happen. 

I run marathons. My husband likes to bike casually and has taken to yoga, but he is not dedicated to fitness the way I am. However, he recognizes his responsibility to me to take care of himself to avoid imposing a preventable burden on me, and so he makes an effort to work out. Similarly, I like whiskey a little too much. I cut back out of consideration for the preventable burden that habit could impose on my husband over time. 

In a lifelong partnership, bad habits are selfish, plain and simple."
1345,"I'm 5'2"", 100lbs, and am physically fit and I typically date bigger guys. Taller and physically bigger/built guys are my thing. Physically fit people don't always gravitate towards the same and vice versa. 

Looks aren't everything and honestly, I'd rather have a chubby SO compared to a very skinny SO. Is chubby/a few extra pounds my ideal body type? No, but as long as they are a good person and healthy, it's not a deal breaker. Personality is more important than looks.

EDIT: Yay, thanks for all the cake day messages!"
1346,"I naturally have a good body, I don't work out and I dated several ""chubby"" people. 

Honestly the stigma breaks my heart, as the person I am dating is the sweetest person ever, they are sexy and they are the kindest soul I've met. 
Laying on them is very comfy, sex is great, everywhere I grab there's something to hold onto, sleeping in their arms is amazing.

I don't have any resentment, sometimes I am including more healthy food in meals I cook, as they tend to eat only sweets and carbs and then feel terrible about their body. But they love the meals I cook because they know I am not trying to change them, that's just the way I cook and take care of the people I love.

I also dated several chubby girls and they are very sexy, kind, sassy, hilarious, amazing. In bed, it was super hot. We all have bodies, with different marks, I really don't care about stretch marks etc.
I dated also several fit people and I find it less fun, as they tend to take themselves extremely seriously and be more rigid in their ways."
1347,I'm usually in very good shape and honestly I love my husband for who he is not what he looks like. So long as he can keep up with me on hikes and such I don't care what he looks like. I draw the line at someone who can't keep up or refuses to do the things I like because they don't want to do physical activity. Though despite being the more fit looking one in the relationship truth be told my husband is in way better shape he can still lift me like I weigh nothing and on a hike I stop for breaks more frequently than he does.
1348,"He wasn‚Äôt overweight when we got married. I think he‚Äôs gained 50 pounds since we started dating and a good 30 since marriage.  I don‚Äôt like it. Its doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with how attractive I find him, because I love him, it‚Äôs just really hard watching someone you love treat their bodies like absolute shit and eat Quarter Pounders for breakfast."
1349,"I prefer women who work out, partly because I find them more attractive, and also because working out is a big part of my life and I'd want a partner who is also a fitness nut üí™"
1350,"I‚Äôm naturally thin without having to do anything and my SO has always struggled with his weight and diet.  It only bothers me when he projects his own insecurities about his weight, fitness level or diet on to me.  That pisses me off.  He‚Äôs still a very physically attractive man no matter what size he is.  He‚Äôs blessed with flawless skin, could be considered Mediterranean and almost boyish facial features."
1351,"I'm pretty fit, and I dont see myself dating someone who basically doesnt excercise (I'm referring to healthy people who dont want to be a certain size that I consider fit or near it). I am dating someone whose not as fit, but he takes care of himself and hes healthy. Hes not chubby, he has what I call a bit of fat but I find it normal. 

I dont need an athlete body, that's nice and all but I do want to see someone who eats healthy, and moves around where the fat doesnt build up and then it becomes difficult to lose that weight."
1352,"I am pretty fit and active, and tend to stay pretty skinny for my height. 

&#x200B;

I married a guy who is pretty fit and active and stays a touch fluffy for his height. 

&#x200B;

We are fit in different ways. I can run father, he can bike longer. I have strong af legs, he has strong af arms. What is incredibly important to me is my partner being active and enjoying staying busy and having outdoorsy types of hobbies. 

Equally important to me is not being so obsessed with your image and fitness that you can never enjoy a pizza with me. 

This is very much a YMMV. For me its more about lifestyle matching than anything."
1353,"I'm petite and decently fit.  I meal prep, sporatic yoga, pilates, some light weights here and there and the elliptical.  My body type for guys are usually slim but fit, my last two bfs were professional dancers so they were really fit.  For women, I like slender to thicc body types.  I prefer to be with someone who takes care of themselves physically because it means they care.  I don't need to be with someone who's a fitness freak but someone who cares about their health.  I've never been attracted to chubby guys but no chubby guys have ever hit on me.  I'm not attracted to overly muscular guys either (too beefy for me)."
1354,"As someone who had to work really hard to build the habits necessary to get fit/healthy, I would not want to date someone who didn't share those goals. It's not so much about how their body looks, since I know eating and exercising well is not a perfect process/it shows on different people different ways (I myself have bad days/weeks and have never been skinny no matter what I ate/how fit I was), but about attitude and support. If I'm not with someone who at the very least supports my lifestyle by being up for activities other than spending all day in bed/on the couch and encourages me to keep doing what I'm doing, I would definitely struggle to stay active and probably resent them/get depressed. But they definitely don't have to be trim or super fit."
1355,I‚Äôm thin and my husband is not.   That‚Äôs what it is.   He‚Äôs gone up and down and I have loved him thru it all.   No one is perfect.
1356,"It's just not something I'm attracted to. I have nothing against them and am happy to be friends, but I wouldn't feel sexual attraction."
1357,"I'm not attracted to them at all. I'm a health and fitness freak so would like my partner to be into fitness as well, or we just wouldn't be compatible. Not only would I not find them attractive, they wouldn't want to go on all the active holidays I do. I hate sitting around and being lazy, don't do lazy beach holidays either, so I would need someone who shares my passion for being active and healthy. I eat really healthy, so it would be hard to eat together, or even be together if they had an unhealthy lifestyle as it would just clash too much with my healthy one."
1358,I wouldn‚Äôt want to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt value their health. Your body is the only true home you‚Äôll ever have and I think that should be respected.
1359,Not even remotely attracted to men who aren't fit. His body needs to be as good as mine & he has to have that lean muscular look.
1360,"He's has a dad bod. For context, I have more muscle in my quads than his entire body. All my exs/flings had bodybuilding/physique competitor or athletic bodies, as that's my type.

No resentment and it has no affect on our sex life. But, if we weren't friends first, I wouldn't date him. As shallow as it is, I do need to be physically attracted to someone, for that sexual chemistry/side of me to activate. But since I've known him for months as a friend, his personality got to me first.

We've only been together for 3 months so currently I don't mind. However, it does make me wonder if he'll be open to my interests: hiking, sports and eating/cooking clean. I'm fine if he remains this weight. Any more though, and it's bordering unhealthy. In which case I will encourage him to partake in physical activities with me. If he makes no effort or doesn't see why it's important (his wellbeing, quality of life, mortality rate), then it will become an issue."
1361,"I'm still fit and exercise regularly, it's an important part of my life for many reasons. I am attracted to fit men, definitely not chubby. 
Honestly, yes, it bothers me. I resent that part of his attraction to me is because I stayed fit, but he didn't do the same for me. It has affected my sexual attraction at times. 
I will never tell him though. I love him and it would only hurt him, and he needs to find his own internal motivation to get fit."
1362,"Gettin so goddamn tired of hearing this man hate his own body and constantly talk shit about it but never do anything to solve it. I've tried to encourage him for almost a year.

He also lowkey blames me for my food preference but i repeadedly tell him he doesnt have to eat what i do. Which will seem to register when he makes some food i dont like, but not when i get something he considers fattening. 

Tummy gets in way trying to hug and fuck sometimes."
1363,"Once my ex-bf gained weight and became ""chubby"", while I was working out every day and was very fit, I was physically less attracted to him. I still loved him as a person, but once he wasn't wearing any clothes on, I didn't find him attractive. I never told him that though, and I tried to supress those feelings inside of me."
1364,"I‚Äôm not attracted to chubby men. I don‚Äôt need a guy to be built, but I get turned off by overweight. Honestly, I do see it as a lack of a discipline or otherwise we have way different priorities. I‚Äôm a short woman, so my baseline calorie allowance is a sad 1200 calories a day and I don‚Äôt have the advantage of testosterone in muscle building. I just feel like if I can do it, what reason does a taller man have not to?"
1365,"I work out fairly regularly, but I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a healthy eater nor am I in excellent shape. My fianc√© is not like that. I have absolutely no issues with his appearance, but I do wish he‚Äôd like to do more active activities with me."
1366,"I've been with some out-of-shape, chubby fellas. It's not the body shape itself that is unattractive to me - it's the things that lead to it, in my personal experience. Sedentary lifestyle, a procastinating sort of mentality, a lot of exhaustion or exessive alcohol in their life, and *terrible* cardio that leaves me drenched in their sweat after *5 minutes of getting it on*. By contrast, the sportier types I've been have insane stamina. There's other things to consider during sex but that's one difference I've seen.

Chubby people can be perfectly attractive but what I'm always striving for is a person that pushes me to be a better version of myself, maybe to the point of trying to catch up to them, and this includes physically. I spent a lot of time being the chubby one in my adolescence and I want to push myself to peak physical performance while I'm alive.

That being said, I'm more concerned with *being* physically fit than if they *look* fit. One of my friends is a pretty big dude, used to be very overweight, and he's basically been living in the gym for a few years now. He's a big dude, a bit soft, but there's a lot of strength there. Not every ""fit"" body looks the same way."
1367,"I don‚Äôt mind it as long as they‚Äôre active. My only pet peeves are bigger dudes who are looking for a woman to motivate them. They can‚Äôt keep up with me and then my workout suffers because I‚Äôve got to slow down and hold their hand while they take ‚Äúbaby steps‚Äù. F-that. If they‚Äôre already active and have active hobbies, cool. If not, I‚Äôm not interested in being someone‚Äôs personal manic pixie dream girl helping them to become a better them."
1368,"For me, it's not an issue of chub versus not having any drive. If they aren't driven to improve in any part of their life, usually that carries over to physical health. THAT'S the downer/deal breaker. 


If they talk about working out, but don't follow through... It just gets annoying. If I don't respect the person, the romance isn't going to be there. The chub (not 300+lb obese) doesn't bother me."
1369,I‚Äôm personally not attracted to or interested in an overweight partner. I adhere to a healthy lifestyle so our lifestyles would conflict. I also worry about the long term complications that could arise because of their increased weight. I don‚Äôt want a sickly partner. So for me it‚Äôs a no go.
1370,"I exercise 4-6 times a week when I'm in a routine, I find it important for my mental health. When I first met my current partner, I immediately ruled him out as a romantic prospect because he doesn't exercise and would be considered overweight. But as we got to know each other it became clear to me that I wanted to hang out with this person more than anyone else. 

I'm not gonna lie, I have struggled with it at times, largely in that I worry about his health (although I am conscious that weight is not directly correlated with health, I also know that exercise has many health benefits). Sometimes it is frustrating that he doesn't have as much stamina as I do, and he's not much like any of the other men I'm attracted to. But he likes to hike, walk, and ride bicycles, so we can share those activities. 

It's okay for us to do different things, and I cannot change who he is. Either I accept it or I end the relationship, and the relationship is so good to me in so many other ways. Ultimately, if I were paralyzed and couldn't exercise, it would be more important to me than anything else to have a supportive partner I enjoy hanging out with."
1371,"Chubby like 5-10lbs because we've done nothing but drink beer and eat like shit for 2 weeks on vacation? Fine, that's easily dropped and it's likely that I've gained it too in that scenario. But chubby like 30lbs overweight? That's a no for me. I'm just not attracted to that type and I need to be physically attracted to someone if we're going to be fucking. You don't have to look like a gym god, I know I don't, but I'm a fan of fit."
1372,"We would just not be compatible. You know that meme of Wii fit where the trainer says ""fitness isnt just a hobby, it's a lifestyle""? Well it's partly true. Just trying to get my parents to eat their vegetables is a nightmare I can't imagine being in a relationship where these values dont align up."
1373,"This used to be my situation. Honestly, other people's physical fitness just isn't a big deal to me, including partners. It's a temporary state of being, anyway. Personality and interests (and yeah, attractiveness in some form) are the most important things."
1374,"I don't work out besides the occasional yoga session or cardio. Nothing to sculpt my body more just trying not to be winded after a flight or two of stairs. I'm tall and rather slender so I'd traditionally fit into that category. 
With that being said I absolutely adore a lil extra pudge. I actually prefer it! Most my exes and crushes have fallen into this category and I didn't realize I lean that way until this question was asked. Without getting too carried away I'd like to leave it on this: I like all guys of all shapes sizes and backgrounds. As long as he's relatively active (wouldn't mind hanging out with me/not lazy) and a good guy I have no qualms."
1375,"I‚Äòm not into chubby guys.
I‚Äôm not chasing guys who work out religiously and have perfect abs either (actually guys who work out too much and are all muscles and veins are not my type either). I don‚Äôt mind if a guy has just a flat stomach with no visible abs, I just find it not attractive when a guy has visible fat rolls on his stomach or love handles."
1376,"It's an absolute dealbreaker. I work very hard for my physique, and I only found men attractive if they were in good shape. Until a few years ago, I always thought I was being ridiculous and that this was something I could will myself out of. One time, I dated a guy who was rather out of shape and hardly had any health habits. He even smoked cigarettes. He was otherwise great, and I told myself I was being shallow, so I stuck it out. It ended up completely gutting my motivation to work out. I ended up gaining weight, and ended up very unhappy with my body. This in turn gutted my sex drive and self-esteem. My relationship with this guy didn't last much longer after that. Since then, I've lost all the weight and I'm in even better shape than before. This is not something I will compromise on again."
1377,"My most recent ex before my current boyfriend was a chubby guy who wasn't into fitness. I had 0 issues with it being a physical attraction thing unless that person was significantly overweight. My boyfriend now and I met at the gym. The gym is a huge factor in our lifestyle: we workout, we eat clean, we have goals, we like to compete, and thanks to current world situations, our first project in our house is both of us putting money into a home gym. Those are things that don't really matter when you're dating someone chubby who just doesn't care. I now can talk about fitness with someone whether it's about workouts, mechanics of movements, goals, new PRs, etc. and have someone understand and WANT to talk about it instead of trying to put me down for it because they were disinterested like my ex would."
1378,"I run every day. Usually 50-70 miles a week. I know distance running is an acquired taste. I don‚Äôt care how my fianc√© looks, but I do care if he is physically healthy or not. When we first met he was pretty active ‚Äî not in the way that I am, but he was into sports and worked out maybe 3 days a week. But he‚Äôs gotten increasingly lazy, more video games and junk food with less physical activity. It‚Äôs not about looks for me because someone can be in great shape and be chubby. I just don‚Äôt want him to run into any health issues from being sedentary."
1379,"Having been on both sides of the proverbial fence (I wouldn't say I'm in excellent shape, but I lost about 70 pounds over the past year, am now at a healthy weight and work out most days) I think my standards have changed a little. I've never been overly invested in specific body types for my partners, but now I think I'd pass over someone who was largely sedentary or had poor eating habits regardless of if they were fat or not or how attractive I found them. I know how easily I fall into those patterns myself and how hard it is to break them so the risk isn't really worth it for me."
1380,"I weekly exercise, don‚Äôt drink and eat generally very healthy. The opposite is my BF. He is a little chubby, which he‚Äôs insecure about. He‚Äôs overall an brilliant and loving BF. 

His chubby ness is not a problem, but his lack of exercise and eating and drinking habits drive me insane sometimes. My only concern is his life span not his chubs. I love him so freaking much."
1381,"As long as my SO is able to participate in the activities we like to do together (hiking, kayaking,   biking, tossing the ball/frisbee around) I don't care if he's got some fat on him. It's more about ability than appearance for me. I like to be active but you don't need washboard abs or bulging biceps to be able to do those activities."
1382,"My workout routine and gainz have been completely derailed by quarantine, but I've been maintaining my healthy weight and think I still look pretty good. I don't find chubby people attractive. I just don't. For years I had issues with that as I spent my teenage years on Tumblr and saw the rise of the fat acceptance crowd and I felt guilty about it. How can I not look past it when everyone else seems to? I don't know, but I can't. A little softness is fine--god knows I have some--but overweight is pretty much always a no.

I want to be able to work out next to someone, to lift and/or be lifted by my partner, to have someone who pushes me to be better. If I can't spend all day on my feet with them walking around at my usual pace (fast), I don't want to date them. How could we ever go to events or museums or festivals or on vacation together? I'd make allowances for disability but not for fitness/weight."
1383,"This will probably get buried, but the most important thing to me is mindset regarding health and consumption of food. I am relatively fit, have a good  amount of developed, strong muscle, and am typically rather lean (hovering around 19-20% bf) and I am one of the most unhealthy and disordered people ever when it comes to mindset about food. I have battled with bulimia for years and obsess over food and exercising in a way that is completely bizarre, exhausting, and unhealthful. My SO is a little on the ‚Äúdad bod‚Äù side of things, but his mindset around wellness is 10x more healthy and normal than mine - he eats until he‚Äôs full, then stops. He works out for fun and general wellness, not to compulsively burn calories. All of this is to say, there is an important distinction to be made between skinny and chubby, there‚Äôs also the mental health dimension to consider as well."
1384,"I don‚Äôt care. Chubby can be very sexy, and I don‚Äôt need my partner to have the same fitness goals as me. I don‚Äôt work out to look good though, I work out because I really enjoy it. It‚Äôs a hobby."
1385,I wouldn‚Äôt mind if my man got chunky. I preferred him skinny but now that he‚Äôs put on 30 lbs of muscle I‚Äôm slowly adapting to liking that look more. My taste buds seem to change as he changes haha
1386,"Nope, not into chubby/thicc at all. Automatic disqualification.  Much prefer thin/lean & healthy lifestyle choices."
1387,"I workout about 5 days a week and love lifting heavy. I‚Äôve dated all body types from lean dudes, to body builders, and powerlifters with the extra thickness on them that allows them to lift things 3x their body weights. 

For me, I tend to go towards the thicker guys because there‚Äôs just something attractive to me about the extra cushion and knowing they can lift and shoulder press me like nothing. I think as long as the person I‚Äôm with enjoys a healthy lifestyle it doesn‚Äôt really matter if they hold a little extra weight. (And I‚Äôm a taller- athletic build female for reference.)"
1388,"I‚Äôm fit/athletic and I need someone who is fit/athletic.  I don‚Äôt want to go out with someone who I can change to make them fit.  Aside from that, I‚Äôm not attracted to anyone chubby/overweight.  I understand weight fluctuations, but if you‚Äôre chubby/overweight, you‚Äôve proven that you could possibly disregard your health even further.  I also wouldn‚Äôt go out with someone who had a history of obesity.  I wouldn‚Äôt want them to spiral out of control and relapse because I understand eating disorders and it‚Äôs not a simple ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù issue, it‚Äôs a very serious issue. 

I‚Äôve never been overweight and my current partner hasn‚Äôt, it will always remain this way."
1389,I don't mind being with a man who's on the chubbier side. Looks aren't everything to me.
1390,"I don't date or not date someone based on their weight. I am disappointed when I realize the overweight guy I've been seeing talks a lot about ""losing this gut"" but then never does anything about it and will actually complain at being served a nutritious, healthy meal that involves more veggies than carbs. Then after a while, as I bust my ass in the gym and Couch Potato does nothing at all to better himself, I really start to resent that. I'd be better off limiting my dating to someone who is equally interested in working out and eating healthy, rather than try to fit myself to some dude that realistically, just doesn't fit. We just don't view and approach life in the same way and the underlying attitudes of both of us will eventually belie a fundamental incompatibility."
1391,"Lmao my issue is that like I work out but I‚Äôm like 20 pounds overweight right now and I would rather date fit guys. I don‚Äôt really find chubby guys attractive :/

edit: I got an award! Thank you! Idk how to act lmao"
1392,"I‚Äôm pretty fit and workout regularly. I like a big chubby guy cuz they‚Äôre more comfy to cuddle with, and make me feel extra small which is fun if I‚Äôm being real. If you‚Äôre exceedingly obese however, I‚Äôm not down. There‚Äôs limits to everything"
1393,"I'm attracted to people who are a bit overweight generally, so it's okay."
1394,"I work out a lot. I'm a dancer and have rehearsals/classes almost every day typically, and on the off days I will go to the gym for a cardio/weights work out. My most recent ex was also an athlete (a swimmer), but didn't do anything besides the mandated team work-outs. I wouldn't say the I resented the way he looked, I really didn't care. I more-so had an issue with the fact that he would constantly make comments about how he was ""definitely more fit"" and ""we could never work-out together because he would have to slow down so I could catch-up."""
1395,"My SO has gained maybe about 25-30 lbs this past year. We used to be very active together, but he lost interest and now I just workout by myself. I absolutely adore him and through my eyes, he is just so damn sexy and handsome. I‚Äôm constantly all over him because honestly, I don‚Äôt even see him has chubby. I‚Äôm not too sure what‚Äôs going on, but he‚Äôs definitely going through something. He‚Äôs easily angered and his sex drive has decreased tremendously. I‚Äôve tried talking to him about it, but he‚Äôs the type who doesn‚Äôt like to share his problems."
1396,"I'm an extremely active person, and honestly, as long as my significant other can keep up with me hiking/backpacking/snowboarding/etc, I don't really care. As long as they're healthy, I'm cool with it.

&#x200B;

I'm also terrified of very buff people, so that's definitely a no go zone for me."
1397,"I work out most days and staying active in general . Eating healthy, living in a balance is extremely important to me. I don't mind him being bigger but if he eats crap and doesn't exercise (I love exercising together also!)  I guess it's just not my thing.. You gotta care about your health and body to pass the test!"
1398,I'm super into fitness and nutrition - I've done a ton of Crossfit for years and I play sports. I think I could only date another woman who's also into fitness and working out to some extent so we can share our lifestyle and motivate each other. Certainly wouldn't want to date someone out of shape.
1399,"In 2018 I ended a 6 year relationship like this. While the weight wasn‚Äôt the biggest issue, I felt it was a symptom of a larger problem. He always just seemed to be fine with doing the bare minimum. In terms of cleaning, exercise, career, budgeting I always had higher dreams and priorities for myself and I honestly believe the relationship was holding me back from my full potential. While I don‚Äôt think this is true in all cases of having a chubby partner, I would definitely recommend considering whether it shows a pattern in their motivational level to be the best version of themselves as well as trying to be the best partner for you"
1400,"Some women like a ‚ÄúPooh Bear tummy‚Äù and some people have a fetish about squishy/plus-size partners. 
I am not one of those people."
1401,"i'm attracted to strength more than anything else...i'm a lifter and am pretty ripped, and i'm honestly not attracted at all to skinny men, or dad bods. if i think i could lift more than a guy, he is instantly unattractive to me haha. i'm also definitely attracted more to strong/fit women, rather than thin or chubby. i keep myself in good shape, and fitness is important to me, so i look for partners with the same values.

i don't care about fluff as long as they're strong as hell. in fact, i would say the ""bear"" body type is kind of my ideal for men...big beefy arms are my weakness lol. so, powerlifters and thicc bodybuilders for men and women alike, though i don't like the super shredded look, mostly because i know how miserable and dehydrated those people are lmao."
1402,"I‚Äôm a fit 42yo female and my SO is overweight, but he‚Äôs a tradesman so he‚Äôs got that ‚Äòfat but muscular‚Äô body type... kind of like a rugby player I guess? It doesn‚Äôt bother me, although I am concerned for his health more than anything as I don‚Äôt want him to die early due to bad health.  That‚Äôs the only reason I wish he‚Äôd stop having sugary drinks."
1403,"I stay pretty fit. But I do not like fat men. I am sorry. I know I seem shallow. That is just my preference. A belly is really low on my list tho. But if they have amazing hands! I can and have fell for guys based only on their hands. Dated one guy, was a blazing narcissistic drunk, had amazing hands."
1404,"My husband and I have been together for 10 years, married for 5, and I've seen him fluctuate in his weight in that time. I'm naturally pretty slim, but I had two babies in that time (1 and 3) so my weight has fluctuated as well, but related only to the pregnancies. I am pretty much back to normal right now, which is 130 at 5'9"".  I do not care what weight he is, I don't care if he's chubby, I'm very attracted to him as a person, and to his personality. I feel zero resentment toward him because I don't have to try to lose weight, it comes easily to me, so it's not like I'm working at it and he's not. I don't think his weight impacts our sex life apart from that if he works out or goes for a run, he always comes back with a higher libido."
1405,"I got to go through this with my ex-husband. When I was out of shape I dated anywhere from extremely skinny to obese with no preference. I got married to a man who wouldn't even be considered overweight, mild dad bod at most. In that time, I started doing triathlons and then ultramarathons. I put on muscle and lost fat. He started running too and lost weight but never gained muscle tone, then got an injury that ended his running, gaining weight back to where he was when we first dated. What was fine then was now no longer attractive. It wasn't why we divorced, but my increasing lack of attraction exacerbated existing issues. I was indeed resentful, feeling like here I was taking good care of my body and he refused to try any other forms of exercise when he couldn't run and just let himself go.

Now I pretty much exclusively am attracted to extremely skinny guys. If my boyfriend were to gain significant fat (not raw weight) I'd probably have the same attraction issues. And I'm almost as turned off by very muscular guys as I am severely overweight guys.

However, skinny without being active is equally a turnoff. I want someone who can hike all day with me, who looks at new physical challenges as fun/exciting rather than a burden. I will definitely take a little extra weight for that zest for movement."
1406,"I‚Äôm lucky that I find it very easy to maintain a low body fat percentage. My metabolism has slowed a bit since I‚Äôm in my late 30‚Äôs now, but as long as I somewhat watch my diet and work out a few times a week, it‚Äôs easy for me to drop a few pounds and develop muscle definition pretty quickly. I usually work out or play sports at least three or four times a week.

My fianc√© has the opposite build. He is a naturally gifted athlete. In high school he played and excelled in every sport. Track, soccer, basketball, baseball, football, hockey, he did it all. He played hockey at a semi-pro level into his mid-20‚Äôs. But while he puts on muscle very easily, he also has a tendency to gain fat very easily. And after a lifetime of so much intense physical activity was replaced with a sedentary desk job, he started putting on the pounds. 

He was in the worst shape of his life when we met and started dating, but I fell in love with him regardless. I have to admit that it took some getting used to at first. I had always dated very fit looking guys and he was pretty chubby. We still had a good sex life but it bothered me that he didn‚Äôt prioritize his health as much as I wished he would. Instead, he would drink several beers every time he hung out with his friends, eat whole bags of candy and popcorn, or whole pints of ice cream, all habits from his more athletic days when he could consume whatever he wanted and still be solid muscle. He showed me an old photo of him where he had an eight-pack for God‚Äôs sake. I was like damn, why can‚Äôt I have that version of him? I did feel a bit of resentment that he got to enjoy me in the best shape of my life, while I got him in his worst shape. 

A while back, he suffered a couple of joint injuries and started having some other health problems, and it was a huge wake up call. He has since cut back on drinking and eating unhealthy food, and started working out regularly again. He‚Äôs the fittest looking that I‚Äôve ever seen him, though still a long way from an eight-pack, and I‚Äôm very happy and crazy about his ‚Äúdad bod.‚Äù He is still working to drop another ten pounds. 

I just hope this lifestyle change is going to stick, especially since we want to start a family soon and I want us both to be healthy and active well into our old age together. If he ever ‚Äúlets himself go‚Äù again, I have to admit I‚Äôd be really sad and disappointed. I think it‚Äôs important that couples keep fit for each other‚Äôs sake, to maintain both health and attraction."
1407,"I am not attracted to chubby dudes and any sort of belly turns me off. sad but true, I can't find anything attractive about someone letting themselves go like that."
1408,"I (f) work my butt off for the body I have and I love it. I‚Äôm as skinny as I was in high school and fitness is my passion. I have cheat days but I‚Äôm really mindful of what I eat. One of my most recent exes was pretty thin when we met over summer, he didn‚Äôt have a 6 pack or anything but he was lean. I don‚Äôt know what happened but over the holidays and winter he put on 25 lbs, mostly from eating fast food a lot and sitting on his butt playing video games and drinking malt beer every night. I have to say I became pretty resentful, and it made me re think my future with him. I do prefer thin guys but also from a health aspect... it was a huge turn off for my significant other to completely disregard their health like that, especially when I‚Äôm the opposite and work hard to make sure I look good for him and myself."
1409,"I have a high BMR, effortlessly slim. I do have some small insecurities about my body (height and color) but it hardly matters. For partners, I'm usually attacted to fit athletic guys. My SO works out more than I do for health reasons, so he stays fit too. He did gain a lot of weight twice though (like 30 kg) and I was worried he was getting unhealthy but never thought of him as unattractive. I thought the chubbiness was an interesting cute phase.

Tldr: Initial attraction is 100% always towards athletic fit guys, but if we date and he gains weight I don't really mind, I'm still into the guy. I worry for his health and push him into a workout session until he's fit again though"
1410,"Regardless of how much they weigh, it never works out for me to date someone who doesn‚Äôt workout. They don‚Äôt understand why I choose to be fit- and they usually take it as a personal attack on their own lifestyle habits. Or they wonder ‚Äúwho‚Äù I‚Äôm trying to look good for.

That being said, I like stocky thicc men- but they have to work out and be strong, or it just won‚Äôt work out."
1411,"I have always been in semi-good shape. I have a fast metabolism and fat/muscle seems to end up in all the right places so I look proportionate. 

Before my current boyfriend, all of the men I dated previously were on the chubbier end. Not morbidly obese, but they all had a beer belly, ‚Äúman boobs‚Äù, didn‚Äôt work out so little muscle, etc. I don‚Äôt think I ever noticed until I started dating my current SO.

A couple times, friends made a passive-aggressive comment on my ex‚Äôs‚Äô weights while I was dating them (ie. ‚Äúbe careful he doesn‚Äôt squish you when he rolls over in bed‚Äù) but I just blew them off as being rude and unnecessary.

My current SO is fit. He works security and is very lean but has a wide build and is muscular. A few months into dating, I noticed and went ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre lean! You look good!‚Äù Now I notice it all the time and constantly compliment him.

Looking back, I realize my exes were bigger but I think I just don‚Äôt pay a lot of attention to body. I focus on the face and hair (I have a thing for long hair on dudes). I never felt any kind of resentment to my exes and I don‚Äôt think I would be resentful if my current SO put on some weight as long as he‚Äôs still healthy and has the little ponytail lol"
1412,"Lol I feel like the reverse is true in my relationship. I'm in great shape as is my SO, but he has a literal 6 or 8 pack and is on the lean-muscular side, whereas I'm fit/thin but in some people's eyes, I am ""thick"" (but mainly where curves are at - boobs, butt, thighs, soccer legs... I have a flat stomach). 

My SO prefers my body type to a girl who's athletic sans curves, or a girl who's super skinny. It really confused me at first, because I felt men were conditioned to want super-skinny girls only (it's what women in my life told me). Yet all the guys in my life (family mainly) gravitate towards ""curvy slim-thick"". Could be a social circles thing though because I've noticed some guys of certain cliques are into that 00s super-skinny look.

Me personally, I never minded ""thick"" on a guy. I don't like *overweight* but my idea of overweight is lenient. If a guy is tall and built, he could be ""overweight"" but I don't see it that way? I highly dislike the skinny look on guys. It's way less appealing to me."
1413,"Everyone has their own type. Some ‚Äúfit‚Äù people like others like them, some like chubby, some like bigger people. It‚Äôs all based on personal preference. And there is fit women who like chubbier guys."
1414,"I'm a super active person. I hate sitting around with nothing to do. I run a few miles almost every day, I want to hike, and camp, or trail ride bikes, anything when its nice out.  I don't care if if my partner isn't in the same shape as me, but they need to at least try and be active with me.  

I don't even need them to do everything with me. But at least make an effort to go, and definitely don't expect me to sit around all weekend and watch TV with you.  

This year so far has been a killer for me.  I was sick at the end of December with bronchitis, and I coughed so hard I broke a rib, that led to pneumonia. At some point getting over that, I fractured 4 more ribs.  I've been stuck inside for like 4 months now, and told I can do anything for strenuous then walking..."
1415,"I don't mind as much the details of what he looks like as much as what he does. I've been extremely attracted to guys with a little extra who are tackling impressive athletic goals, and turned off by fit guys who stopped working out (retired from sports, got out of the army etc). I am not compatible with anyone not tackling fitness goals (no matter what they are), it's a core part of what attracts me to someone. I've been attracted to skinny AF ultramarathon runners, dad bod cross country skiers, and slightly chubby powerlifters and sprint cyclists. I've rejected many hot and muscular guys who don't do physical things."
1416,"I am a small woman and I have a chubby SO now (I weigh 100 lbs. and he weighs about 275 lbs.) I actually prefer chubby men to thin or ‚Äúbuff‚Äù men. I‚Äôm a physically affectionate person and to me a chubby guy is nicer to hug and I like the way it feels when he holds me close to him. Also I have dated really fit guys and the ones I have dated were quite vain. I once dated a really fit guy who told me he was in a relationship with a woman for almost a month before he saw her naked. When he saw she had cellulite on her legs and her ass he dumped her. I may have a good body now, but I never want to be valued more or less because of it. I would rather be with a man who does not prioritize appearances. And no, it doesn‚Äôt impact my sex life in a negative way. Each person is different and I approach my sexual partners as individuals. A little extra girth is no problem for me."
1417,"It has honestly never bothered me. I run lean and I work out everyday, being in shape and having a clean diet has always been something that is important to me.

While I have dated men that come in practically every shape and size under the sun, for whatever reason my longer-term relationships (1 to 20 years) tend to be chubby and fluffy.

I date people that I am mentally and emotionally attracted to. Physical attraction is honestly the very last thing on the list. It is nowhere as important to me as the mental and emotional attraction.

Do I wish they were in better shape? Yes.
Is there resentment? Not really. 
Am I attracted to chubby people? Like do I seek them out? No.
Does it have any affect on our sex life? Zero."
1418,I love me some dad bod
1419,"I don't mind chubby, but i do not like overweight"
1420,"I‚Äôve been active since I was 5 years old, with dance, acrobatics, sports and then working out on my own. I‚Äôm athletic, but I‚Äôve gained a bit of fat throughout my university years that doesn‚Äôt make me look like a twig anymore. My bf whom I‚Äôve been dating for nearly 5 and a half years (we‚Äôre both 21) is chubby, he wasn‚Äôt very chubby when I started dating him but over the years he has gained some weight. I honestly don‚Äôt mind it at all, to me he‚Äôs sexy and I love his soft belly, it‚Äôs great for snuggling. He‚Äôs got muscular arms and legs naturally but he‚Äôs not very fit. He‚Äôs got the dad bod. However, he‚Äôs started working out almost daily and I‚Äôm really proud of him. To be honest, as long as he‚Äôs healthy that‚Äôs all that matters to me, he could have a 6 pack or a big belly, doesn‚Äôt matter one bit, he‚Äôs the love of my life and I‚Äôll love him and support him no matter what."
1421,"My SO is chubs (in shape and a cyclist, but just a bit fluffy) and I'm extremely thin (family is all thin and I'm a recovering anorexic) He's just a big teddy bear when my bony ass can't get comfy. Softest, warmest pillow ever and I'm happy."
1422,"I work out every day. Personally, it wouldn't matter to me what level of fitness my SO was in, but rather their attitude and behaviors toward taking care of themselves. Do they eat relatively well, do they do any daily activity rather than sit around all day? I would just want to see that they were taking care of themselves rather than treating their body like crap."
1423,"I'm skinny and I work out (these things are  not connected since I haven't been exercising regularly most of my life). Honestly I am attracted to chubby (as in overweight) women but not men. Idk why this is, I feel kind of bad because lots of bigger guys are cute and have great personalities, but it's just not what I'm into physically, and I need there to be physical attraction from the start.

However I don't have any specific 'type' so if I met a guy whose personality was attractive to me it wouldn't matter if they had a bit of a dad bod or eventually gained some weight, everyone gets old eventually and looks don't matter at that point."
1424,"i have a very lean body, i was blessed with it. but i dont think i could ever have a chubby SO. i like dad bodies and guys with a lot of muscle but i dont like if they have chubby cheeks or no neck yk? people say im fat shaming cause of this but they really just arent my type."
1425,"I used to be an avid CrossFitter/yoga/hiker/runner 6 days a week and was pretty ripped. I loved feeling strong and healthy. My boyfriend now husband is a sheet metal worker who is in decent shape because of his trade, but also gives no fucks. I really didn‚Äôt care about his pudge or that he never touched a barbell, everything I did was for me, so I could feel sexy and empowered. I was occasionally bothered by his poor habits because I wanted him to feel good too, not because I wanted to change his body."
1426,I like to keep fit and need someone to keep up with me. The guys I dated who were chubby or gained weight as we dated were often critical of my diet and exercise. I‚Äôd always end up doing things that made me feel unhealthy to make them feel better. I also just don‚Äôt find it attractive on men. I‚Äôm only into athletic bodies.
1427,"I don't think I'd care, at least not as far as aesthetics go, but I would want us to have a compatible lifestyle. If he was ""chubby"" because he didn't like working out and being healthy, I don't think we'd be good in the long term."
1428,"For me it‚Äôs more about can you go for a 10+ mile hike with me or are you going to start complaining at mile 2? Can we go for a 30+ mile bike ride together? I want to be able to enjoy some of my hobbies with my significant other so it‚Äôs more about physical abilities than size for me. Although I will say, I prefer toned to chunky.

It‚Äôs also lifestyle. I would never date someone who‚Äôs ideal weekend is going out to the bars with friends and then spending the next day nursing a hang over from the couch playing video games. I want my partner and I to be out doing something with our free time."
1429,I‚Äôm in the military and have no choice but to stay in shape. To me it comes down more to lifestyle. There are plenty of guys in the military on the chubby side but still eat well and workout regularly. As long as I can stay in good physical condition with my partner it doesn‚Äôt bother me.
1430,My type is not chubby men nor ripped man. I like skinny slim guys. However I know many of my gfs like the chubbier bod. It really depends on taste. Although it might be true that if you‚Äôre a girl you‚Äôre likely to like someone resembles your father. And mother for boys. It‚Äôs a psychological thing.
1431,"I think it‚Äôs a natural selection thing. I‚Äôm naturally drawn to leaner guys because in my mind offspring will have similar genes (not that I want offspring). 
Also, a major element of relationships involves spending time together. I spend most of my free time in the gym and eating healthier options. I kind of naturally expect my S/O to have a similar lifestyle. I don‚Äôt want him to impose unhealthy habits on me and I don‚Äôt want to force him to unwillingly follow my habits."
1432,"I've known my husband for nearly 15 years. In high school he was a string bean. When we got married, he was around 280#. I fell in love with the man, his weight didn't matter. I work 10 hour shifts at the hospital, then workout after. I told him that I don't care what he looks like, as long as he is healthy so we can have a long, happy marriage together."
1433,I‚Äôm way more into the dad bod type than those that look they live in a gym. I want my partner to be healthy and take care of himself but I‚Äôm a very very low maintenance female and could not be with a man who isn‚Äôt the same.
1434,"I consider myself very in shape, I go to the gym daily for almost 2 hours each time. My partner is a lil chubby‚Äîhe hasn‚Äôt gone to the gym in years, but he‚Äôs not obese or overweight, he‚Äôs just a lil chubby. Sometimes I notice it, but it doesn‚Äôt change how I feel about him. I‚Äôm still attracted to him regardless and it doesn‚Äôt make any difference in our relationship (other than me inviting him to go to the gym with me and him turning it down‚Äîbut to be clear, it does NOT bother me that he turns it down. everyone has their preferences). He does make it a point to say that I can probably kick his ass and lift more than he can, and he makes jokes about me being able to fight off any threat. I‚Äôm not *exclusively* attracted to chubby men; I find muscular men wildly attractive. 

I reflect on my old relationships and I realize that I really have only dated chubby men. I‚Äôve been FWB with fit and muscular men, but never dated them seriously. I think it honestly just might be me believing that all stereotypically hot and muscular are douche bags, but I digress."
1435,"Also a person can be both ‚Äúfat‚Äù and fit. My ex was always a big guy, tall, broad, belly, the whole thing. BUT he loved sport and was actually very active. Actually much more active than me. He just also loved beer and pasta!"
1436,"Looks always fade, pay attention to what is inside."
1437,"My metabolism is really fast. I try to eat consciously (no sweets and soda) and get a little exercise here and there. so my body type is athletic/petite at 122lbs  My fiance (aka greatest man to ever live) is on the chubbier side, like 250lbs+ I think he is THE MOST handsome man in the world, and adore the sh** out of him. Physical attraction is no problem, I am a chubby chaser."
1438,"I just got out of a relationship with a chubby guy and I have to say that it was one of the reasons I left. He was chubby when I fell in love with him too, so it‚Äôs not about the looks at all. But when I‚Äôm a semi professional athlete, and he gets out of breath from the most simple of things, something‚Äôs up.. 

I want to live my life in an active way, be outside, do my sport, hike, live. And he mostly wanted to be inside, maybe watch Netflix. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, but it‚Äôs not the life I want to live. On top of that he had some major health issues, that he really should live a healthy lifestyle in order to aid, and he just didn‚Äôt. And when I tried to motivate him to make better choices, it almost seemed like he resented me for it. 

There were other things wrong with our relationship, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but his disregard for his health and through that, his weight, was in the end quite important."
1439,"I‚Äôd much rather having a chubby partner who is otherwise awesome, than having a fit partner who doesn‚Äôt satisfy me emotionally"
1440,"I feel MEAN answering this lol but I‚Äôve been in two successive relationships where this was the case. 

I‚Äôll start by saying neither of them were/are grossly overweight. My most recent ex boyfriend was just a big lad - chubby but 6‚Äù4, and also had quite a lot of muscle underneath as he lifted weights. He was aware he was carrying a fair bit of extra poundage and joked about it. He also did a lot to keep it at bay, he watched his diet mostly, and went for the occasional run when he had time. For these two reasons it never bothered me in the slightest. If he was insecure about his appearance and moaned about it, but never took action, it would be slightly more difficult to respect his choices and lifestyle. 

He actually got me into the gym though. I‚Äôm one of those obnoxious people that is slim naturally, but he taught me how to use all the machines and now I love going! 

My current boyfriend is also carrying extra weight he doesn‚Äôt want, but he too is very aware and is just now starting keto and IF. This all comes off his own back, I would never tell a person to diet, and I‚Äôm so happy and excited for him about his plans! 

What it comes down to is attitude. Do I care if you‚Äôre a bit overweight? No, I personally like a man to be a bit bigger (I like unkempt, unshaven types, and I actually find super groomed and toned men a turn off). Would I care if they were unhappy but weren‚Äôt doing anything about it? Yes, that would bother me a lot, because it would be unnecessary negativity. I know it‚Äôs a cliche, but confidence and a sense of self is the sexiest thing by a mile."
1441,"I am not attracted to overweight people, but it's interesting reading the other responses."
1442,I‚Äôm not attracted to chubby/fat men and pot bellies. It‚Äôs not that difficult to be fit.
1443,I love some chub
1444,"I naturally have an hourglass figure and genes to look super fit really fast, ie I go to the gym twice and get asked by women for my routine. 

I like men to workout, ideally if we can lift together that‚Äôs hot. That said, the main thing I love on a man is nice arms. I‚Äôve dated a guy that wasn‚Äôt chubby really but had a little extra love on him and I really enjoyed it for snuggling because I could rub his tummy. He was also always warm.

After him I dated a naturally shredded guy who was probably 4% body fat at most, really good looking nice body but I hated cuddling him because it felt like laying on a remote. I don‚Äôt recommend it.

Last guy I dated was super built and had huge muscles, sexy body but wasn‚Äôt quite as lean and i really liked his body. Snuggling was good but his chest wasn‚Äôt quite as comfy to lay my head on. He had a most comparable body to my boyfriend in high school who had a really banging fit body but also not too lean and was good for snuggles. 

Overall, body type on men does matter and although I date more fit guys that tend to be jacked it is NOT everything to me. I way prefer a little tummy on my man if he has some strong arms to pick me up with over some model type guy that I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôm sleeping on the ground outside next to him. Plus if we are dating I‚Äôd want to feed my man anyway because I like him. Overall what matters is generally taking care of yourself but if you‚Äôre a little chunky and super confident and kind to me it doesn‚Äôt matter. Plus again cuddling is important."
1445,"I honestly just have the metabolism of a freight train, and thats why i look super skinny and fit. But my boyfriend isnt super fit, though hes trying to be, and does have a bit of gut. Honestly i dont mind it one bit. I thought i would but i honestly dont. If he were to get like, huge i would probably have an issue, but a bit of a gut doesnt bother me. If anything i like it because hes squishy and nice to cuddle up with. But thats just me.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
1446,"It depends on what you mean by ""chubby"". 10-15 extra pounds isn't a big deal. Clinically  overweight or even obese... not attractive IMHO. 

Why aren't they in good shape? Do they have a poor diet? Do they sit on the couch all day? 

Both of those things would be an automatic turn off for me. I could never be attracted to someone who would literally risk their health for the sake of potato chips and TV."
1447,"I don't mind if he's had a few extra pounds, after all who wants to date somebody who's in better shape than I am?  However, when the Ex went from 'could stand to lose some weight' to 'obese fat ass' I dumped him.  After all, the stoic Brutus wrote 'mastering one's appetite is the foundation of self control.'"
1448,"I care about their health and I'm willing to help them go plant-based if there's a potemtial health risk, but I don't mind if I'm attracted to them and love them for their mind/personality."
1449,"For one...I work out to look and feel great all the time üòÉüòÖüëè

I have no problems with weight, the factor that I consider is how their body reveals the time and effort (or lack of) invested in caring for their things and life, and therefore their partner. Again, not about the number...it‚Äôs what is behind as far as mindset and habits."
1450,[removed]
1451,"I am not in excellent shape, but I do make an effort to exercise several times a week, and my diet has been mostly balanced for years now. Overall I‚Äôm much healthier than my bf.

I‚Äôve always been attracted to dad bods and the general personalities that go along with them. I enjoy that they eat or drink a little bit too much. I def don‚Äôt see six pack  abs and think wow I wanna be with a guy like that! Or wow I‚Äôm so wet now. It‚Äôs just like eh ok cool, if they have them."
1452,"I love him. It doesn't count he is chubby. He has personality, humour, and I never was into muscular dudes. For me, muscular is similarly indifferent as chubby."
1453,"I've recently started out working regularly and toned my body.My bf and me had been netflix and chilling at home way too much. I thought my being motivated would rub off on him, but he seems to be carrying on with unhealthy habits :( he has gained about 10kg over 4 years and I don't really like how out of shape he has become. I gained some weight last year and I did something about it. I just wish he would too."
1454,"I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm exceptionally fit, but I do exercise almost everyday and am pretty petite. My husband‚Äôs dad bod is perfect to me. We‚Äôve been together a long time and have both fluctuated over time, but I love the way he looks. He‚Äôs the right size for the perfect cuddle."
1455,I spent years competing in my sport and working out at least 5 days a week. I‚Äôve always just liked my man to be a little chubby. I like bigger built guys and I think the extra body mass looks really good. My so doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs hot but I can‚Äôt get enough of him. He‚Äôs an insecure angel and we‚Äôre working on it.
1456,I‚Äôm allll about a little bit of chub
1457,"Chubby doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. I am not into the extremely fit/ripped thing. I‚Äôve had dated men of all of shapes and sizes. My current husband used to workout, but he was more bulky if that makes sense? After I had our daughter he put working out on the back burner and I couldn‚Äôt care less. I told him he could gain 30lbs and I‚Äôd still be attracted to him. And he really hasn‚Äôt, but his midsection did get a bit more round. As long as he‚Äôs showering and brushing his teeth, body size doesn‚Äôt bother me. It really is all about the inside of a person for me. As long as his personality and love for me doesn‚Äôt change, I‚Äôll be happy. Oh, and healthy of course!"
1458,"I'm working out and have a pretty good body. My boyfriend was in decent shape when we started dating but due to life and full time job he gained a lot of weight. 

Sometimes I wish he would go to gym with me but I know it has to be his decision. Our relationship is great and his weight doesn't change the fact that I love him more than anything. :)"
1459,"I care a lot more about physical health habits than how someone actually looks, male or female. 

I am not attracted to a lot of the habits than can make someone fat, but if someone practices good habits and strives for good health an improvement, then I don't really care how they actually look.

I also just really love sharing common interests and I really enjoy cooking, nutrition, and pretty much every type of exercise. I love sharing these interests with my partner and knpwing we both enjoy them."
1460,"It doesn‚Äôt bother me, I knew what he looked like when I met him and I thought he was hot af. I make sure we eat healthy meals while making sure we indulge ourselves too. I make sure we cut some bad stuff from our diet by making sure we don‚Äôt have it at home, like soda. I encourage him to go on productive walks with me, like to the post office to pick up mail and do some yoga with me every once in a while. I‚Äôm naturally fit, thanks to DNA and I prefer fresh healthy foods so I‚Äôm not fit because I do a lot of shit and I‚Äôm certainly not going to demand he put more effort in than I‚Äôm willing to do myself. I want him to be healthy, but healthy doesn‚Äôt always mean skinny- I just want him comfortable in his own skin (whatever that means to him) and next to me for a damn long time."
1461,"I don‚Äôt care at all. I was working out regularly before we dated and he was still chubby. There‚Äôs no resentment at all. Sometimes I wish we could work out together but I also love having it as my own hobby. My ex was really into fitness and it turned into him criticizing my body and eating habits. No thanks. I used to even work at a gym surrounded by huge buff dudes, they couldn‚Äôt compare to my amazing man."
1462,"I‚Äôm not like ripped or anything, and I could stand to lose 10 pounds, but my SO is about 100 lbs more than me and 3‚Äù taller.  It usually doesn‚Äôt bother me. He‚Äôs healthy (arguable healthier than me in some areas), so I‚Äôm not worried about that. I think whenever I start thinking negatively about his body, it‚Äôs actually just my own insecurities that I‚Äôm projecting onto him. Most times it doesn‚Äôt even cross my mind though. Probably hits on days where I‚Äôm obsessed over my own weight, and it runs over into seeing other people‚Äôs bodies too (not just my SO‚Äôs)."
1463,"I don't work out a ton (only occasionally) but people think I do since i have a tight stomach area and toned stomach muscles just passively. I do like guys who put a lot of effort into their physical appearances by working out because it motivates me to do the same. I don't usually, so having that motivation is good. Ive noticed into adult life that a lot of people gain weight due to just making life style choices that lead to a more sedentary lifestyle (the physical labor job you take as a college freshman vs. Your grown up job of accountant for example). So i understand weight gain and loss and wouldn't ask a guy to lose weight unless it got to be a real problem."
1464,"I'm a fairly fit runner/sports player. I feel like this comes down to shared values. How important is it for you to share the same health & fitness values with your partner - how high is that on your priority list? To me, a fit man is a reflection of shared priorities.

I'd like my man to be able to keep up with my hiking, even be able to out-perform and push me. If I'd like to spend an afternoon climbing, playing volleyball, or getting in a 10 miler, I'd love for him to love to go with me. I'm naturally attracted to fitness, and not at all attracted to lifestyles that lend themselves to extra weight gain."
1465,"My bf is definitely chubby - however, he works out and lifts regularly, and we spend a lot of time doing active things together. We hike a lot, and do things like swimming, ice skating, rock climbing, and yoga together. He eats a lot of whole foods, and doesn't drink or smoke. Honestly, I feel like he's more ""in shape"" than I am, he just has a body type that retains fat."
1466,"My SO is chubby, and his weight doesn't bother me until it starts affecting his health (which is has, recently). I, on the other hand, am obsessed with losing weight (on myself) and getting fit.

I love him for him, and not gonna lie having a bit of chub is nice to cuddle."
1467,Im gay and I love women who are a little big. I love all women but since you‚Äôre asking about chubby significant others all I will say is... love it 10/10
1468,My friend is in excellent shape but it‚Äôs because she has an eating disorder she‚Äôs struggling with and winning against lately (yay). She is disgusted by her man getting chubbier and knows it‚Äôs coming from the eating disordered thoughts but doesn‚Äôt know what to do about it. She‚Äôs just having sex less often with him because she loves him and wouldn‚Äôt ever dream of pressuring him to lose weight like others pressured her. She‚Äôs basically going to focus on this in therapy and work through it hopefully. She‚Äôd never leave him because of it.
1469,"For me, being in shape matters because I love hiking and doing outdoor things. If my partner cant/doesnt wanna do those heavy activities  outside too it bothers me. 

I was dated someone that was kinda chubby and he didnt get why I loved working out, and would kinda get upset if I wanted to workout a lot- I think he was insecure about how fit I was compared to him. For me, self care if a very attractive quality. I would not date a chubby person again."
1470,"My metabolism works like a plow horse so at the age of 19 I‚Äôve never been over 105 lbs. It‚Äôs near impossible for me to gain weight and keep it on, and I don‚Äôt look unhealthy (at least in my and other‚Äôs opinions), especially because I‚Äôm pretty short so everything just kind of fills out. When my boyfriend and I started dating a little over a year ago, he joked that I would gain weight, as that tends to happen in new relationships. I told him that I‚Äôd welcome it with open arms and I hope that it happens, but that I could also promise him that it wouldn‚Äôt, and he laughed and said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see ;)‚Äù. About 8 months into our relationship he went to the doctor for a check up and was weighed at an almost 40 extra pounds than his last doctor‚Äôs visit, about a month or so before we‚Äôd became official. I‚Äôd noticed him gaining a bit of a belly but it never bothered me and it wasn‚Äôt until he pointed out the fact that he‚Äôd gained so much weight that I actually realized how noticeable it was. I‚Äôve always been more attracted to a fit man, as a lot of women are, but after 8 months of falling in love with my guy not only was it something I didn‚Äôt mind at all but it‚Äôs something I actually loved and still love about him. He deprecates himself on it a lot and I don‚Äôt think he believes me when I say I love his belly, but I really do. Given it‚Äôs not my usual preference I think the best way to describe why I like it is just because it‚Äôs him and I love him no matter what. Plus it also makes a great pillow :)"
1471,"I don't see my boyfriend as chubby but as thick. He is (I'm guessing on height, he told me his weight a few weeks ago) 5'7/5'9 and 240 pounds. I'm 5'4.5 and 115 pounds on a good day. I work out a lot when I can and my boyfriend is strong and muscular (doesn't workout but builds things and welds). It's nice honestly because he is a big strong cuddley teddy bear. I'm asexual panromantic, so I don't like sex and I love someone by their personality. He is just everything to me and as long as he continues to be healthy and the some person he is (unless he can become even better of a person some how) then that's all that matters to me."
1472,"I know personally, I workout quite a bit (like, I do a very intensive workout about 3-5 days a week most weeks) and get plenty of exercise outside of my workouts. I‚Äôve designed my routine for like.. what is, IMO, the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù shape for my body type. I also LOVE sweets etc but I eat very healthy and follow a ‚Äúlifestyle diet‚Äù or whatever. Point is, I‚Äôm in shape (like thin with curves). I‚Äôm a bit abnormal in that I‚Äôm way more attracted to thin-fit guys than like.. big muscle-y dudes. That being said tho, I like definition, and I appreciate effort... bc like... if I‚Äôm going to put as much effort into my appearance as I do, I kind of expect like.., at least a sliver of the same. My bf has been driving me CRAZY recently bc with all this isolation shit, obviously we‚Äôve been stuck inside and unable to go to the gym... but I‚Äôve still been doing my workout, and he‚Äôs just been sitting on the couchüòÖEven though he has naturally a good body type for a guy imo (thin, tall, kind of an upside-down triangle shape in his upper body lol), you can‚Äôt just rely on a high metabolism to give you a fit stomach or toned armsü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.. so it‚Äôs been pretty frustrating"
1473,"My husband is on the chunky side. I would say it endears me to him for the simple fact that his personality makes me love him. When we first met,  yes,  it was hard being attracted to him.  When we got married,  sex was a chore because in adition to being out of shape,  he has a bad back. Now,  we adapt. Do I think about what it would be like to have a smaller husband?  I do. Do I wish he would exercise with me?  More than anything in this world! But I just try my best not to dwell on it

He definely makes me feel protected"
1474,"I've got the thin muscle thing going on. I guess I'm lucky. My SO really doesn't. He's about 20 lbs overweight, and I really don't care. What we have is more than physical, and his weight isn't such an issue that it matters physically anyway."
1475,"I don't work my ass off or anything, in fact there are long periods of time where I don't work out but it really does not make that much of a difference from when I do go to the gym. 

I mostly watch what I eat and eat in small portions. I'm very disciplined when it comes to food. Not that I eat super healthy stuff only, but I mean: no overeating,  no unhealthy snacks and no soda. I allow myself sugary (iced) coffees and a little bit of chocolate with my night time tea. Staying in shape is really important to me. Being with someone who is notably overweight with probably different eating habits could be a problem in that I might pick up on his eating habits and in turn get fat (surprise: one of my biggest fears)
And I'll be honest, I'm not attracted to bigger guys at all. Not even slightly chubby ones. It's probably shallow of me but it's how I feel. Hope it will change later down the line because it's probably a terrible idea to reject an amazing person based on their weight."
1476,"My bf was underweight when we first got together, now he has a ""dad bod"". In terms of looks I don't care one way or the other, but he's unhappy with the way he looks and feels and I want him to get to a level of fitness where he feels good about himself. My only personal concern is that he be able to keep up with me on hikes."
1477,"It wouldn‚Äôt happen. I like lean men. I don‚Äôt care if he has zero muscle/noodle arms as long as he‚Äôs lean. I‚Äôve noticed that lean men have more well-defined face due to less fat being stored in their cheeks. Chubbier guys tend to have softer, rounded faces."
1478,I hate that his boobs are bigger than mine.
1479,I don‚Äôt.
1480,Never dated one. Will never date one.
1481,"Wouldn't say excellent, but I guess it depends on how chubby. I like guys who don't have abs and loads of muscle still, they're very comfortable and give great hugs
But if they are at a point where they look unhealthy then I'm not too happy."
1482,"I work out a lot and focus hard on eating healthy and staying in a fit weight. Before I only used to date fit guys. I don't know what happened, but about 2 years ago I started to date bigger guys. They are SO hot and many are amazing in bed! I've got a BF now and he is about 60 lbs above the ideal weight, but he is SO hot!! I love him and he is so sexy! And I like that I'm tiny next to him. I know he had some insecurity issues when we first got together. He said how would somebody like me be with somebody like him, but we quickly worked through that, and now I believe that he understands how sexy I find him. The only thing I would worry about is if he is going to live a long life and health issues and such, I don't want anything to happen to him, but at the end of the day his health is his choice."
1483,I like sexy bear type. He's fun to cook for and I am very attracted to him.
1484,"I‚Äôm not currently, but before my fianc√© I had only been in relationships like this. And to be quite honest I even had myself convinced that I loved and even preferred it that way, but I would be lying if I said being with somebody fit now is not just... a whole different experience. I like having a dude I can look at and drool over, would never go back.

That being said I‚Äôd definitely prefer a dude who was fat to one who was way too thin."
1485,"I don't feel ""blessed"" with a fit body. I was naturally skinny-ish most of my life, then depression hit me like a brick wall and now I'm stuck with certain eating habits that keep me at a 48kg weigh.

So if I meet a guy that can get me to eat more and put on some weight, sure, cool.

Also, I feel attracted to chubby men anyway. I think the flab is cute. And it's extra sexy if the guy is comfortable being chubby. Being in a relationship or having sex with someone that's truly comfortable in their skin is great.

As far as I'm concerned, if the guy isn't obese, has good hygiene and a sense of humor, then I'm up for it."
1486,"Well I wouldn't say excellent shape, but I'm quite thin and I'm fairly active. My boyfriend is about twice my weight (he carries it quite well though), and I don't mind at all. I've always preferred dad bods anyway so it's more of a plus. However we both spend lots of time outside and enjoy hiking and exploring, so it's not like his weight is stopping him from doing anything like that. I think that as long as he feels good, I'll be happy as well"
1487,"I divorced my ex partly because of it. 

When we were dating/engaged and newlywed, health and fitness were important to him. He lost a lot of weight (290 down to 215) it was a big deal to me because it helped me feel comfortable with a 15 year age gap. He stopped being mindful of his mental and physical health. He gained it back and for the next five years he never got serious about it again. 

Of course there were other reasons, there wasn't a solid partnership there and many other things but that was a big deal."
1488,"I personally am not really attracted to the super muscular and cut type of guy. It‚Äôs just not my preference. If I had up design my ideal guy, he would be strong and muscular but with some chub on the outside üòÅ"
1489,"I dated a guy who went from fit/""normal"" to gaining 80-100 lbs (not sure how much because we didn't own a scale- I was not ""allowed"" to get one for my own use even because it upset him). It didn't bother me until he was unable to keep up on the most basic physical things, and let his hygiene slip. Now I have a very low ""has to do basic taking care of himself things"" bar set for future relationships."
1490,"My boyfriend is a bit on the chubby side, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me as I thought it might. He was in better shape before I met him, but since starting uni the infamous freshman fifteen have made their appearance. I like that he‚Äôs warm and soft, his cuddles are the best! The only time I even think about it is when other people comment on it or he refuses to eat something due to the amount of calories it contains. Loving our bodies the way they are is difficult enough, but I‚Äôve found boys struggle too. Let‚Äôs just hope this whole isolation business motivates us to get healthy at any size :))



P.S. If you‚Äôre reading this, I love youuuu"
1491,"I‚Äôve always loved bigger guys. Super defined muscles and abs and stuff never attracted me although sometimes they‚Äôre fun to look at. My current partner is 250 pounds of love and happiness, and he is absolutely gorgeous in every way. I always make sure he knows he‚Äôs handsome and I love his body. However, he is on his way to losing weight (he‚Äôs lost 15 pounds so far!!!) and I‚Äôm encouraging him because it makes him happy. We‚Äôve both agreed he looks better with some weight on him so he‚Äôs been losing weight and we are going to work out together so he can fill himself out with a bit of muscle. 

As long as he‚Äôs happy, I‚Äôm happy at the end of the day. 

I get lots of looks and comments though. He wears the weight well and to me, he looks like a normal guy, just a bit larger on the sides. But for so many people, they view him as some kind of gross animal and have insulted him and me for dating him. I‚Äôve been especially insulted by other men who think that I‚Äôm just dating him to prove a point. If I was trying to prove one, you‚Äôd think after 8 years I would‚Äôve done it already."
1492,"I'm in normal BMI range and I exercise 4-6 times a week (running mostly).

Honestly I can't do chubby. Thin is good, Normal is good, ripped is good. Obese or obviously overweight (smaller than most think) is out. When I was younger I had a partner who gained a lot of weight and I just didn't find it attractive at all.

Currently with a marathon runner so all is good between us attraction wise."
1493,"My situation is the complete opposite! I‚Äôm in incredible shape but still have a chubby yet curvy body type with an excellent diet and I take really good care of myself, but my husband is an awful eater, pretty skinny, smoker and can‚Äôt run for like 10 seconds. But we‚Äôre super happy!:)"
1494,"I'm active, eat healthy, and maintain my calories. My husband doesn't. He goes on walks with me and tries to eat healthy but that's about it.

I wish he'd take more of an effort to lose some weight, and he will for about a day or two, but then he reverts back to his bad eating habits when he can no longer stand eating healthy. 

I'm content with him BUT if he were to gain any more weight, I'd have to have a serious convo with him. I love him with all my heart! But eating healthy (for the most part) and staying active are big parts of my life."
1495,"I‚Äôve been into weightlifting for going on 8 years now, I compete in obstacle course racing, and I also do long distance trail running. I wouldn‚Äôt date someone who doesn‚Äôt at least do some type of consistent exercising. For me, fitness is such a huge part of my life (I also work in the industry) so it comes down to lifestyle. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt run up mountains like I do, but we go lifting together so we can both enjoy exercising together. If we drive somewhere, we‚Äôll park farther away from the entrance so we can walk a little more. We‚Äôll take the stairs instead of the elevator. When we go to the beach, we‚Äôd rather take a long walk along the shore than lay down in the sun. I‚Äôve briefly dated an obese guy before and he was so boring because he didn‚Äôt want to do anything that involved moving. That involved sex too (it was trash). I wouldn‚Äôt do that again. There‚Äôs definitely a physical attraction thing when it comes to fit guys too, no doubt. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm a goddess myself, but for someone who has spent many years of hard work and discipline sculpting their body, I don‚Äôt think that I should have to settle for someone who runs out breath climbing a flight of stairs."
1496,"I‚Äôm a bit of a fitness freak, I lost a lot of weight after i started dating my SO 5 years ago because I got into running and weightlifting every day. 
My partner on the other hand gained weight over the time we‚Äôve been together, but I don‚Äôt really care. At most it‚Äôs like 20 lbs and he‚Äôs a really tall guy so it‚Äôs not much of a problem. 
Sometimes I wish he was  a little fitter because it would make our sex life better, but I already love our sex so I don‚Äôt mind, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a dealbreaker. Plus he is my best friend and my favourite person, and as his best friend I just want him to be happy! Sometimes he tries running or lifting with me but it‚Äôs not his thing. He‚Äôs a musician so he spends the time I spend exercising writing music and practicing. It‚Äôs just our hobbies  are different and that‚Äôs ok. I still find him sexy the way he is. I think his belly is cute and he‚Äôs so nice to cuddle with. 

However, if he were to suddenly start gaining weight In a way that affected his health or happiness I‚Äôm totally prepared to talk to him and help him out if he wants. But I‚Äôm talking about enough weight that he could be considered overweight or affecting his health, a little holiday weight isn‚Äôt a problem. I go up and down too."
1497,"I was married to a very lean (not fit) guy. I was with him for 14 years. I left the marriage 2 years ago and experienced dating. I‚Äôm a personal trainer and fitness/yoga instructor so I‚Äôd say my fitness level is good. I dated a variety of body types and a chubby guy restored my faith in men. We didn‚Äôt continue dating due to differing levels of commitment, nothing to do with body type. I have had several men tell me they don‚Äôt workout much and that I intimidate them due to my level of fitness, so that has been interesting to navigate as I don‚Äôt brag about my workouts or fitness level - I had 1 gym pic of me lifting weights and one of me teaching a cycle class on my dating profile, along with pics of me drinking beer and pics of me cuddling my cats. I have learned that I‚Äôm not physically attracted to obese men, but bring on some chub if you got it!"
1498,"I'm blessed with a fast metabolism, so I'm generally slim, unless I down like a whole pizza, then I've got a food baby. When I am in a relationship with someone ideally I'd like them to put the same effort into their looks as they have been before meeting me. I understand some people get comfortable and start becoming a bit lenient on their routine to enjoy the relationship or fit in that dinner date at where ever. But I like to make sure I'm looking good just as I was when we first met, or at least trying to maintain my figure and expect them to try to do so aswell."
1499,"I'm naturally slender, with a lot of active hobbies and a plant based diet. I've been in great shape and I've been in less than top condition. Whatever shape I'm in, I will prefer an overweight partner over one who isn't. Maybe fifty pounds overweight, and active and adventurous, is ideal."
1500,"I'm fine with being fit as long as it's not powerlifter fit, that always seems over the top to me, and I'm fine with dad bod chubby as long as he makes an effort to also stay healthy and not cross into obese territory."
1501,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 140 pounds of mostly muscle and a little bit of fat. I was a dancer for 16 years, and my whole life I‚Äôve had a very fast metabolism so I haven‚Äôt had to worry about what I‚Äôm eating. It‚Äôs led to some unhealthy eating habits that I‚Äôm doing my best to change. 
My boyfriend is 6‚Äô2 and like 270 pounds. He played football in high school, but he was an offensive lineman so all he knew was ‚Äúgains.‚Äù He‚Äôs also gained some weight since then. 
What attracted me to him was his humor and outgoing personality. We were friends for a year before dating, and in that time he showed me how caring and respectful he is. I fell in love with every part of him, regardless of how much he weighs. 
He told me early on that he‚Äôs always hated taking his shirt off in front of people, and has been self conscious about his size. After he made a few similar comments, I asked if he‚Äôd want to join the gym. I told him ‚ÄúI love you and every part of you, but I feel like you don‚Äôt. I want you to look in the mirror and like what you see.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt my intent to make him skinnier, I just wanted him to be happier. 
It took several months for him to warm up to it, but in the end it was his prompting that got us to join. Now we go 4-5 times a week, and it‚Äôs our favorite time to spend together. He‚Äôs gone down three belt loops, and he‚Äôs so much more confident!! He‚Äôs on his feet at work, and he used to come home exhausted every day. Now he has so much more energy. He‚Äôs still a really big guy, but his mindset completely changed:)"
1502,"If I‚Äôm being completely honest, I would resent it. I‚Äôm not attracted to overweight men. I dated a guy for two years who looked like he was in decent shape, slim but had broad shoulders and chest. Never worked out and it bugged me. It‚Äôs a high value of mine. So not only is it important that my mate be in good shape and good health, I want him to value it as highly as I do and actually work for and prioritize it."
1503,"I dated a man who was overweight. It wasn't an issue because he didn't resent the time I spent working out, and he was active himself (he just ate a lot and drank a little too much). So I would run or mountain bike on my own or with friends during the week, then on the weekend we would go hiking, backpacking, snowshoeing, rock climbing, whatever together. Our sex life was probably the best I've had. I wouldn't say I'm specifically attracted to chubby people. I was attracted to him, he happened to be chubby.

I don't think I could date someone who was inactive - but that's because of the lifestyle clash rather than the weight."
1504,"I don't find overweight or out of shape men attractive. I've been with overweight and out of shape men in the past, and frankly, they sexually can't keep up. 


Maybe there are exceptions, like with everything, but when you don't have a lot of endurance and a bad heart from being out of shape ... lots of limp noodles, lazy starfishing, and weak erections if they can get one. I don't like the feeling of big bellies, I've found out. It's extremely unpleasant to be under someone who's huffing and puffing up a storm giving weak thrusts and drenching you in sweat. And while I don't mind being on top, doing that *every single time we get intimate* will take me out of the mood. 


Sexual compatibility is important in relationships to me and from what I've experienced with chubby guys, they aren't my cup of tea."
1505,"I'm in shape, and I want to be with someone else who is. I want my partner to be able to go for a jog with me, go on a weekend hiking trip, go to the gym, and if they're overweight, chances are that's not going to happen. I'd feel the same if they weren't overweight, but were skinny fat. It's just not what I'm into. I want someone at the same fitness level as me so they can do the things I enjoy with me, and actually enjoy doing them too."
1506,"I'm pretty fit, and on a purely physical level, I'm just not attracted to overweight men. Could one win me over with his great personality? Possibly, but I'm a very physical person, so it would be hard for me to be with someone I wasn't sexually attracted to. I've had the talk with myself that maybe I'm shallow, and maybe I am, but we all have preferences."
1507,"Honestly, it's less about how someone looks and more about if they can keep up with me. I have an active lifestyle and I want to share it with someone."
1508,"I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm in ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù shape, but I have an athletic build and I‚Äôm normal weight. I work out a lot and focus on my body a lot. I‚Äôm not super fit but I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm in shape, mostly healthy at least. My boyfriend is overweight. Honestly I like him that way, it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. I don‚Äôt wanna say I have a fetish necessarily, but I‚Äôve found myself to be happier with him than I was with the fit men that I was with in the past. And while most of it has to do just with loving him, I‚Äôd still say objectively that I prefer him being heavier. The sex is better because of the force lmao. It feels like you‚Äôre getting fucked a lot harder tbh. And as far as looking at him during sex, I mean, that‚Äôs my man. I love his body, whether he‚Äôs heavy or not. He‚Äôll always be overwhelmingly attractive to me regardless. I get off to him easily just by looking at him, and I think his chunky body is sexy. I will say that occasionally I do worry he will take it too far. Basically I‚Äôm fine with his weight right now but I hope it won‚Äôt be on an incline, because while it doesn‚Äôt matter to me cosmetically, I do worry for his health sometimes."
1509,[removed]
1510,My boyfriend started putting on weight but I don't even mind because I love him anyway. The only thing that makes me anxious is the fact that it might not stop here if he doesn't do anything. So there's that.
1511,"I work out almost every day. I do 10-20 minutes a day workout on an app on my phone in addition to my commute which involves cycling and running some stairs and power walking 15 minutes to and from my office. While I don't hit the gym this has served me well.

I'm not attracted to chubbier guys- I think it's because I percieve them as having sedendary lifestyle and that to me is an indicator of laziness which means I might have to pick up the slack with a lot of things. People who are active and move more have more blood flowing into their brain, which means they respond to things faster than sedentary people do. 

This is just me making things up but this is my perception. The other reason I refuse to couple up with someone chubby is because men already usually pass away before their female counterparts. I know we can't determine all health indicators but I really don't want to date and ultimately end up with someone who doesn't take care of their health. 

Why? Because I don't want to be 60 about to retire (maybe already retired) and married to someone who is already convalescing and who I need to play nurse with. It is super, super important to me for a man to take care of himself physically and mentally- and know what he needs to do to stay healthy. If a guy gets sick and does his best to be healthy in life then whatever I'll stick it through cause there are things totally beyond our control of course but if I guy is going downhill at a young age because he eats like shit and won't get it together I'm definitely not hitching my trailer to that."

1513,"I am! I do yoga/pilates/zumba almost every day. I used to be a dancer, so I've always had a long lean build. My husband is a little chubby here and there, but tall and strong and has an amazing shape for his frame. I am really attracted to men who are tall and bigger. Not overweight or unhealthy, but bulky. There is something so sexy about a strong dude who is also soft and gentle. ü§§"
1514,"my bf is chubby and im completely fine with that. in fact, i love is body, and i love how honest and human our relationship with each other's bodies is"
1515,I want them healthy and not overly muscular (like where the muscles are bulging out  and stuff when they aren't even flexing) but healthy means smth different for each body. so like just stay active is my take.
1516,My SO is fitter than me and I got active because of him. I can't imagine otherwise. I need someone who inspire me to be better.
1517,"I'm not attracted to chubby people per se, but I'm attracted to my SO because he's got a lot of other attractive physical qualities. Nice hair, nice legs, nice voice, pretty eyes. I'd rather have chubby over bony or buttless. 

That said, there's a limit and we're at the age where the lifestyle and health differences can be a real issue. Also, it's kind of demotivating to be around a couch potato."
1518,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 103lbs. I like to walk and hike but nothing too strenuous. I‚Äôm not in excellent shape but I‚Äôm very thin and take good care to watch my diet. My husband is 6‚Äô0‚Äù and about 175/180. He‚Äôs Asian and carries his weight directly in his abdomen. He has an amazing sense of humor. I wouldn‚Äôt trade him for anyone. He is the sexiest person in the world to me. Looks are always going to change as you get older but a great personality will likely stick around a lot longer.
1519,"I‚Äôm not ‚Äúfit‚Äù in the sense that I exercise, but I eat healthy and work on my feet all day. People have assumed that I work out, so I guess I got lucky - though judging by my mother and what she looked like pre-kids, I can kiss this body goodbye if I ever pop any out. I weigh about 115lbs at 5‚Äô3‚Äù

My boyfriend weighs ~285 at 6‚Äô2‚Äù. He is a Big Boi and he eats a lot of crap food and has a belly, which I find endearing and actually very masculine. He‚Äôs not like a blob person, or anything. He‚Äôs very strong and has a big frame, so he carries it well. I like big guys in general - I‚Äôm not specifically attracted to chubby men, but I like tall guys and I‚Äôll take a tall guy with extra pounds over a tall skinny guy.

It doesn‚Äôt affect our sex life. He has way more stamina than me because I get muscle fatigue really easily and I have shitty joints (rheumatoid arthritis). Never had any issues with his stomach getting in the way, except for trying to have sex in a ‚Äúspooning‚Äù position. That doesn‚Äôt really work for us."
1520,"Only one of my exes were fit but he wasn't comfortable cuddling with them. Most of the guys I dated are on the lean/slender type.  I don't mind the dad bod too much if their personality is great and they are very conscious about their food.  My s/o is the best damn guy I've ever been with and we have a lot in common in other aspects of our life. He likes to be active, but he's not a gym enthusiast.  As long as they are aware that diabetes can happen to anyone and takes the preventable actions so we can live a long life then I'm goood."
1521,"I take pride in eating healthy and organic. I workout when I can but for me it‚Äôs a nutrition thing more so than being ripped. I‚Äôm currently dating someone that was extremely muscular and fit when we started dating but gained more than a few pounds of the course of the year we have been together.It doesn‚Äôt really bother me. In my eyes he‚Äôs still the man I fell in love with. I still want to kiss all over him and be wrapped up in his arms. I care about his health and want him to live longer and therefore be healthier but it‚Äôs not the weight that is an issue for me. 

But the one thing that really bothers me the most is other people‚Äôs opinions. We work together and sometimes I get hit on or I‚Äôll talk about my boyfriend and they will want to know more so I‚Äôll point him out. And the reactions from other people are disgusting. To the point I have told people off. One lady said she had no idea how he got me because I‚Äôm so beautiful and well.. ‚Äúlook at you‚Äù. She said that to his face while she was drinking. She was a regular. Next time I saw her I told her to never speak to my boyfriend like that ever again. Another customer after I told him who my Boyfriend that I constantly gush over was said something along the lines of.. ew! The fat one? 

People are so fucking cruel. If I love my man I love him for who he is. I could really care less bc I love his soul and mind but it‚Äôs the comments and looks from other people that weigh on me the most. Just because I‚Äôm ‚Äúout of his league‚Äù does not give people the right to be so judgement."
1522,"I don‚Äôt necessarily mind having extra weight, but there has to be some effort. I don‚Äôt need super muscly body builder type, but a lot of effort goes into my body, so I expect some effort on their part. My ex was very skinny and had no muscle. He literally didn‚Äôt exercise at all, yet because at the time I was heavier than he was I got made to feel bad about it. Didn‚Äôt matter that I was stronger, fitter, healthier than him, I had some extra weight on and he hated it. Once we broke up, the weight just melted off. I now look for guys who have a sport as a hobby. It can be any sport or just going to the gym in general. I‚Äôm not attracted to guys with no muscle tone anymore"
1523,I like a chunky guy! They‚Äôre great lovers honestly ü•∞
1524,I don‚Äôt have a ‚Äútype‚Äù and actually like some cushion. My husband is in shape but I would not mind if he gained some weight. For me it‚Äôs not about his body so much as I want a partner who is active with me... but I‚Äôm attracted to various body types
1525,"I accepted if did a while, then I was done with his excuses. But he‚Äôs obese"
1526,"I would say I‚Äôm getting fit again! I‚Äôve always been either super fit or chunky. Currently dechunking right now and already down 15 lbs. I wouldn‚Äôt call my boyfriend chunky. I like big teddy bear guys. To me nothing is worse then lying my head down and he‚Äôs not warm and squishy. 

Everyone has a different ideal body type they are attracted too. I prefer big guys but not super tall that I can‚Äôt see his face when I‚Äôm talking to him. 

We‚Äôre both happy with each other bodies, so I think that‚Äôs what matters most. 

Getting back in shape is for me, not him. When I had a 6 pack that was for me and not him too. 

I‚Äôm more concerned about his overall health and getting him to quit those damn cigarettes!

I also like a partner who likes food! I want someone who wants to cook and enjoy a beer! He‚Äôs also the nicest man ever! You can change your weight but not your personality!"
1527,"I‚Äôve had an ex who, while we were dating went from gym bod to slightly curvy dad bod.  It genuinely didn‚Äôt bother me, but it bothered him a lot.

For me personally I‚Äôm fine with a little curve.  I‚Äôll actually take curvy over super skinny, personally, for both men and women."
1528,"My partner is muscley but he‚Äôs got a bit of a stomach. so long as he is healthy, i‚Äôm happy! plus the chub makes him like a big teddy bear for cuddles, i love it. 

but as a note: attraction is very objective. you could be fit and stereotypically attractive and there will still be people who aren‚Äôt into you. just be yourself and make sure YOU‚ÄôRE happy with the way that you look and who you are as a person. that‚Äôs the most important thing."
1529,"1- I love my man as is üòä. He works a very physically demanding job so he‚Äôs built but has a belly (he likes his beer)

2- zero resentment, but when I met him he was like this.  He‚Äôs actually lost a bit since we got together 

3- I don‚Äôt mind one bit.  I was attracted to him the way he is right now, belly and all

4- I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm attracted to chubby people soecifically, but it‚Äôs also not a deal breaker 

5- zero effect on our sex life üòÅ

Im super fit for a 43 year old mother of one.  I used to look for men that could keep up with me.  Realized I‚Äôm a bit of an anomaly.  My friends even told me to stop looking for someone that could keep up with me -I‚Äôm beyond what most people can achieve fitness-wise at my age.  I realized that and lowered my expectations and voila, met the man of my dreams."
1530,One day I'm gonna learn how to flirt in real life and it's apparently going to work out quite well for me.
1531,I love it! Love love love it!
1532,"It‚Äôs literally never occurred to me to write someone off because of their shape or size. I‚Äôve dated beautiful men, not so beautiful men, short men, tall men, chubby dudes, ripped dudes. Almost all of them have had long hair and big noses though. That‚Äôs my line in the sand for some unknowable reason üòÇ"
1533,I didn't like it...I just was not physically attracted after a while :)
1534,[removed]
1535,"I do a lot to stay healthy. I find that I typically date huskier men. I think it just sorta happened that way because I'm attracted to guys that are much more relaxed than I am.  

Also, I just find chub to be hot. Chubby Pratt> six pack Pratt"
1536,"I consider myself fit & physically attractive, and I, my friend, am most certainly what one would call a ‚Äúchubby chaser‚Äù.  If my SO gets too cut I‚Äôll stuff his damn face till I get a little squish back. To each his own, I think. :)"
1537,"I don‚Äôt dislike a chubby body at all, from a hookup perspective. But I want someone to spend my life with. So I DO expect a significant other to be in shape, stay in shape, and maintain a generally healthy state.

For the same reason I wouldn‚Äôt commit to someone who smokes heavily- I don‚Äôt want to choose to spend my life with someone with the unspoken understanding they‚Äôll likely die earlier than I will. I don‚Äôt want to have to go hiking by myself; I don‚Äôt want our future kids to be shorted. I want to be with someone who makes choices with our mutual best interests at heart."
1538,"I will admit since getting fitter and healthier I'm much less attracted to chubby guys, and just less tolerant of other lifestyle choices like drinking/smoking weed to excess, laziness, playing videogames all day etc.

Anecdotally I've found sex to be much much better with in-shape dudes..."
1539,My rule is as long as they can hold up their own weight during sex its all good
1540,"I love my partner (of course) even though they aren‚Äôt fit. Of course my partner has his own goals for how he wants to look an feel.

To be honest I find being with someone who isn‚Äôt very fit to be much more comfortable. I don‚Äôt feel pressured to work out or look a certain way and I don‚Äôt have those expectations for my partner either."
1541,"I think I agree with many of the comments here about valuing other things a lot more, however I also think the amount of extra weight also plays a role. I think generally being a healthy weight can give insight into other areas of someone life like accountability and laziness and those things are much more important than physical appearances."
1542,I naturally have a good body but do work out a couple times a week as I‚Äôve found active hobbies that I love. I have a strong preference for a chubby/big guy as long as he‚Äôs staying healthy and not doing things to shorten his lifespan. I love  cuddling with someone soft.
1543,"I don't usually care, but if they talk about weight and stuff I don't know what to say because I fear I will hurt them somehow. This also happens when someone complains about their weight, I try to cheer them up and they say ""you are like this because you are skinny, you can't understand it"". I don't know how to react at all so I just go awkward."
1544,"I don‚Äôt workout for hours every day, i‚Äôm sort of just naturally small. Our relationship didn‚Äôt happen on purpose, we were friends and just kind of fell in love one day. His extra weight was due to a medication and stress growing up and he stays healthy with me eating wise. He is the best person I have ever been with and treats me better than anyone. I guess I am so grateful for the person he is that I don‚Äôt even think about his weight really."
1545,"I‚Äôve only dated men with a little extra. The only time I don‚Äôt like it is when they complain about their weight, but do nothing to fix it."
1546,"I'm not athletic in any way, just extremely thin. I'm a recovering anorexic slowly working my way to push ups so I can eventually start lifting! My boyfriend is very chubby, and soft everywhere. I love it. A lot of my friends refer to me as a chubby chaser, but I wouldn't define myself like that. I didn't say yes to my boyfriend because he's fat (nor would I say no), but I started loving it because it's him. As long as he remains relatively healthy and doesn't inhibit his own quality of life, I'm more than okay with him!

As far as our sex life goes, it's not much different than with a thin guy. The biggest thing is that a lot of websites will recommend your man penetrates you from behind while you lay down, and this is not possible with a bigger guy. We both learned that in the moment, haha. In missionary his belly crushes me a little bit, but I like the feeling of his weight coming down on me. I'm into breathplay though. Riding is exceptionally good though! I blame my boyfriends belly for how many orgasms I have... Every time you come down you can grind on it for some extra stimulation, and I now have a more fulfilling sex life than I have with any other guy. Date a chubby guy! Don't turn down a dude for his weight, and see what he has to offer in personality. (or if you're like any sane person, their body will become sexy because you love them) :-)

As far as how I feel, I feel like I was blessed with the best hunk of 200 pounds that I could've possibly gotten. He's a dog person, and loves my big dog! He's nerdy and loves comics (but my collection is bigger. He won't tell you that!) And he's funny and charming in everything he does. Never settle ladies."
1547,"I was in excellent shape when I was dating my ex who was pretty overweight, but he was 6'10 and carried it well in my opinion. I've always liked big, burly guys, and I found him very attractive physically. Cuddling with him felt amazing too, he was like a giant teddy bear lol. In general I tend to be more attracted to men with muscles, but I'd definitely date someone with a body like my ex's again.

ETA: Always preferred curvier women. As much as I obsess over my own weight, when it comes to *other* girls, chubby is what I find most attractive."
1548,"I‚Äôm in reasonably good shape and have always been naturally thin, I don‚Äôt care that my husband is overweight and he always has been. BUT it is driving me nuts that in isolation he‚Äôs not getting his body moving at all. He won‚Äôt go for walks or do anything at home. At least before he‚Äôd get some exercise just from being out in the world. I worry about his health in that regard."
1549,"I weightlift hard approximately 10-14 hours a week 1 1/2-2 hours a day. I work my ass off (especially since I can't do much running because of a minor hip issue) and it payed off I have a full six pack with less than 17% fat content. Honestly if I was attracted to him, he made me laugh, and feel good I wouldn't mind, but at the same time because I spend so much time in fitness I would want whoever I date to do it with me and have as much fun as I do, that and over the years most chubby guys I've known are very insecure about their weight and I'm not good with helping people through self depreciating problems involving bodily image. (I know thats weirdly specific but friends have put alot of pressure on me in the past and I just can't handle it anymore.)"
1550,"I‚Äôm sure it depends person to person but honestly it would bother me. Being active is important to me and I‚Äôve tried dating guys before on the fluffy side and I found myself getting out of shape being with them as well as bored cause they weren‚Äôt into active hobbies. Also it might make me seem shallow but I would lose attraction to those chubby boyfriends, you can‚Äôt control who you are attracted to. I‚Äôve had friends who prefer dad bods so just depends on the person."
1551,"My poor husband I think is naturally thick. He got a booty that I would love to have (minus the hair). He weighs over 60 pounds more than me but is the same height. He loves cycling thankfully a healthy habit, but he also loves ice cream/bread/cheese(who doesn‚Äôt). For our wedding I got him going to the gym with me and eating better, he lost a whole suit size and I was so happy he did that for me. He looked more like when I met him (he was 20 pounds lighter then). 

He‚Äôs gained back the weight since then (over a year ago) doesn‚Äôt go to the gym,still tries to eat a little better but it‚Äôs hard. I love all that food too, and I eat it all the time with him. It‚Äôs frustrating because I work out to be able to eat that food and he doesn‚Äôt any more. I tell him I just want him healthy. He carries it all in the middle and I know it‚Äôs around his organs.  He hasn‚Äôt gained any more weight, just back to pre wedding weight, but he‚Äôs still bigger than when I met him. Lucky for him I love him anyway."
1552,"My partner has what could be regarded as a 'husky' body shape (big chest and skinny waist like an upside down triangle) and I love it.  He was overweight earlier on in life, learned a few lessons, and takes excellent care of himself now.  I know that he's self-conscious sometimes but I love his body and tell him that, often."
1553,"My SO has gained weight since we got together. I am definitely less attracted to his body, but I understand what led him there. He is losing weight again slowly, so that's great."
1554,"I have been with extremely fit men and chubby men in my life ( I've always been in shape) Their personally will make them handsome or ugly for me. It's all in the way they speak and treat people.   ü§ó  I've had a guy with a weight issue make me feel like I was on top of the world and fit men push me into depression.  
My SO now... Weight isn't a factor for anything. I don't see it."
1555,"I was different types of overweight for most of my life and in the last three years I've been the leanest since I was a child. I'm 33 now. My boyfriend is chubby and at first I didn't really find him attractive, but over time I realized I find his body very attractive. It doesn't feel like something I have to put up with or anything. I think the love and attraction feed each other there.

The funny thing is that now I look more fit and conventionally attractive than him, but I'm in worse shape. He has very muscular legs and he's very strong. I'm thin, but I have very little muscle and stamina. I don't think being chubby means being out of shape."
1556,Ive dated a man that was chunkier and I didnt mind. I'm attracted to a cute face and a great personality. I'm currently trying to give my boyfriend a dad bod haha.
1557,"I would never date a man who‚Äôs overweight or does not look after himself. I work hard to exercise and look good, he better do the same as well"
1558,[removed]
1559,"Oh god I was having some self confidence back and then I read this thread.

Anyway wlw relationship here. Was in fucking great shape (army shape) but had some personal issues that made me gain weight at the same time I met my now SO who has a body that every girl dream of having, without even working out even if she did before we got together.

She always told me she fell in love with the person I am mentally not physically. And that I got fat wasn't an issue, and that she will support whatever choice I make (to stay like this or get back in shape) as long as I'm not in danger for my health both mental or physical.

But now that I read all those replies here I'm starting to wonder if she is telling the truth. It's like people just assume their SO got fat because they let themself go. Have you heard of depression? Sometimes will alone is not enough to go lift some weight. You have to go under therapy and/or medication to have a will to do something else than go to work, eat, sleep. 

(And no, I didn't gain my weight from depression, but know a lot of people who did and are feeling even more shitty because people just think they are lazy or whatever for letting themself go down like this. This is infuriating. Just because you succeeded at something doesn't mean everyone is as strong as you or function mentally like you.)"
1560,"I'm generally more attracted to skinny and fit guys, my main thing is I would like them to join me on activities. I have a really good friend with an obese SO and it seems like a reoccurring issue for her, from walking the dogs alone/not having someone to go on hikes with, to SO being unhealthy and worrying her because of that. We also, when younger, used to have very similar lifestyles and while I'm not surprised that's changed I think it wouldn't have changed as much if it weren't for this person. It's hard to look your friend in the eyes when she's trying to not cry because she wanted to share this beautiful nature experience with her favorite person and they couldn't go more than fifty feet in on what is ultimately a very easy short trek. 

I guess I'm just saying what everyone else is saying, it's not that much of an issue until the lifestyles conflict too much and/or health is in danger. Either the relationship will have to end, or one will have to change their lifestyle."
1561,"Both my partner and I are very into fitness and just overall living a healthy lifestyle. This is the first time I have been with someone like this and it honestly makes worlds of a difference for me. It‚Äôs not necessarily the looks (although I do enjoy that) it‚Äôs the fact that he‚Äôs driven in very similar ways that I am. My last partner was super lazy, overweight, didn‚Äôt care about his eating habits and a big stoner. It wasn‚Äôt in line with who I wanted to be and even though he wasn‚Äôt a bad person, he wasn‚Äôt the person for me. I need someone who is more in line with who I want to be so we can grow together"
1562,[removed]
1563,Chubby men look weak and womanly
1564,"Dont care. I love him for far, far more than that. Would never even cross my mind."
1565,"I love every part of him and am so attracted to him. I worry with this virus that even the fittest people are in icu‚Äôs or worse have passed away, and I don‚Äôt want anything to happen to him.. I want to spend my life with him and no one else."
1566,"My boyfriend isn't that chubby, but he's cute to me. I didn't think he was that attractive until I started dating him. He gets hotter every day."
1567,"My boyfriend isnt the most build guy in the gym by far, but I'm attracted to him nonetheless. I think he is very handsome despite and even because of his weight. It doesnt impact our sex life at all, and we have great sex together. I have also known him for 15 years prior as friends, and I love him and his family before we started dating. I love his tummy but I also encourage him on his weight loss journey too. I think he is very sexy overall."
1568,"I'm not ""fit"" because I despise working out, but I'm blessed with great genes and so far (I'm in my mid thirties) I've never had to diet to maintain a healthy weight. My husband is very overweight, has been since we met. I don't mind at all, I fell for him because he is a very enigmatic person and a great husband and father. He does want to lose weight and I'm very supportive of that, but I'm not going to push him because I feel it needs to come from him and not from me."
1569,I‚Äôm a very active flow rain but I actually really like the ‚Äúdad bod‚Äù look. Not grossly overweight but I like a thicker guy
1570,"I'm not doing so hot now, but before coronavirus I was in pretty good shape from dance classes.  I met a partner who is overweight and working on it, and he's also really tall.  I like how I can bury myself into him and he can hug my whole body.  And I also like climbing all over him on the bed and riding him when we have sex.  His size makes it more fun.  His lower stomach rubs my clitoris when I'm grinding on him and causes me to orgasm a lot during sex which hardly ever happened with past partners.  I also like how he isn't vain because most guys who are in shape constantly send photos of themselves or talk about their own bodies a lot and it's exhausting.  I like attention on me and he gives me that.  He's my favorite person.  <3 . My gigantic bear man."
1571,"I‚Äôm a petite woman, and naturally have always had a small and fit frame. Did competitive sports for 15+ years and then after that ended, I kept up my figure by getting into meal prepping/fasting/eating healthy as well as staying active. I do consider the fact that I am naturally small so I guess I am lucky in that aspect, but I do work hard to maintain it.
My long term boyfriend, however, has gained about 50-70 lbs. since the beginning of our relationship. When we met, we were both fit, and now he is very overweight. I love him dearly, but I would be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt affect the way I look at him and the future of our relationship. I love him, but it has made me less attracted to him and even at times disgusted by the food he eats and the disregard for letting himself get so unhealthy (he is very short as well so this amount of weight on him is very obviously not healthy). It sounds terrible to say, but it is the truth."
1572,"I‚Äôm going to be brutally honest and say that I don‚Äôt think I could be attracted to someone who was overweight. They‚Äôd end up friend-zoned almost straight away. I‚Äôve never seen an overweight guy naked and the thought of a tubby stomach especially is really off-putting. 

I know this sounds really superficial, but it is what it is. I have my type and I‚Äôm very active myself."
1573,"I didn‚Äôt care when I married my first husband. He was chubby but he was charming and the funniest guy I‚Äôve ever met. Still to this day I haven‚Äôt met anyone who‚Äôs made me laugh the way he made me laugh, and I‚Äôve been a model most of my life. 

I don‚Äôt like how superficial people can be. There‚Äôs so much more to people than their appearances. I‚Äôd rather have a chubby husband who makes me laugh and treats me like a queen instead of a perfectly gorgeous man who doesn‚Äôt do either..."
1574,"I'm the chubby SO :,("
1575,"I work out several times a week and prepare mostly healthy food, my SO works very long days on his feet so rarely exercises and eats what‚Äôs available to him at work, which is rarely healthy. He‚Äôs still able to go on hikes and walks, to kayak, to do basic physical things just fine. He keeps himself put together as far as his hair and beard, clothes, etc. he‚Äôs such a wonderful human. The only times I feel bothered are when he mentions not liking his body, because he could prioritize eating well and exercising if he chose to. Overall, he has the body of someone who lives a lifestyle I enjoy (fitness as a hobby but not a mission, the occasional wing binge) and his character and personality more than make up for a few extra pounds."
1576,"I'm a super fit woman, I exercise everyday andI actually prefer my men with bellies than muscles by far, don't ask me why... and shag is awesome."
1577,I'm naturally thin woman. I am not attracted to fat men. My man is plain looking (not fat not thin) and I like this the best
1578,"I mean I‚Äôm not in perfect shape (21 f) but I was going to the gym consistently before the world stopped..my bf (20 m) doesn‚Äôt care about his health and it‚Äôs starting to drive me a little nuts. He‚Äôs constantly asking me to slow down when we‚Äôre walking together and asking if we can sit down when we go places (museums, parks, etc)

I agree with previous posts that it‚Äôs not really about not being attracted to someone because they‚Äôre overweight, but the fact that you‚Äôre worried about their health in the long run. Whenever I bring it up to him he just blows it off or gets upset with me for pointing out that he hasn‚Äôt had a vegetable in a couple days...granted we are in college but still..

Does anyone have any advise about this?"
1579,I love my mans body and his big tummy!! I think hes sexy no matter how he looks. He is also a confident guy which I find extremely attractive. I wouldnt change a thaaaang
1580,"I don‚Äôt care about physical appearance at all, I‚Äôm way too picky about personality for that shit. I also don‚Äôt see chubby as inherently unattractive, there are plenty of very attractive chubby people. I‚Äôm in good shape but that has nothing to do with trying to appeal to other people, I dislike people who can only see me for my body and I know damn well it‚Äôs the same for heavier people too. 
Someone I used to see was really adamant about never wanting to be with someone who is fat and I couldn‚Äôt understand that at all- in fact it made me lose all interest in them (along with some other similar things) because it sounded so damn superficial. Having a preference is one thing, but this person was straight up dehumanizing. And they said it thinking I‚Äôd be impressed or something, that‚Äôs when I realized they had no grasp on what kind of person I am at all and we had veeery different fundamental views. I don‚Äôt get it, I can‚Äôt force myself to care about someone just because they‚Äôre attractive, I have to actually like them and enjoy their company. Which sounds obvious but apparently there are people that don‚Äôt see it that way."
1581,"Not exactly in great shape anymore but working on it, I‚Äôve never had a problem with dating chubbier people. I don‚Äôt think looks or weight are much of a dealbreaker to me, but of course you need to still be able to be attracted to the person. What‚Äôs more important I think is if they‚Äôre independent, have similar values, you can enjoy their company and have fun together, and if they‚Äôre emotionally healthy and mature."
1582,"I like the dad bod, and my SO has one. He's still strong, and fit, he just carries some extra weight around his midsection. He's super comfy to snuggle with, and a wonderful human being on top of it. Best sex I've ever had, too."
1583,"I'm a distance trail runner and mountain biker, train over 10 hours a week, and look every bit of my activities. My husband is chubby, and I like it. He's just built to be a thicker person, even when he lost a fair bit of weight starting out in a new trade. I have been pushing him to start lifting/cycling more lately though,  for general health rather than aesthetics. His older family members are falling apart due to poor lifestyle choices and I've been pretty blunt in saying I don't want that for our future if it can be prevented."
1584,"I would say initially I do tend to go for fitter guys (not necessarily 6-pack buff gym bros, just anyone who looks decently healthy) - but I am also aware people change over time, and if you end up staying with someone for life it's not fair to expect them to always look like they did when you first met.

So for initial attraction I'd say it matters but not for creating a long term relationship.

Of course, often you just randomly fall for someone who's not your type. So there's that!"
1585,As long as it‚Äôs not killing them then it doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôm defiantly the health nut in my relationship but I will not push it on my SO. The only thing that bothers me is that he somehow has a better butt than me.
1586,"Look, being physically fit is attractive. A dad bod (don‚Äôt you hate that there isn‚Äôt a mom bod equivalent here?) isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker, but all else equal, I‚Äôm going for the fit guy. I honestly don‚Äôt think you can have really solid habits (both activity and diet) and not have it show up in your physique. I‚Äôm totally open to people in the earlier stages of their fitness journeys, but if you keep that up long enough, eventually it shows. I‚Äôm also big into cooking unprocessed foods at home most of the time ‚Äî I need to date someone who‚Äôs on board with this, too (or ideally wants to share the activity).

I am so repulsed by the idea of having to nag someone to do the basics to keep themselves healthy. If they don‚Äôt care about their own health, how can they care about the long-term sustainability of our partnership? 

You can‚Äôt change other people and I don‚Äôt want to change my priorities to accommodate someone with habits that aren‚Äôt aligned with mine. Being active is FUN and I want to share that with someone.

As an aside, I‚Äôve dated climbers, swimmers, powerlifters, runners ‚Äî all of these people were active, but none of them had the same body type. Our bodies change as we age, but I don‚Äôt want to be partners with someone who‚Äôs likely to give up (or already has)."
1587,"My man is a little soft around the belly and I LOVE IT. He's so cuddly and his belly is so cute and idk I just really like it. I genuinely never thought it was my thing, but I'm so in love with everything about  him goddamn"
1588,"I exercise regularly - 5 days a week, including running, cross-training/functional training, and yoga, although the latter two at home at the moment. My partner does not, and has a bit of a Dad bod.

It's fine. We do some physical stuff together like stand up paddleboarding and cycling (again, not at the moment), and he's not a lazy person at all. He's got a lot of personal self-improvement projects on the go, they're just not exercise-based. 

He'd like to get fitter, and I'd like to develop my other skills (tech! He's great at tech) so we're trying to help each other."
1589,"No Thankyou I could never be with someone who doesn‚Äôt lead an active lifestyle. I believe being fit shows you have great qualities such as self discipline, in contrast being overweight is indicative of a blatant disregard for your long term health and other bad habits/ denial. A little chub is ok, as long as he‚Äôs active."
1590,"I‚Äôm very slim and fit (runners body) and my dude is strong but with a ‚Äòdad bod‚Äô layer on top. That‚Äôs exactly my type, I looove it."
1591,"A while back with an ex I used to get pretty resentful. I mean, I tried to stay quiet about it because he was touchy but after a while I got really tired of having a partner who didn‚Äôt care about himself. Eventually I tried to get him to eat better/do little work outs with me but he never ‚Äúbounced back‚Äù per se and went back to old habits quick. Fast forward with a healthier relationship, I realize I can be okay with some weight gain as long as I know it‚Äôs healthy weight and they‚Äôre willing to take care of themselves as well."
1592,"Imo there‚Äôs a difference between out of shape and chubby. I prefer someone‚Äôs in shape but that applies to all body types, I have a really active lifestyle and I‚Äôd like someone who can match that. I like running, hiking, and climbing and I want a partner that can do that with me. I‚Äôve been with skinny guys who couldn‚Äôt keep up and chubby guys who could. I was much more attracted to the chubby guy who could keep up."
1593,"Before it wasn‚Äôt something I cared about, now it is. 

I‚Äôve always had struggles with food and body image, and I struggled with very restrictive eating and purging for years. Luckily for me I kind of grew out of it, I gained quite a bit of weight but then just focused on eating healthy and exercise, I was at a healthy weight and actually liked how I looked. I started dating someone who was kind of fat, didn‚Äôt exercise and only ate fast food. He always made fun of me for how I ate, and would encourage me to eat how he ate. I would make healthy meals and he would never eat it or eat with me so eventually I started eating what he ate and gained a fuck ton of weight. He then started making fun of me for being fat and it killed my self esteem so I latched onto the bad food even more and developed binge eating disorder. My lowest weight was 110 and I got up to 262. I‚Äôve been working really hard to break my food addiction and lose weight, so I‚Äôm getting out of it and losing weight again finally. I can‚Äôt blame him entirely, i am my own person and he didn‚Äôt force me to do anything, but I do strongly feel that I would have never ended up like that if I didn‚Äôt date someone like that. But obviously I don‚Äôt know that so I make sure to hold myself responsible for what I have done. 

So now I‚Äôm afraid of gaining weight again, and am just not attracted to unhealthy overweight people because it reminds me of the worst time of my life. Fitness and healthy eating has become really important to me again, so I would want a partner who would be supportive and encouraging of a healthier lifestyle."
1594,"I dated a guy last year who was pretty chubby‚Äîdefinitely in the overweight but not obese category. I think to some degree I just don‚Äôt notice pounds on a guy the way I do a girl. The chub was something I really didn‚Äôt think much about. 

However, the thing that caused me to walk away was how he did not respect the difference in lifestyle. He wanted a hot gf but got pretty upset when I would go to the gym everyday after work and so didn‚Äôt have time to see him. He also kept bringing me baked goods and I asked him so many times not to because I don‚Äôt eat a lot of it and so I ended up throwing it out. At first I accepted the gifts and tossed them in the trash without him knowing. After getting a week of 15 brownies every day, I asked him to stop because it was wildly out of line with my personal goals. He said he would stop but didn‚Äôt. The next week he gave me a lift somewhere and surprise! A tub of cookies. This time I didn‚Äôt accept them and told him to keep them. He got VERY offended by that but I felt like I had to get to that level to convey the message. 

Obviously, there was quite a lot more. And I don‚Äôt want to villanize him here‚Äî he showed affection by giving me food gifts, but it wasn‚Äôt a form of affection I was really comfortable with in the amount that he needed it. Likewise it‚Äôs completely normal to want to spend time with your significant other, but if you want a ‚Äúhot‚Äù gf that looks like she goes to the gym everyday, you have to understand that you‚Äôre going to have to let her go to the gym and not get that time for you. It‚Äôs a trade off."
1595,I wouldn‚Äôt date someone who wasn‚Äôt in shape.
1596,"I don‚Äôt necessarily work-out, but I am naturally smaller & I don‚Äôt mean to sound cocky but I have a great body. I don‚Äôt mind what my SO looks like. I care more about personality then I do looks. Beauty fades with age. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1597,"Everyone gets old and ugly one day. I think men in general are way more concerned with having the ‚Äúbest looking‚Äù than women are. Which is why women try so hard. There‚Äôs exceptions both ways of course but that‚Äôs just my opinion. Women of course are gonna lust over a hot guy but a lot of that vanity wears off as we mature and by the time we reach mid twenties it doesn‚Äôt matter as much.  We‚Äôve already been through trying to impress everyone with good looks and eventually a lot of us kinda realize how shallow and unhappy it makes us. We just want someone to appreciate us for something other than just being hot or good looking. 

I would much rather have an average guy who has skills, talents, a brain, something to talk about and isn‚Äôt lewd all the time, over some hot guy who thinks he is still an overgrown frat boy. That‚Äôs just my two cents as a reasonably attractive woman."
1598,"I am quite health conscious (NOT extreme, I have a sweet thing every now and then and I'm all for everything in moderation!) so for me, I would not date a partner from the get go who was not at least moderately health conscious. With that said, you can be ""chubbier"" and still be healthy. So for me it's all about how overall health conscious are you. Do you strive for clean eating? Do you try to practice good habits? Do you do some form of exercise? If yes, I'd definitely still give it a go even if you are on the chubbier side."
1599,"My ex husband gained 40lbs the first year we were married. It was hard to know how to discuss it. But that wasn‚Äôt why I left. His whole personality had changed. He used to be really active and was up for any adventure I‚Äôd think of. And then once we were married, he wouldn‚Äôt even take a walk around the block. There were far more serious and awful reasons I chose to divorce him but I do believe that exterior appearances are, to some extent, reflective of interior issues.

I remarried a professional athlete. I‚Äôm a yoga teacher / personal trainer and nutritionist. We love being active together and we love working really hard. The sex is 1000% better with someone who has the same level of energy, too! My ex starved himself when I left, literally. He then met a new woman who was obese and they got married. He gained at least 60lbs back and seems larger every time I see him. He also wears only black since I left... 

For me, it all comes down to compatibility. If my spouse can‚Äôt keep up, that‚Äôs a bummer. If they have a bad attitude about doing something fun outside, that‚Äôs a dealbreaker."
1600,"Dude, he is awesome. I wouldn't want to date a man who doesnt have a bit of squish. Hugs are better, snuggling is better etc."
1601,"I started working out to impress him (essentially) and I was hurt at first when he wasn‚Äôt motivated to do the same (I was emotional, 19, DOnT judge we‚Äôre human whatever) and I didn‚Äôt want to bring it up at first but I really thought it was about his attraction to me. Then I matured and realized that dating a guy who has good self-esteem about his appearance is a journey and that his journey back to getting in shape is gonna be longer than mine. I wanted to support him in it by letting it go, essentially‚Äînot mentioning it. I‚Äôm happy to say he‚Äôs working out ON HIS OWN & I ONLY encourage him when I hear about it. It‚Äôs his body, his mind. I‚Äôve dated muscle guys, but having dated a muscle guy who was insecure about his body and a muscle guy who was, I gotta say that both of those sucked because they didn‚Äôt give a sh*t about my feelings, pardonez-mon fran√ßais. This is the most sincere and compassionate man I‚Äôve had the pleasure of beginning to know and he‚Äôs been so supportive in my difficult life experiences that I learned quickly that the superficial is.. just superficial."
1602,"I def would prefer someone who shares the same lifestyle and motivation to keep in shape.  My current bf and future husband has never cared too much about ‚Äúlooking‚Äù super fit. However, he does love playing sports and will go workout with me.  He told me this past January was the most he‚Äôs ever consistently went to the gym and it was all thanks to me.  I do wish I didn‚Äôt always have to push him to go to the gym, but I‚Äôm fine if he doesn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs at a good weight.  If he starts letting go and not caring about his health whatsoever, then I will definitely address my concern."
1603,"I think in the beginning stages of dating, it would be a dealbreaker to me. I‚Äôm not fit to the point of being ripped or excessively counting calories, but I like to look and feel good. It‚Äôs hard for me to be attracted to someone physically who isn‚Äôt fit when I‚Äôm not yet invested in them. Now if I‚Äôm already knee deep in my feels and he gained a little weight/got chubby, it wouldn‚Äôt bother me much."
1604,"I've always been attracted to chubbier men. Laying with them is the best cause they're just so soft! Everyone has a taste and if they really are the one, they'll love you just the way you are. This shouldn't keep you from improving on yourself though. If you're not satisfied with your body, try hard to get that body you want. Either way, just love yourself, which is important step prior to a serious relationship."
1605,All bodies are fine to me
1606,I‚Äôve always been fairly slim. Not perfect. But pretty slim. And I love chubby guys. They are more cuddly and it doesn‚Äôt hurt that my chubby boyfriend is the sweetest guy ever
1607,"I don't really work out for the sake of it, but I'm active and I've got a naturally good physique for a woman... and I honestly prefer guys with ""dad bods."" I dont know why, I just like my men to have a little squish. I'm suuuuuper attracted to guys with strong arms but still a lil bit of a gut, if that makes sense. No logic to it, just how I'm wired I guessü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1608,Ever love someone so much that everything about them is sexy? I am not the least bit turned off or unattracted. I think that‚Äôs how it should be.
1609,"I was with my partner and I always tried to encourage him to live a healthier lifestyle with diet and exercise. His weight gain was a result from a traumatic event and the depression that followed after. I have to admit, throughout our 3 years of being together, I would become frustrated at his lack of consideration/commitment to his health. ‚ÄúMcDonalds... are you serious? ...‚Äù I would say. I was always just so frustrated because I was scared of him becoming sick or I would think about our future and me having to take him to doctors appointments when we‚Äôre old... I shouldn‚Äôt have put all that pressure on him but it was always important to me. Now I‚Äôve learned to just plant the seed, water it with my example and see if it grows. He‚Äôs been monitoring how he feels after every meal and working out more."
1610,"I want to break this answer into two parts, if the girl is just naturally in shape, no exercise, from my friends experiences, they don‚Äôt mind having someone with a bit of extra ‚Äúcushionage‚Äù.

For a girl who is fit and maintains herself through exercise, dating a chubby guy is more an indication of habits and different lifestyle choices, for me I don‚Äôt mind if my SO is a bit chubby, it‚Äôs more looking at whether our lifestyles and values are the same when it comes to health and fitness. I‚Äôve also noticed from a few occasions dating a chubbier guy that they are insecure and tend to self-sabotage the relationship which is not pleasant. 

It‚Äôs not as superficial a question asking if a fit girl would date an unfit guy, you have to look at the health component, the habits and lifestyle and the psychology and mental component too from my experience. 

Hope this helps x"
1611,"Having a similar lifestyle is important in a relationship, but it doesn't necessarily have to be everything. For me though, having a spouse who cares about his body and health is much more attractive than someone who eats unhealthily and couldn't give two flying funyuns about their appearance. More than that, I believe that when someone loves you, they want to be present for you- emotionally and physically. Therefore, taking good care of their health, internally and externally, is paramount.

To me, taking care of oneself says, ""I love you. And, I want to be around on this planet for you, for our future kids and for as long as I possibly can.""

I've witnessed and experienced before the affects of what not really caring about one's body/fitness and health can do to negatively impact a relationship, and that's not something I want to go through or witness anymore. Yes, I accept my spouse as they are wholly and completely. This is important. It isn't as much about the looks though as it is about the health aspect.

At the same time though, it makes logical sense to me that-  
When you deeply love yourself and you deeply love your spouse, then taking care of your body is a beautiful act of love and commitment. 

It says, ""I'm in this for the long-haul, I want to be strong and beautiful because I love myself and I love you. And, because I love my past/present/future self and because I love you,   
I vow to take good care of myself because I don't plan on going anywhere."""
1612,"I'm under weight and my husband is over weight. I love him because he is a good man. He is honest, compassionate, smart, funny, loves my kids like his own and so many other wonderful things. How can his weight negate any of those amazing qualities? Do we both wish the other was healthier, yes. But we choose to focus on the good and work on the rest together. I love him and find his super sexy because we fit together. Our weirds match up. He is the best partner I've ever had."
1613,"My partner (recently ex) was overweight. He had a lot of insecurities mostly related to the fact I earned several times his income but also to do with his own appearance. He projected his lack of weight control onto me, wanting me to do more exercise, join a gym with him and would insult me about my appearance. 

He became verbally abusive and controlling to the point I thought we needed to break up before I got stuck with him trying to control me during lockdown. 

I didnt mind his body type. It was his insecurities that ruined everything for us."
1614,"I used to date 2 chubby guys and I didn't mind it, but they'd eat so much that I'd end up gaining weight when with them which made me insecure and self-conscious. Other than that l loved the both of them and was attracted to their face and personality."
1615,"I wouldn't call my body in 'excellent' shape (like what you see on Instagram or something) but I've been genetically blessed with the kind of metabolism and natural muscle mass that simply eating clean and doing daily light to moderate yoga is enough for me to become as toned as others who have to work much harder for it. Not trying to blow my own trumpet here, on the contrary: I know how hard others have to struggle to get there.

I just don't find overly fit bodies particularly titillating to look at? I can appreciate the aesthetic beauty and the work that has gone into a very fit, toned body but it just doesn't do anything for me in terms of attraction. I find a sixpack more of a turn off than a turn on. No idea why. I like a bit of 'padding' on a man. Like PhilosophyTube for example. That is the kind of body I find attractive. You can see him in the nude in his video on Jordan Peterson. No idea what the jargon is for that kind of body. Chubby? Dad bod? Skinny fat? (Also I have a thing for ample chest hair, which he has, so that may play into it too)"
1616,"No one is ""blessed"" with a fit body."
1617,"my guy is a little heavy and he is very self conscious about it. (he was pretty fit and sporty a bit before we met but he collapsed mentally which led to stress eating, y‚Äôall know where i getting at) 
i personally think he is the out right most attractive man i‚Äôve seen. to add to that he is comfy and squishy to hug n shit. he also is just the sweetest guy i know. 
all that aside, i didn‚Äôt really ‚Äòrealize‚Äô/saw past it when we met and had no idea it was a thing he wasn‚Äôt fine with until opening up about it with me. 
(i‚Äôm not gonna sit here and type out our business and how i handled it or how this and that)
i‚Äôm just saying most really don‚Äôt mind as long as youre healthy, and a decent person ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1618,"I am pretty fit, but my boyfriend is about 40 pounds overweight. I wouldn't say he's lazy or eats excessively, he just eats foods that are really bad for him and have a lot of calories. His body shape never bothered me. However, if he continues to gain weight, I will be talking to him about it because it could compromise his health. I try to encourage him to eat better, but so far have been unsuccessful!"
1619,"I don‚Äôt mind at all. I love my husband any way I can get him. It doesn‚Äôt hurt our sex life at all. My husband is very cute, but personality is 100% what I care about."
1620,I'm on the thin side while my partner is fat. I love their belly. Im not attracted to muscles and super fit people.
1621,"I'm kind of split on this topic. It seems that in media women are encouraged to give men a chance who aren't considered on the same level of attraction as them. 
However you rarely see the opposite situation happening.

And now I can't help (rather cynically) but wonder how many of those top comments are influenced by such media, because they do argue the same points that the media does: ""He treats me so well. I don't really care that he doesn't meet my physical standards"". But the thought that I can't seem to shake is if those same women weren't attractive themselves they likely wouldn't be together in the first place."
1622,"Idk if I am in excellent shape or whatever. I mean I have kinda big boobs and I exercise yk. I dont have like a model like figure but I mean my friends and some guys have complimented my body idk. That being said no. I literally don't care about physical appearance. I am and have always been attracted to personalities. I am attracted to people that are mentally strong and can take care of me in a sense. I am naturally submissive, so I am naturally attracted to people who take charge, are confident, and have leader like qualities. People who can stand up in a packed room and speak their mind. That's attractive to me. That's what draws me to them. Literally, physique is not that important. Idk why it's such a big deal. As long as the person is taking care of themselves and living a healthy lifestyle, who cares? :)"
1623,"Mmmm I‚Äôm not in the situation but I would just want to make sure my partner is happy and has nice levels of energy from eating right foods, and make sure the wrong foods don‚Äôt harm him.. that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd be concerned with not necessarily the physical aspect first"
1624,Anything that is changeable is not a deal breaker
1625,"It depends, I dated someone who didn‚Äôt have ideal body and I was ok for the most part, what let me down was that he was always complaining how he felt unfit. Like literally every day and then would do absolutely nothing about, and I fact would continue gaining more weight. He would make plans to go to the gym, get a PT, start running, which would all fall flat after a month or so.

EDIT: I tried helping him. When he said he wanted to get healthy I asked my PT friend to train him. I helped him to do this mental wheel thing that my therapist taught me. He asked me to restrict his takeaways, I tried doing that too but he just got mad at me instead. He didn‚Äôt like local gym so we joined this super fancy gym 20 min walk away which he quit like 4 months later"
1626,"I‚Äôm a slim woman. I dated a 300 lb guy for a year and loved every second of it. We broke up because of distance, but I loved him for his fun and sweet personality, and I was attracted to his charisma and charm‚Ä¶he made me swoon! The sex was unbelievable too. I would recommend not discounting the possibility :)"
1627,"my sister (19F) has the body of a goddess. All females in (mums side) have been blessed with a hourglass figure, and she also does triathlon. Her bf (18M) is very chubby, he doesn‚Äôt do sports. I asked my sister about this in the beginning of their relationship (about 4 months ago) and I think this is really true:
 ‚Äú(my name) I don‚Äôt need an athlete to make me happy, sport for me is not about the perfect body but about something that motivates me, he has things that motivates him and it is inspiring to watch him work hard for those. Im glad he doesn‚Äôt waist time on sports or getting fit if these things don‚Äôt matter to him.‚Äù"
1628,"I definitely like guys with a little bit of a belly. They make the best cuddler‚Äôs and they give the best hugs. I don‚Äôt like a partner that is extremely overweight but I would rather date a guy with a tummy than a 6-pack.

Edit: I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the kind of girl you mean in this post. I‚Äôm not a fitness buff and I like to lay around. I‚Äôm just skinny because I‚Äôm young and my body doesn‚Äôt gain weight easy."
1629,"I personally don‚Äôt mind my bf is out of shape, I sometimes even find it hot haha. When you really love someone (atleast for me) you become attracted to whatever they are. I describe it like looking at your mom, she may not be magazine stunning but you still think she‚Äôs beautiful because you love her."
1630,"I do a decent amount of exercise to stay in shape, whereas my SO is on the chubby side. It doesn't affect us being able to do things together (in fact, he's stronger than me and actually more capable at many things), HOWEVER he regularly complains that he doesn't like being overweight, which bothers me. One, because him saying he's unattractive makes me see him that way, and two, because I'm a doer and find it unattractive when people complain about a resolvable issue but don't attempt to resolve it. I still love him and find him attractive most of the time, but the complaining (when it happens) is a big turn-off."
1631,im a boy and got this in my recommended and its the first time feeling awkward for having a fit body lol
1632,"I take good care of my body and make healthy choices, and I‚Äôd want my partner to be the same. To a degree. 

However, I‚Äôm super lean, and that‚Äôs genetic / high metabolism stuff. Which I understand is not realistic for lots of people and I wouldn‚Äôt expect leanness, or even want it. I like heavier built men. Think lumberjack. 

But I would need someone healthy, who takes care of himself, and puts in effort."
1633,"When I met my partner I was in great shape and he was on the edge of being a little chubby. But it was the nice, teddy bearish type of chubby, and I liked it. 
We went through a tough time together where we both bloated up, and both became overweight. I realised I hated how I looked and began working hard to lose it all, started participating in a sport, and now I'm back to a good weight, but this time with muscles! He never lost his weight though, he yo-yos weight wise but never gets back down to where he was.

I love him to pieces, I still find him attractive, even if he's a much bigger teddy bear than the one I started with. But I worry about his health, and I've tried gently encouraging him to lose the extra weight."
1634,"To be fair I don't really see it. I mean I know he is a bit chubby ofcourse and I do think a little fat off the belly would suit him better but if he is comfortable with it, I am fine with it. I know he himself finds himself less attractive because of it which I think is mostly the problem. Yet I can't really compliment him on it either, I don't hate it but I don't love it either. I compliment him on other body parts though, my man has amazing legs!"
1635,I only like non exclusive dating with multiple people at once & am not attracted to chubby people
1636,"Its big boi season every season imo! As long as he's physically healthy I don't mind a lil gut. I've been with really skinny men that were insecure and really jacked men that were too about themselves/critical of me but I find the ""dad bod"" types to be the most well-rounded, funny guys and that might be what attracts me to them?? I like being able to wrap myself up in a big guy too, its all around what I look for."
1637,"In my experience women who are fit have even higher standards for the men they date, like if her arms are fat-free the dude better have a six pack.  Though there are obviously exceptions.

It also depends on where you live. In some parts of the country there are basically an unlimited number of hot people and if you meet the criteria to ""join the club"" you can be a part of hot society. In other parts of the country there aren't that many hot people and if you get fit you're still surrounded by pudgy people so that's who you are going to date."
1638,One of my mom's best friends is fairly overweight. His wife is a nutritionist and fitness expert. She has no interest in changing who he is... for that is exactly the guy she married and has been married to for 40 years or so. They're ridiculously in love.
1639,"I‚Äôve dated really fit guys and really unfit guys. And honestly I‚Äôve noticed I just prefer dad bods(somewhere in the middle) my SO is big time dad bod. And to me it‚Äôs just more comforting. 

And this is just my experience. Fit guys tend to all follow the same stereotyped personality and they‚Äôre not as relaxed. I don‚Äôt feel judged when i eat a chocolate bar in front of my husband. Or a week without exercising. 

I should be mention I used to be super fit, working out everyday, six pack gal. But due to injury, I cannot Lift weights anymore. And I can only do cardio now. And my body isn‚Äôt the same. And if I had stayed with any of the fit guys I was with, I would‚Äôve felt like shit. My SO doesn‚Äôt give an F if I work out or not. 

I‚Äôm not judging any fit guys in general. Just out of my experience alone."
1640,">If I have to accept a flaw, I would rather it be a few extra pounds than something worse.

That's a good perspective, thank you."
1641,Amen
1642,I say everyone has at least one flaw. I‚Äôd rather my partner to have an external flaw vs an internal flaw.

1646,"> ""stocky brunette dude with big eyebrows and a distinguished nose"", which may come with a side of physical softness.

I‚Äôm dying. This is my boyfriend to a tee lmao."
1647,"I literally got into a fight with my Bf about exactly this. He thought I was attacking  his appearance and weight, I wasn‚Äôt. I was thinking about how I wanted to go hiking in the Dolomites later this year, how I want to travel 10yrs from now and go on walks. He has to start doing something so when the doctors tell him he *has* to change it‚Äôs not too hard to do it.  

He seems to finally understand my point of view so hopefully changes happen. We shall see"
1648,"I agree with your comment. Most women don‚Äôt want a muscle man. We‚Äôre attracted to an emotional connection and not as much visual to a certain point. 

I like taking very good care of myself and I want someone to do things with me, but I‚Äôm not asking to climb Mt. Everest. It‚Äôs just a matter of caring about their health and just working on it. 

And bonus points if they go to their annual physical/blood work GP, optometrist, and dentist visits. Now, THAT is impressive!"
1649,This is a beautiful and honest comment. Upvoted
1650,[removed]
1651,"I think this here is really what it comes down to. Your appearance is going to hint at what your lifestyle, values, mindset might be. So when you're attempting to find a match on say Tinder or some other superficial platform like that the people you select will probably look a certain way.

Like I go to the gym every now and then but I'm still quite chunky, get take out, like my video games a bit too much. Matching with a buff looking guy I can't keep up with is probably just gonna frustrate both of us."
1652,"THIS. WTF is that about when non-fit people try to make fit people feel bad about our habits? It's not just relationships, I've had friends try to make me eat unhealthy, try to tell me to stop working out because I'm small already etc. You HAVE to surround yourself with people on the same wavelength when it comes to health and fitness because these comments get old pretty fast."
1653,"This became apparent to me with my ex-boyfriend. He liked playing video games and watching tv/movies when not working. I like tv and film too, but I can't sit still too long, I get restless. And being almost 30 and not knowing how to cook was weird, I started cooking when I was 11 because my mom drank a lot at that time. It just became obvious to me that not only were we from different worlds, but our lifestyle was very different."
1654,I can see that.
1655,Yup this is what happened to me. He even went so far as to say that it made him self conscious to eat and drink alone because I wouldn‚Äôt participate. We broke up. Still a super fit and healthy person to this day!
1656,"All of my ex bfs have fitness instagrams and are obsessed with health. Literally all 3 of them.

My husband is built like John Goodman and I can‚Äôt get enough"
1657,Me too. Strong build but with a belly is my personal favourite!
1658,"Same same! I'm a lifter and cyclist and a (sometimes) runner, downhill skiier, and and and haha. I've always been attracted to bigger / chubbier guys (6', 250-350lb range). It's just what I'm into. My husband is deff within that range but also runs and cycles, so while he's less athletic than me we can still hike and cycle and stuff.  And I also do lots of athletic things on my own. It's a good balance imo. For me my athletisism isn't an appearance thing so much as these are my hobbies and stuff, so what is there to resent about that? You don't inherently need to share all the same hobbies with your partner, that's silly."
1659,Ditto. I love a chubby dad-bod physique.
1660,Happy to hear this is common. I‚Äôm much more attracted to men who are slightly chubby but healthy or skinny healthy than a fit guy. I workout daily and am very fit but I‚Äôm not attracted to fit men at all. Dad bod are wonderfully sexy!
1661,Ditto. Chubby guys are like teddy bears. It feels so good to cuddle with them.
1662,[removed]
1663,"Me too! I love my big cuddly Bear. I like looking at nice fit bodies, but give me a soft embrace to curl up with at night!"
1664,Same. Not attracted to fit guys. Dad bod all the way.
1665,"I consider myself a chubby chaser too. I just went to see if there was a community of us, there was but oh god, it‚Äôs not what I thought. It should also be a NSFW community. Ugh my eyes"
1666,"Same boat here!
I love having fluff to hug"

1669,I am denise mahoney from Scrubs and I confirm this.
1670,[removed]
1671,It doesn't sound dumb at all. It sounds great!!
1672,"I don't know what happened with all the deleted comments above lol, but I agree with you. I don't think I could ever date someone who isn't into fitness at all. My ex was extremely thin and I was always a bit disappointed that I could never get him to take care of himself a little."
1673,"I'm with this! I work hard, I expect my husband to also, and we have an agreement about continuing to try to stay fit. To be fair, we are weirdos whose wedding vows also mentioned flossing (as in teeth, not as in the dance).  But we've been together 21 years and counting, and are happy."
1674,i definitely agree
1675,"This is the sort of relationship I want, but I've never been able to find anyone to get into it with me."
1676,"My girlfriend is pretty damn fit even though she eats nearly twice as much as I do. I've got a fair bit of chub. I don't look fat, but I feel a little self-conscious about it. So I was surprised and flattered when she said she likes my body. She doesn't really work out, but she does yoga which she's teaching me. And we like to hike and bike a lot which is cool. Overall, I really like having an active partner. It's something great to enjoy together.

&#x200B;

edit: she said she's gained some weight recently, from before we met, and she complains that she looks fat in some pictures, but I really can't see it. She looks amazing to me."
1677,"That‚Äôs really great! I am hesitant to say this because I don‚Äôt mean it in a body shame-y kind of way, but I wish my husband would get back into fitness. It was one of the early things we bonded over together and spent much of our first year or so dating running and lifting together. Now he‚Äôs kind of... stopped all that. And it sucks. He‚Äôs not overweight now, just a little bit chubby. That isn‚Äôt the part that bugs me: it‚Äôs that we no longer have fitness in common and more importantly, he‚Äôs not taking care of his mental health by not taking care of his body."
1678,I think you meant through Thicc and thin ;)
1679,Thick and thin. I get it
1680,I don‚Äôt want men with bad hygiene to touch me. Total turn off!
1681,Same. I‚Äôm just not physically attracted to men who do not exercise. It‚Äôs more of a mental health thing for me. Keeps me balanced and disciplined. I prefer to have that in a partner as well.
1682,"Is there a difference between ""fit"" and ""muscular"" for you? I'm a tall and skinny guy, and I'm sure I could get toned, but my body type doesn't lend itself to the stereotypically ripped male figure. Curious if it's a body type thing for you or just a matter of being in shape."
1683,Bingo. Habits are just that...habits. Things catch up with us the older we get. I want to have the best quality of life I can as long as I can ‚Äî and part of that is hopefully sharing it with a partner. I don‚Äôt want to be widowed young or dealing with someone in poor heath way before they reach old age. Enough diseases/injuries/accidents happen without our habits increasing the likelihood that they do.
1684,[removed]
1685,Sounds semi toxic
1686,"I'm curious, how does he project his insecurities onto you if you're thin..?"
1687,Girl you make me wanna work out right now.
1688,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äùand can only eat between 1000-1500 to maintain my weight. I totally understand. I can‚Äôt eat 3 real meals a day like most. It really does suck to be small. The only way to keep a healthy lifestyle is calorie counting. I do have ice cream every once in awhile.
1689,How exactly is weight not correlated with health?
1690,but weight *is* directly correlated to health
1691,[removed]
1692,Fat acceptance was never about forcing people to be attracted to fat people. Just that fat people deserve to be treated with respect and not constantly shit on or used as the butt of jokes.
1693,So you correlate chubbiness with being less physically attractive?
1694,[deleted]
1695,Lol at the lil ponytail :)
1696,"Also, I like to hike, so I'd also want to be with someone who enjoys or at least is up for that!"
1697,"100% this, it's all about attitude. If you are happy with your body, it's not my place to try to make you change. If you are unhappy with your body but don't do anything about it, that's where I have a problem. It isn't even just body either - I dated a guy who was very unhappy in his work situation, but didn't take any action, and that was infuriating to the point where I broke up with him."

1708,"Lately it's been easy to have 12 hour lifting a week since I have nothing else to do at home lol. But I genuinely love weightlifting so it's very easy for me to be in the gym/doing my thing at home and suddenly an hour is already passed. Getting started isn't so much about motivation but discipline. I have certain body goals, requiring me to do certain things. If the things they require are ""too much"" for me, I reassess my goals and find a good balance. Honestly it's harder for me to control my portion size than it is to get my butt into the gym/my equipment at home. I really love food! 

On the other hand I absolutely hate cardio and only do it for health benefits so I'd slog away on the elliptical for half an hour before getting to the fun (for me) lifting part. With gyms and such closed though I'm taking lots of hour long socially distanced walks while I have the chance, just enjoying the scenery and the sun on my skin.

So I guess the tldr is to find something you don't mind if not outright enjoy doing and be realistic with yourself about goals/effort and what you're willing/able to do to meet those goals."

1711,Me too lmaoooo
1712,"This is a very real concern.  I never cared that my S/O was not in the best shape from an aesthetic viewpoint, 

BUT 

once we retired and began visiting the National Parks, it really sucked he could not even begin to keep up with me.  I know it bothered him as much as it disappointed me.  It‚Äôs not as much fun to hike alone, but it was either that or miss the fantastic sights.  Also, he‚Äôd often push himself too hard while assuring me he was fine, then he‚Äôd be too sore to move the next few days, which made me feel terrible.   It really hurt our relationship.  I hope you can avoid this."
1713,"This is such bs.  We are visual. We're often just shamed into hiding it. Burying what we were *really* attracted to. Why????  *When society and most men are going to be doubly shallow towards you,*  no matter how ""real"" and ""non-shallow"" you are. Is that even really real???

Its not a matter of being male or female and being fat...Its really disgusting to me that I've known REALLY beautiful women who treat themselves like waste. Get with rude,  meh,  ugly, cruel,  controlling,  suffocating  men because ""all they want is an emotional connection,  they will endure anything for an ""emotional connection"" but they live their lives like they feel nothing. Maybe they never even learned to feel real attraction to anybody. Or all they do is get off to kink with someone,  because ""kink is enough"" or ""kink is feeling"".

Meanwhile how many really attractive men do you know with huge egos? Even meh men with huge egos??? You should be asking yourself if you're attractive either way. Why should just one gender do most of it???  And it doesn't come close to warranting an ego.  I think being self conscious, is more virtuous. You are less likely to be pig headed. You're more likely to be self-aware and open to doubting yourself.

I think being a gold digger,  being a succubus,  sleeping around hooking up constantly are all awful in some way but being genuinely attracted to someone visually is natural and real,  its not lying to yourself.

Almost every other female creature on earth is visual. Maybe there is a reason for that. Why shouldn't i be???"
1714,Absolutely. So true. I‚Äôve never been into the super cut muscle men. It‚Äôs not attractive to me. I like strong with a bit of a dad bod layer to top it off.

I go for a manly look for sure and so all the guys I've dated seriously since when I started in high school had a toned to-ripped look (played sports). These qualities are fairly easy to achieve after months of consistency in the gym and eating healthy. I do not look for the steroid jacked up look but skinny with no weight-lifting related definition is not my taste in men neither.

In his defence, he absolutely loves food.  I don‚Äôt give a shit about food.  He lives to eat and I eat to live.  I don‚Äôt feel hungry and on the rare occasion I do, even at 3am I get up and cook something.  When he feels stressed or anything, the answer is food.

It's only recently I've even begun to see shows that our exclusively female gazey, and I enjoy it more like.. ""finally, we are closer to getting equality! Maybe some younger girl watching this will have an easier time figuring out what she likes in men and that she CAN have standards and sexual expectations."" Because you're totally right every other schlubby guy expects to be with a 10 and hot women are all feeling like crap about themselves. It's so fucked up."
1743,"I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre angry. Of course visual attraction is important, but women are genetically nurturers too. Also, I‚Äôm 43 and experienced a good amount of adult life. At 22, I was more shallow. However, as you get older and priorities change, you realize you‚Äôre not going to be able to be a size 4 and at top physical shape all of the time. 

And the hot guy at 22 can easily go bald,   become a diabetic, blow a knee, or age terribly over time. So can you. So, only in my opinion, it‚Äôs good to find someone who cares for their overall health whether they have an extra 20lbs or not isn‚Äôt that big of a deal unless their diet is ridiculous and lacks nutrition. Someone can be thin and eat like shit too. 

And I did say, most. So. if you don‚Äôt relate to it, that‚Äôs ok."
1744,"Oh yeah totally that's why I said 'hint'. You don't really know anything about anyone without chatting to them. Hence the flaw of dating apps etc but it is what it is.

I guess if you want to convey that sort of info maybe be mindful of where pictures are taken, what else is in the photo."

1761,Evidence for women being genetically more nurturing? Or have their roles always been the caretakers?
1762,"I'm sorry but that's really not true. Keep your gross generalizations of a woman's biology to yourself. Women are visually attracted to men, but it's proven that women on a whole seem to be attracted to different things in men's appearance. Some like men muscular, others lean or blond, or brown haired or whatever. So what may be attractive to you will likely differ from another woman. However you will generally experience attraction. You said that your priorities change but has nothing to do with the physical attraction you feel to a person. Women are just more encouraged by society to settle for men not equal to their own level of attraction. Women who don't are called shallow."

1770,"I think most people in general get in a relationship to say they're in a relationship for friendship, resources, or for the points. Feeling is not popular, the illusion of feeling is. I mean you said it yourself. ""you're only young for a little while... some people are naturally nurturing"" Obviously friendship, resources are great but they're not everything.. it can lead to such profound boredom when you get into anything for points. Really none of that is what matters to me though, its expectations the genders learn. The expectation to judge yours level of sensitivity. I think a guy thats self-conscious, who learns plenty of balancing, regulating self-doubt is really attractive because his personality naturally becomes more in tuned to others outside himself.  Why the heck cant we expect both sides to be nurturing and not entitled to less shame???

Why should only one half of the population /be responsible/ for emotional labor and CONSCIENTIOUS self-regulation????? I know somewhere someones going to try to say ""well men are in their own way"" But they don't live under this perpetual shame, drama, internet harassment cloud that makes women really sensitive, either do they? In reply to your other comment, what does being visual have to do with not being nurturing? Why cant a person be both? Why do we have to align bottomless hedonism or immorality with being visual?? It is so damn /easy/ to be a woman who is visual and say ""I'm not going to rape a person, I'm not going to sexually harass a person, I'm not going to degrade a person at my job, I'm not going to ignore the human trafficking in porn, im not going to be a pedophile.""

One side has more self control than the other, in my opinion, because of cultural expectations."
1771,Now if a guy completely stopped taking care of himself and gained 60lbs and became totally lazy. Of course I‚Äôd have a problem with it just like a guy would.

1773,"Ya I get what you mean, but why can‚Äôt I as feminine women say, attraction and health are very important, but I want an emotional connection and refuse to objectify men as men have objectified women and they can go fuck themselves if that‚Äôs all they are looking for? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è(Traditionally speaking) I‚Äôm not reducing my criteria for who I‚Äôm looking for, but being in the gym isn‚Äôt everything. And in my experience, that really isn‚Äôt sustainable.

I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want to conform to how men think either. I think we‚Äôve done that in many ways in the past. I used to dress and act more masculine/professional and work like men, because the only leaders in our country have been men in the corporate world. And now I have to cut off my emotional intelligence? I don‚Äôt want to do that."
1774,"Where  did i say objectify men?  What does being visual have to do with objectifying anybody? Obviously emotional connection is a given.  That's what i meant by friendship companionship.  What does any of this have to do with cutting out emotional intelligence?  Just because i can think
analytically doesn't mean i give up emotional intelligence.  My whole point is that everyone's better off knowing how to use both."
1775,"Making my students feel loved and valued. So many students come from awful situations and my classroom is their refuge. I hope I have touched at least one of their lives, and if so, that‚Äôs my greatest accomplishment. Im missing them a lot right now."
1776,"Scoring in the top 0.1% in the nation of an academic test. 

Yeah, I peaked in high school and haven‚Äôt done much with my life afterwards."
1777,Having written a book
1778,"realizing the dream of arriving in a new country as a foreign bride, surviving abuse. then building a happy life, remarrying for love, earning a degree and citizenship.

when i write that it feels like some THING i just DID, you know? but all i did was kept going."
1779,My child.
1780,"Having helped tens if not hundreds of families by translating for them since I was a kid. For things like applying for an apartment, doctors appointments, opening bank accounts, filing paperwork for whatever they need, applying for jobs, job interviews, etc.

Having helped college grads with their resumes, interviewing skills, and networking skills for entry level jobs. I still do this now.

Being an amazing aunt and loving sister. And hopefully a good daughter too.

And hopefully a good girlfriend to my ex and having helped him get through some tough spots. We may have parted on not the best of terms and don‚Äôt talk anymore, but he is still someone that played a very big part in my life and helped me grow as a person."
1781,Tomorrow? My luck at getting fired TODAY from a job I hated.
1782,Becoming a doctor I guess
1783,My son.
1784,My daughters
1785,"I guess wanting to be alive. It's a strange thing for me still, when I spent about 15 years being suicidal to some degree (including suicde attempts)."
1786,"Touching the lives of others in a positive way is enough of an accomplishment for me.

I know I've been a source of joy, affection, and comfort to my BFF for decades, as she is for me. Ditto with my relationship with my mom when she was still alive. I cherish and take pleasure in the close relationships I have, both in the giving and the receiving.

I've also mentored numerous co-workers over the years. Helping someone else be successful is deeply satisfying to me. There is no feeling like the one I get when someone tells you they appreciate and benefited from knowledge you've passed along."
1787,"That I defied expectations from other people. That I stood up for myself after years of compromising.  That I, even though the future is uncertain, feel hopeful. That I know myself better than ever before."
1788,"Hmm, probably fighting through three really debilitating depressive episodes."
1789,"I'll let history be the judge of that. No point in me worrying about it. I've done a lot with my life that I am very happy about, so they can take their pick as to what they consider the greatest."
1790,Living the life I always wanted
1791,Getting my first book published in 2011
1792,One time in New Orleans a very polite gentleman told me I had ‚Äúthe best ass on Bourbon Street‚Äù. There were a lot of asses on Bourbon Street that night so I‚Äôm pretty proud of that.
1793,"Being able to understand other peoples emotions.
It seems small, but if you don't understand people's emotions you can't really have fulfilling relationships."
1794,"Being where I am today.  

Chose toxic friends in undergrad, got addicted to drugs, got kicked out of the house for 4 months, got back on my feet,  finished my bachelors in Kinesiology last year, got accepted into a private doctoral program and working my way to my doctorate degree as we speak. Oh, and my relationship with my parents has been mended and all is well.   

&#x200B;

Couldn't be more proud of myself honestly"
1795,Self acceptance and growth
1796,I have found the love of my life at a young age and raised a family in spite of initial difficulties.
1797,My son!
1798,My baby girl. She‚Äôs so pretty... I would be upset that I didn‚Äôt get to see her grow up and help her through her troubles. She‚Äôs not even a year old yet... so smart for her age too...
1799,My daughter.
1800,"God, I feel like that too. I was smart growing up, got a 31 on my ACT and a full ride in college...now I'm just an accountant at a small business and I don't feel like I'm doing anything meaningful with my life. I struggle with wanting to be more and also being lazy and content with what I do currently."
1801,Please tell more?!
1802,"yes! for me, too. at first there was the crushing failure, sure. but after that my god, am i so happy to never have to step into that portal to hell EVER AGAIN."
1803,Proud of you.
1804,I think our accomplishments only matter if *we* are proud of them as an individual.
1805,That's kind; thank you
1806,">I've done a lot with my life that I am very happy about, so they can take their pick as to what they consider the greatest."
1807,"Yeah, I was agreeing with you.."

1809,"most of my good male friends are my boyfriend‚Äôs friends. usually they just treat me like one of the guys, but around this time last year my boyfriend went on a work trip for about a week and i was having issues with my roommate so i stayed there for the week without him. his roommates/friends treated me totally different when he was abroad vs when he‚Äôs here. they were so flirtatious and tease-y towards me in a way they hadn‚Äôt been before then and hadn‚Äôt been since. i still love those guys but that experience did kind of reshape my relationship with them in my mind"
1810,"Demand that I explain to them the behavior of some random girl I don't know because they're mad. Like dude I have no idea why she doesn't want to flirt back with you, maybe she's not interested? It's as if they expect me to check the Female Hive Mind on demand because they're annoyed at a behavior."
1811,"They don‚Äôt listen to my advice when it comes to women they date, and it always blows up in their faces! I don‚Äôt understand asking me for help then doing the exact opposite of what I suggested, then acting surprised or hurt when it doesn‚Äôt work out for them. 

Also had one guy friend for decades, we‚Äôd known each other since elementary school and we were great friends, but every time I‚Äôd bring another guy around he‚Äôd start doing things like slapping my butt, putting his arm around me, or telling stories that only included us so the other guy would feel left out. He never did those things when it was just the two of us hanging out, so I knew it was an obvious play for male dominance. I stopped being friends with him for that reason, very toxic and immature."
1812,"It doesn't really happen as much with close male friends, but definitely apologizing for swearing in front of me. I swear all the time, and the apology, though probably well-intended, just makes me feel excluded because of my gender."
1813,Calling women ‚Äúbitches‚Äù and ‚Äúbroads‚Äù.
1814,Yelling
1815,"Picking me up. A lot of them will pick me up and spin me around when hugging me, or pick me up to move me out of the way instead of just telling me to move. Some of them stopped after I said I don't like it, but some of them just continue, knowing I'm not strong enough to stop them. 

I don't like it. I'm not a cat or a baby."
1816,"This might seem pretty small but it bothers me when guy friends do that thing where they put their hand on your back to sort of guide you or urge you to move in front of them. It has a boyfriend-y vibe to me but also I feel like I'm being treated differently because I'm a woman. Like I said, a pretty small thing, I know."
1817,"Tickling me! I hate it! My skin is super sensitive, I do squirm and can't stop the giggles. But when the squirms and giggles are accompanied by me yelling ""please stop, I don't like that!"" And me trying to get away and you take that as an invitation to restrain me and do it more..... well I can't really call you my friend after that."
1818,"Talk over me without even realizing, bc they're talking so loud they can't hear anything else."
1819,"Every time two of my girl friends were having a discussion, he would say ‚Äúgirls, girls, it‚Äôs ok! You‚Äôre both pretty!‚Äù

Called him out, but he still says shit like this"
1820,"Not much of my friends anymore due to this but here goes: 

Exclaim how much they don't like my body type (skinny/tall) in front of their gf to make em feel more secure. It's usually when I say something like "" I love this new dress I bought!"" Or if I'm just feeling generally more confident that day. It'll be met with ""I HATE flat chested women and like curvy women much better!"" Like yay that's great but what did I do again? Or ""Idk why dudes date you/are interested, you're not what dudes like."" (Like what does that even mean dude?)They'll almost always give a quick look at their gf to she if she's watching/approving. Which most times she is. (They are ex-friends too) It'll come unwarranted and outta the blue sometimes. Other times it'll come up when we're talking about body types/positivity then muting the point of the convo to begin with.

Granted this was only a handful of my male friends but it still sucks. You can tell her she's beautiful w/o shittin on me dude. (This can be applied with literally any physical/ personality trait that I have that they do not) Everyone is beautiful and different and that's fuckin dope, shittin on other people won't further your point. It just makes you an ass."
1821,Glancing at me when they make a sexist joke to see how I will react.
1822,"There was one guy (no longer friends, confirmed scumbag!) who used to comment on women constantly. I'm talking *real detailed* ""her face is all fucked up but her body is nice"", ""ugh she keeps flirting with me but she's disgusting, she has no ass"" etc. I don't remember how it started, but I think it escalated from innocent ""talking about people"" (I think her hair is really nice, I like his eyes, etc, etc.) to really malicious-feeling commentary. What made me uncomfortable wasn't so much talking about people, as *the way* he was talking about them. And he would do it *constantly*."
1823,Scratching their balls in the produce section.
1824,"""Falling in love"" with me and then acting like it's my fault."
1825,‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a women‚Äôs job‚Äù or other sexist jokes. Hey guess what? It‚Äôs actually STILL not funny.
1826,not listen to me when im talking to them
1827,"Talk about women (our mutual friends, colleagues from uni, random hook-ups) as if their worth resided solely in how much of a 'conquest' they are. They're good guys, overall, else I wouldn't be friends with them, but it's pretty uncomfortable to think they may value my gender (and thus, me) only in terms of sexual desirability."
1828,Being my friends in hopes that I will date/have sex with them. I have had plenty of male friends who have done this and very few who haven‚Äôt treated me like a sexual object.
1829,"Asking about my female friends/relatives like they're dating options. 

One of my SO's friends asked me about a friend like that soon as she walked away. Same guy asks about my sister every time he comes around, or if her name comes up in conversation. Always wants to know if she's still happy in her relationship. Ugh."
1830,"Immediately refuting me when I mention doing something for my health- working out or eating more, specifically. ""But you're already so pretty/skinny/ect..."" I don't tell them to stop when they mention their hobbies. What the hell is that about? It's my body, I know it best."
1831,"Demanding to know why I say or dont agree to certain discussions. Try to talk to me as if I'm a kid to do something. Not respecting the do not touch and ask for my permission.

At this point, I find the word I'm sorry as annoying when I look pissed."
1832,"Not listening when I tell them certain things they say offend me - calling things gay, saying fag, calling me a slut, saying women are the worst etc"
1833,"I guess the one thing that bothers me is feeling like I'm not really included at times. My friends are my boyfriend's friends, and sometimes I feel like they see me more as their friend's girlfriend instead of their friend, despite knowing them for like 5 years. Like if one of them asks/says something regarding both of us they'll usually just ask him.

I get that they have known him a looooot longer though and maybe this is one of the reasons that I need to get a few female friends."
1834,"Using ""we're friends so it's fine"" as an excuse for stuff I am not comfortable with and ignoring when I say I'm uncomfortable.

Talking about my appearance, complimenting me, drinking alone together late at night, talking about *my relationship with my partner.* Asking to stay in *my bed* because I don't have a place for guests and *did not invite him over.* But it's fine, cuz we're friends right?

Some of these, lots of people are fine with. I'm not. And when I say I'm uncomfortable and don't like it, it should stop and nobody should be surprised if I walk out when it continues."
1835,"I don't have a lot of guy friends. My best friend is a guy. And I can count on one hand how many other guys I'm friends with. And because of that, whenever I meet a guy who has the potential of being a friend, I go out of my way to be nice to them or talk to them quite a bit. A lot of them end up thinking I'm hitting on them. That annoys me and makes me uncomfortable. I really wish men in general would stop reading into women's actions more than they would read into their male friends' actions."
1836,They ask me to make them sandwiches.
1837,"Jokingly slap my ass and touch me? I had one squeeze my thigh last year but I gave him a good beating for it. I love my friends but lets not, good thing they don't anymore but oh boy..."
1838,"When my ex-husband and I separated, I experienced a big shift in behavior. Asking for nudes, talking about persuing me even though I said no. One said he was still going to try anyway. And when they don't get what they are looking for, they just kind of disappear.

Apparently I'm only interesting and worth talking to if they want something out of it. Kind of sucks to know that's how your seen."
1839,They try to pick me up when they hug me.
1840,One of my friends makes an excuse to try to touch my boobs every time I see him. Me telling him to fuck off makes no difference. His excuse is ‚Äúbut I‚Äôve never touched implants before‚Äù. So fucking what?! I‚Äôve had to limit my interactions with him.
1841,Rape jokes. It's never funny.
1842,"It makes me uncomfortable when my male friends comment on or discuss a woman's body or body type. I feel like there's a difference between acknowledging someone's beauty, but some go too far. 

I've been told this is a double standard. However when I comment about a guy I usually say something like ""wow that guy is cute/attractive/gorgeous""; I'm not sexualizing him. I feel like that's not the case with most men."
1843,"Calling me beautiful or gorgeous while I‚Äôm in a relationship even when I ask them to stop. And I don‚Äôt mean just saying ‚Äúomg you look beautiful/gorgeous/cute in that outfit‚Äù, that‚Äôs okay. I mean when they say, ‚Äúhey beautiful‚Äù or ‚Äúhey gorgeous‚Äù as if it‚Äôs a pet name. It‚Äôs petty, I know, but I feel like that‚Äôs something that should be reserved for a significant other."
1844,"Make me the butt of every joke. There‚Äôs playful teasing among friends, but then there‚Äôs crossing a line. Makes me feel like they really feel that way about me when they‚Äôre joking."
1845,"When my ex and I broke up, his best friend started trying to harass me into some kind of sub/dom relationship. He sent me a ton of messages about ""owning my orgasm"". It was incredibly creepy AF, not okay, and he would not stop despite me telling him this. 

I ended up in sending the messages to my ex, who put a stop to it right away. IDK if they are still friends or not, but I hope for my exes sake he never spoke to the guy again."
1846,"acting as if im not understanding them every time i disagree. dude i get it, im not 5, let me talk ffs"
1847,"Try to get my 'female stamp of approval' to discredit the way some other woman in their lives is behaving. Sometimes there is a situation where they feel that they have been accused or may be accused of being/having an opinion which is misogynistic, and they want me to validate their beliefs/actions. In the spirit of ""I have a black/gay/\[minority\] friend who thinks \[x\] too!""

I don't play those games."
1848,Talk about women (in general) in a disrespectful manner.
1849,"Pretty much every guy I've been friends with has tried to sleep with me, so I really wish they would stop doing that."
1850,"I don‚Äôt want to be too specific because this was recent and idk if any of them would see this. We all game pretty often but there‚Äôs a few times when they‚Äôve just gone too far with sexual jokes or asking me messed up questions along those lines. Sometimes I wish they would stop doing stuff like that cuz it kinda hurts knowing first and foremost they see me in a sexual way instead of just being ‚Äúone of the guys‚Äù. One joke here or there won‚Äôt bother me as much I guess but once you start digging at it and continuing it‚Äôs just pretty messed up. Not all of them are like that tho and a few do say that hey that‚Äôs too far man but damn. I didn‚Äôt come here for that, you know? There‚Äôs also the women‚Äôs rights jokes and stuff but that isn‚Äôt as bad"
1851,"""Where's my hug?"""
1852,"I had my very good guy friend over about 3 weeks ago to just hang out and catch up since getting back from college (before social distancing was a thing). For context, he knows I have a bf and has known that I do not like him romantically in any way. We were watching a movie, sitting on opposite sides of the couch, and I fell asleep. I woke up to him rubbing my legs and steadily creeping higher. I was very uncomfortable and told him to leave. He has a habit of doing things like that while I‚Äôm sleeping and I wish he would stop because he never does anything like that when we‚Äôre hanging out and I‚Äôm awake."
1853,"Complain about random stuff and then get upset when I don't try to make them feel better or sympathize with the issue. Like dude, your other friends don't give a shit either, why should I?"
1854,Ask me to find them someone when they're single. Like no dude I don't do that you know I don't do that. Get too close. Like yes I hug and get closer to my girl friends you are not a girl friend you are a man back up. (And this is a clearly set boundary that everyone is well aware of it's not just a mistake)
1855,"Using the word ""rape"" when gaming. It immediately ruins the fun when someone starts saying/yelling ""RAPE HIM, RAPE HIM!!"" etc. over and over again when you're just trying to fight something, anything. I know, it's an unfortunately common term used in gaming and I've met people who genuinely seem to think it just means beating someone in a fight.. but still. Educate yourself on the real meaning, please."
1856,"If we're talking, they get progressively closer to my face and I slowly have to move away"
1857,Expect a parade for doing the dishes/laundry/litter-boxes/dinner/what-have-you once.
1858,"Love-bombing, I only have a few male friends and all of them do this. It's so painfully obvious they do it because they like me more than a friend so I keep communication with them to a minimum."
1859,"Virtually always mistaking me being a decent human to them as me flirting with them. 99% of the time they are wrong because I""m not flirting."
1860,"Commenting on my looks before personality. You're my friend, that means I will in fact not be showing you my boobs"
1861,"I wish they‚Äôd stop thinking they know more about girls than I do just because I‚Äôm ‚Äúone of the guys‚Äù. I‚Äôll listen to them whine and complain about why a girl won‚Äôt be with them, but they refuse to listen to my advice about taking a hint and moving on when the girl says she isn‚Äôt interested. Instead they cry about why girls don‚Äôt like video games, anime, and nice guys who only want to treat them right."
1862,"Only talking to me when they are single. I had a good guy friend who is always an awesome buddy even when I'm in a relationship. But as soon as he gets into one, he's literally out of my life forever. Ridiculous!"
1863,"This seems petty reading other responses, but it always drives me crazy when men fuck up my hair. I redid my bun/braid/ponytail 7 times in the mirror before I got it how I wanted and then a male friend will scruff it up, pull on it, pet it. They mostly seem to think it‚Äôs funny? I guess? I think I just hate having my hair touched lol."
1864,"I'm not friends with this person anymore, but a few years ago I was still friends with an ex because, while we weren't good for each other dating, he was still a really close friend that I liked talking to and hanging out with. Until he started disrespecting my relationship with someone I had started seeing. He would come by my house when he was coming through town, which was normal, but he started treating me more like his property and a piece of meat instead of a human being (picking me up for no reason, wrapping his arms around me if we were walking, telling me to pull the top of my shirts down so he could ""investigate"", etc.) üôÑ"
1865,"Asking me to explain why women care so much about their bodies and appearance.  Basically trying to make it seem like women are foolish to care about this stuff

They will ask me why girls spend so much time working on their butts in the gym for instance.  Ummm.  its because as soon as you guys leave the gym you are going to talk about how nice the asses of the girls in there are."
1866,I despise it when a man  think he is complimenting you or thinks he doing some good by telling you to stop doing this stop doing that. If I‚Äôm going to be honest I find it demeaning and controlling.
1867,Making sexist jokes constantly and not accepting a no
1868,"One of my guy friends has a tendency to sometimes call women,‚Äùbroads‚Äù. And when this one woman walked by with a bodycon dress he basically said,‚Äùname the price‚Äù. Probably shouldn‚Äôt be friends with him."
1869,nothing or they wouldn't be my friends
1870,"I have a straight male friend who gives me a pretty long hug (like 5 seconds) multiple times every time we see each other, and he does it in a way where it feels like he‚Äôs thrusting his crotch into my thigh. It‚Äôs really uncomfortable, especially since I‚Äôm not a very touchy person."
1871,"Shutting me out of conversations because its ‚Äúguy talk.‚Äù If you wanted to have ‚Äúguy talk‚Äù you shouldn‚Äôt have invited me, you could just talk about that shit somewhere else. Plus the fact that anything has to be just ‚Äúguy talk‚Äù is sus to me"
1872,"They like to jump scare me whenever they see me, and they really need to stop because one of these days I‚Äôm going cry."
1873,"I dont consider him a friend anymore, but this guy that used to walk to lunch with me (I'm a senior in highschool) would always talk about some hentai or porn he had watched. I had never expressed any interest in hearing that, and once he found out that I liked to draw he started making jokes about me drawing ""anime girls with big boobs"" as he put it. He even said that in front of my little brother!! I was mortified. I eventually found out he had a crush on me which made this even worse, if he was constantly thinking about that shit then what the hell was he thinking about me??? Gross :/"
1874,"Making inappropriate sexual comments or saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you fall in love with me‚Äù when I‚Äôve made it clear that we are just friends. I respond to these situations either by shutting him down, immediately changing the subject, or just not responding at all. I don‚Äôt understand how the message has not been received."
1875,"My best friend is a single male who is desperately looking after women constantly. He tells me very intimate details about how he will get ready for dates (detailed describtion of how he shaved his balls etc), and is always asking for advice on how to approach and flirt with women.

I am not always comfortable knowing these details, and would rather have him find a good male friend to share these things with."
1876,These comments seem like a lot of these ‚Äúguy friends‚Äù are extremely immature and toxic. I feel like normal guy-girl relationships are not typically like this during and after college but I‚Äôm just speaking from experience.
1877,I have a male friend who messages me really late at night. Nothing inappropriate but I can text him 8am and he'll  message me back 9pm or later.  He works night shift so I guess it makes sense but I still don't want my husband to think anything
1878,"When a friend hears shitty misogynistic stuff from someone else, much like the stuff people are talking about here, and don't call them out for it. Like I don't care how much of a gentleman you are on your own, it means more if you try to make better people out of men around you. If if say anything, its in one ear and out the other. It would be great if they called out their bs and stood up for their values"
1879,Make sexual comments or slap my ass/touch me in anyway I‚Äôm not comfortable with because we‚Äôre ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and then when I voice this in an understandably angry way say they were just joking and act like I‚Äôm overreacting
1880,"Distancing themselves socially when they get a girlfriend. I‚Äôve noticed a pattern when my guy friends start dating their SO‚Äôs. We‚Äôll all hang out as a group and they‚Äôll bring their girlfriend over, but my guy friends won‚Äôt talk or interact with me as much."
1881,"Well, these are all behaviors of former male friends but here‚Äôs my list...using the c word, telling jokes/stories that clearly make me uncomfortable and then making a point of telling the joke/story again to get a reaction, hitting on me when I have already shown I‚Äôm not interested, picking me up when hugging me, and trying to get me to sit on their lap."
1882,"i dont have a lot of male friends, but whenever I hang out with one of them, he always stares at my chest area and it really makes me uncomfortable. im not sure if he realizes he's doing it or not, and I honestly don't think there's anything to it, but I just feel weird"
1883,[removed]
1884,"Swearing a lot in front of me like they would in front of their male friends, knowing that i don't swear or barely"
1885,Calls me cutie and sends me dick pics that I really don‚Äôt want but I don‚Äôt wanna be rude
1886,Just bc we‚Äôre not romantic doesn‚Äôt give them an excuse to not be gentlemen at all times
1887,"This is what bothers me the most. You think they‚Äôre your friends, then when opportunity strikes it all changes. It goes back to normal when the opportunity goes away, but you can‚Äôt see them the same way anymore, even if you try. Are they your friends, really deep down??"
1888,[removed]
1889,"Yes. I hate when it's worded as ""why are you girls like this"" like it's my fault too?"
1890,"I'm sorry that's frustrating, but ""the Female Hive Mind"" is one of the funniest things I've ever read. I'm picturing a female Borg Collective now."
1891,"I hate when they do this, I give them some pretty solid advice, and then they proceed to NOT LISTEN TO ME."
1892,"I hate this too! My guy friends will come to me for advice, and I give them great advice...then they do something totally different. And surprise, it doesn't work out and then I have to listen to them whine again about the girl.

I remember I broke up with my ex, and he went to my best friend for advice (we're all in the same friend group). She gave him advice that definitely would've worked to get me back, yet he completely ignored it! When she told me about it I was so shocked, like how can you totally ignore advice from the girl's best friend?? lol"
1893,Females
1894,"Dames, females, chicks üôÑ"
1895,Amen
1896,"Freaking me. People don‚Äôt really pick me up anymore but new people always ask me if they can hold me or pick me up. What the crap? I‚Äôm just a small girl! I‚Äôm not rare, people can be short and you honestly don‚Äôt have to pick me up. They also never know what they‚Äôre doing so they just grab me under the arms and lift as forcefully as they can which hurts."
1897,I'm too big for men to do it to me easily so it's very rare but when it does my first reaction to unwanted touching is to go for the face in any way I can. It's always hilarious because they act like they are the victim once they let go of me like uh you touched me without permission of course I reacted.
1898,Knee them right in the crotch next time.
1899,"Completely agree! You don't have to downplay it by calling it a small thing. It IS a very annoying and uncomfortable thing, and they sure as hell wouldn't do it to their guy friends."
1900,"Acceptable times to touch me: 

1- high five 

2- a hug we‚Äôre both aware of (do not hug me from behind please) 

3- emergency situations 

I used to be okay with lots of different types of casual friendly touching but then one of my guy friends ruined it and now I maintain much stricter personal boundaries. :/"

1902,"My family‚Äôs rule was always that ‚ÄúTickling is the only hittable offense‚Äù (i.e., we were never allowed to hit each other, UNLESS someone was being tickled against their will). If my brother started tickling me and didn‚Äôt stop when I asked, I was allowed to smack him, no questions asked, and vice versa.

The only time I can remember this backfiring was when my sister was dating her now-husband when they were in college, and he tried to tickle her. She lashed out reflexively and almost broke his nose! But, you know, they still got married, so I guess it didn‚Äôt backfire too badly."
1903,"My guy asked if I like being tickled before he ever touched me.
My auto response was, ""f*ck no!""
I hate it so much. I've punched and kneed exes in the face just by reflex when they tickled me despite me screaming to stop."
1904,"Or when what you say doesn't register with them, but then they repeat back almost exactly what you said like it was their own observation."

1910,These people are not your friends. And their girlfriends who hear this happening and *agree* are insecure and willfully blind to the blatant bullying at your expense.
1911,"Oh my god. I've been with guys like this. the first guy I tolerated it because it wasnt in front of my friends and mostly I was just confused? I didnt get that he was trying to reassure whatever insecurities he had imagined for me. It was like, shit, okay, he really doesn't like that friend of mine. Alright I'll stop having you two at the same meet ups or whatever. In retrospect, I understand now what it was. 

Guys who do this to me now? One of he quickest ways to lose my interest and/or get dumped depending on how far along we are. They are my friends! You are shit talking my friends! The people I care and love about! How did you think this was gonna go?!?"

1916,Dude! This! One of my ex male friends does this but I was included in their side commentary. It sucks big time. I definitely get it.
1917,I went on two dates with a guy like this. I now believe based on this and other behaviors he was a classic sociopath.
1918,This is all of my male coworkers
1919,"I experience almost the same thing. I'm in a group project for school where I'm the only female and there are 4 males. We got on well, regularly hang out outside of class together and now I just consider them as my group of friends from this class. One time, we were hanging out and a girl passed by our table, they started discussing how her ass looked great and how they wanted to jerk off to it. I was immediately disgusted but little did I know that was only the start of things. As we hang out more, they started talking more deeply about girls, sometimes asking for my input if this one looks fuckable. They seemed like nice guys the first few times we hang out as a group, besides this disgusting commentary behavior, they weren't really immature in any way. I told my bf this and he said that's just how teenage boys are, they will grow up and stop discussing those things, especially not in front of another female. I really hope they do."
1920,Ugh anything involving hands down pants should DEFINITELY only happen in private
1921,I have seen SO MANY men shove their hands down their pants to scratch their crotch. I just can‚Äôt deal with it.
1922,Yeah those aren't good friends
1923,"I came here to say this! First words my male friends say when they even HEAR me mention one of my girlfriends are ""Is she single?"".  Unfortunately for them, I know wayyy too much about how they behave in relationships to even suggest to one of my friends about getting romantically involved. Love you but no.. haha!"
1924,"I know what you mean! They don‚Äôt even try to hide it at times. Or you‚Äôre going out with your s/o and some of his guy friends, and they ask if you can bring along some of your single girlfriends for them. 

Like first of all... No. I‚Äôve seen how you act around/treat the girls you‚Äôre with. And second of all, I‚Äôm not your personal dating app! You want to talk to someone, YOU make the effort."
1925,I had this issue with the word thot when it was a thing a few years ago. All my guy friends started calling me thot as a joke and couldn‚Äôt understand why I found it insulting and demeaning.
1926,"It kinda seems like they don't expect your relationship to last. Like they're not investing in you because they don't think you'll be around much longer. They're not on your side, they don't care about your side.  Get some friends who will be on your side."
1927,[removed]
1928,Absolutely disgusting behavior.
1929,[removed]
1930,That is not your friend.
1931,"Wtf, that guy has a problem. I would also limit my interactions with him or just dont have any interactions with him at all. If he does that to you he does that with more people"
1932,You still hang out with this asshole????
1933,"that is not a friend. Block him, humiliate him in public, do anything you can to get rid of this guy from your life."

1938,You should start calling them some ridiculous pet name  right back to show them how weird they sound. Hey Mr Snuggle Butt!!!
1939,It's so cringey and gross!
1940,"went through some messed up shit with a childhood friend of my ex, but during the relationship. dude was almost completely cut off of his life. then he seemed to regret it and i tried to forgive him - didn't work, he did the same thing again. my ex is back at hanging out with him since the breakup and my forgiveness (we were all in the same school), and doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon, even after the last thing that dude did to me or other girls online. 

good to see your ex didn't cut contact with him just because he was a ""threat"" or something..."
1941,[removed]
1942,He is not your friend.
1943,Please don't be friends with this guy. He sounds like someone who would rape you if you were to pass out drunk. Definitely shouldn't be someone that can be trusted
1944,Please please please reconsider ever seeing this guy again. Imagine what might happen if you didn't wake up in time.
1945,Mmmmm... He has a habit ?! I mean... Thats very creepy and I would say you should avoid him. Bit if you say he is a good friend try talking about this. Like he stops that or you stop seeing him
1946,[removed]
1947,I mean... If you think It could lead to some trouble you should talk to one of them. The one who would understand It better maybe? I would say It should be your husband and make him know he is just a friend. Hope everything turns out fine :)
1948,[removed]
1949,Isn‚Äôt that what your would prefer though? Not being treated any differently because of your gender?
1950,"I have one friend who I've known for 7 years, and he had always been lowkey flirty and we'd had a few small discussions about it in the past, where I tried to clarify our boundaries. But on his birthday last year, he got completely wasted and started talking about how he still appreciated my friendship ""even though"" I ""still"" wouldn't hook up with him. 7 years later, really? This is still where we are???

I got incredibly upset. I just felt... dirty, like I was some item he'd just been waiting years for a chance to use. A few days later I blew up at him, was crying and everything. He was super apologetic, and admitted that the way he had perceived our friendship was disrespectful. Since then he's recognized that he has the same weird complex with lots of his other female friends and has been actively trying to dismantle them. So I guess some guys can come back from that, but I honestly don't think most can lol."

Sometimes my tampon string gets in a very uncomfortable position. Sometimes my blood on my pad gets stuck t my pubic hair and then dried blood pulls painfully on my pubic hair.

2021,"Well i just answered OP's question. Nobody is perfect, starting by me, so I expect nobody to change themselves to meet my needs or to be aware of what kind of behavior I like. I also don't mind light swearing from time to time, and I'd be happy to know that guys are comfy enough with me to stay true to themselves, but sometimes having no boundaries when it come to the vocabulary is not very appropriate..."

2023,"It was fun while it lasted. I liked my freedom. Most of the guys were respectful and if they weren't I got rid of them. You tend to grow out of it as you get older. I got it out of my system, but I'll tell you I regret the long term relationships I had in my twenties far more than any of the casual sexual ones."
2024,"It's great! I like enjoying a life with no commitments. Easier to breathe and I prefer my independence/singledom to being in a relationship, but I also like sex, so it is what it is. 

I don't think you need to be concerned about your friends being ""truly happy"". Not everyone needs a connection to have sex or wants a relationship. It's really not your place or your business."
2025,Felt great! It was a fun few years and I had a blast. As long as the dude wore a condom I never felt unsafe. Not everyone requires an emotional connection to have a good time.
2026,I've had a lot of fwb in my life and I don't regret any of them. They were fulfilling relationships in their own ways.
2027,It was fun. I recently made the decision I‚Äôm ready to settle down and that‚Äôs been unpleasant to say the least because I don‚Äôt know how to date
2028,"Are you truly happy in the job that you're slaving away in because you have an excessive amount of student loans? Sure you saaaay you love your boss, but we all know deep down you're unhappy.

Example aside, if a person says they're happy in a lifestyle. Believe them. I had a period of one night stands and friends with benefits. I also had other stuff going on. I was working a job I loved. I was working on self development. I was fit. Sex was just one aspect of my life, not the entire part of it. And now I'm in a domestic partnership. But it's not better or worse than my other life, it's just different and more conducive to my future goals."
2029,"If I ever get divorced I plan on sleeping around, a lot. Before I met my husband I was too worried what people might think of me if I had too many partners, and I actually chose to be celibate for years. That was dumb!"
2030,"As long as it‚Äôs between two consenting adults, whether it‚Äôs one night stands, FWBs, or even open relationships, they‚Äôre fine. My personal thinking is as long as everyone involved knows what it is and are being safe, it‚Äôs perfectly fine. It‚Äôs more about a person‚Äôs individual beliefs and morals around sex and as long as the two conditions I mentioned are met, I think sex and just be sex."
2031,"Fun for a bit, then kinda boring"
2032,"I lived this life for a good 4 years or so in my early 20's! It was really fun, I honestly loved it. I wasn't being a dumbass, though. I made sure that we used protection (yes, I had my own condom selection that I owned!), I was on birth control, I obviously got to know people before hooking up with them (at least a week chatting on a dating app, and at least 1-2 dates before sex), told my friends the address I'd be at if I was going over somewhere (I'd record the street address and apartment number mentally or take sneaky pics of it on my phone then send it to my most trusted friend), didn't have sex with a guy if there were any red flags in terms of personality and values, etc.

I did not want to necessarily invest a lot of time, mental energy, emotion, etc. into dating one person seriously. I also wanted to discover personality types, habits, and various other things that I personally prefer in the people I will date in the future. Because I took time to get to know the guys and weed out the gross ones before I met any, I met a lot of really kind, respectful, and sweet guys!! I really enjoyed it and really learned a lot about what I like and don't like. I had mostly a string of FWB's, not one night stands. That's because I cultivated those friendships over time with people who I clicked with, and those lasted anywhere from a few months to 2 years or so. They were mostly sexually exclusive, but sometimes not, and I was always smart about my sexual health.

I never really felt uncomfortable or confused. I had full control over my behavior at all times, so if I wanted to, I could easily postpone meeting someone or just say that I'm no longer interested in seeing someone with a genuine reason.

It's just a series of memories that I have mentally stored away in one tiny book in my brain, if that makes sense. I'm done with that lifestyle now, but I feel it was extremely valuable for my personal development, in terms of my communication skills, reading people and picking up on red flags, what makes me happy, etc. And, getting it out of my system."
2033,"It's exciting for a bit, but truth be told sex is way better in a committed relationship."
2034,"I tried dating again after getting out of a relationship and realized I wasn‚Äôt ready and I was still hurting from it. Instead I just ‚Äúcasually‚Äù dated and only had sex with the ones I was comfortable with. It was always protected so I wasn‚Äôt worried about that. I liked not having commitment honestly. I felt mentally drained and definitively not ready to give 100% to someone because I needed to focus on myself. I think the best part about it was meeting and talking to new people. 
I had a fwb type of relationship too but in my experience it wasn‚Äôt worth ruining a previous or potential friendship."
2035,"It was fun for a year or two, but then I started getting really jaded. Maintaining FWB relationships and having one night stands from dating apps started to feel too routine and chore-like, and I realized I wasn‚Äôt really getting much pleasure out of my hookups anymore. I was mainly just doing it to please the guy to boost my own self-esteem. I grew out of that though, and now I‚Äôm blissfully single with no guys in my life :)"
2036,I had 1 FWB and he was great. We are both still friends now.
2037,[removed]
2038,I had one serious relationship in college and after it ended I was like ‚ÄúI wasted a valuable year on you!‚Äù
2039,"It's really not my business. But I'm interested in the psychology and social implications behind casual relationships. If it's so great maybe I should give it a go, just saying."
2040,This basically is my feeling about it too. I don‚Äôt understand why the baseline assumption of most people is that emotional connection must be involved for it to be ‚Äúsafe‚Äù!
2041,"I plan to sleep around for a while too if I ever break up with my long term boyfriend! I've never had the time and never wanted to invest in casual relationships. But it does sound fun and different, and I'd like to try that kind of lifestyle for a bit if I get a chance."
2042,Why did it get boring? I've only heard positive and fun things regarding the social aspect of casual relationships.

2049,Couldn't. Cut it to shoulder length- problem solved
2050,"* Silk pillowcase
* Weekly olaplex no.3 mask
* kerastase nourishing mask instead of conditioner
* loose side braid in bed sometimes
* regular trims
* do not blow dry.  

I'm going to try a spray hair oil just for the ends - I've heard that a quick spray just before bed every night helps."
2051,I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm about 5 seconds from shaving my head again.
2052,Braid it so it's never down alone.
2053,"I've found that consistently using leave-in conditioner has made a big difference. Also, I also use a Wet Brush now and it goes right through tangles without hurting!"
2054,"Wear it up in a twist, bun, or in braids."
2055,"Spray-in conditioner in addition to what's used in the shower, braids, wrapping my hair in a scarf or tucking my hair into a beanie if I'm going someplace windy."
2056,"I've found that consistently using leave-in conditioner has made a big difference. Also, I also use a Wet Brush now and it goes right through tangles without hurting!"
2057,"I deep condition and blow dry and straighten my hair . If I let it dry naturally or skip the straighteners it gets tangled much easier , something about straightening it makes it smoother n less likely to tangle . Damaging tho :("
2058,Keep my hair in braids most of the time.
2059,Leave in conditioner. Keep the split ends cut.
2060,I finally caved and got dreads lol
2061,I don‚Äôt bother trying. It‚Äôll get tangled regardless-I just have to man handle it into submission every time I brush it. Curly hair can suck sometimes.
2062,"I brush it while it‚Äôs wet, I use a leave-in conditioner on my ends, and when i go to sleep I braid it."
2063,I used to put my hair in braids whenever I was home. Now I don't do that. I make sure to de-tangle my hair every time I wash my hair to make sure my hair doesn't get SUPER knotty.
2064,"Really the only solution is to cut it to a manageable length. Even if you find certain styles help, once you wash it you have a big mess again. Cut it to a manageable length and you're good to go."
2065,Pony tail
2066,I use a leave-in detangler and comb (NOT brush!) my hair when it‚Äôs wet. Sometimes it‚Äôs still inevitable though and I‚Äôll just toss it up in a bun.
2067,Spray-in leave-in conditioner and brushing it right before bed.
2068,I chopped it all off! I had the most heavy fine hair that was always knotted and weighed down. Cut it to my chin and never looked back.
2069,"I have to keep mines braided or twisted, and also moisturized to avoid it."
2070,"When I was a kid I used to braid my hair before I went to sleep. Now I just brush it and put in argan oil before I go out. otherwise, I just let it rage (I've been doing this basically all the time since in quarantine)"
2071,Brush it very frequently. I have mini brushes in all my bags.
2072,"Haha, me too üòÖ"
2073,My tangles are so bad my Wet Brush is useless :(
2074,"Yuck! I have generally straight or a slight natural beach wave, and my hair is bad. I can‚Äôt imagine having having curly hair!"
2075,"When I was 16, I needed to go to the ER and for some reason no one managed to properly hit a vein. Took like 30+ attempts for them to connect the NaCl IV. Then my vein burst, the NaCl just filled up the tissue in my elbow and they gave up.

A day after, there was a really cute doctor. Riiiight out of university, if even that. He placed a venous access on the first try, so I told him he's really good at this. In my language however, that came out really wrong as I'd used a synonym for fucking, when I was just trying to compliment his skill. (""Stechen kannst du echt gut!"")

He was horrified at first, but then luckily just chuckled. I wanted to die then and there."
2076,"after having pelvic pain for many months in a row, i went in to have my IUD removed. it had only been in place for a year and some change. the doctor told me i was wasting it. i went to a new doctor after that."
2077,"I think my first appointment about the symptoms diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis will stick in my mind. It was more than 2 decades ago and a lot of the little, every-day (well, every-appointment) details were lost.

This appointment was with our family doctor, an older man. Before the joint pain set in I was a healthy kid, so I hadn't seen him much (the regular pediatric appointments had stopped some time previously and were a different doc). My dad didn't like our doc, said he couldn't figure anything out, so I was worried going in. Also, as a 16 year old girl, I expected to be ignored, treated as an ignorant child. My pain was severe. I could barely walk. I couldn't properly chew food anymore. I couldn't lift my hands above my head or grip with any strength. I had a trigger finger. I was worse off than my grandfather, who was in his 80s. But I expected the doc to think I was making it all up.

Instead he listened with kindness and empathy. When I described what things were like for me, he believed me. He looked at my joints, touched gently, and spoke to me primarily (Mom was there with me, but the doc treated me as the person he was talking to and my mom as ""another person in the conversation"". I'd expected him to talk to my mom primarily and kinda gloss over things with ""the child""). 

After listening carefully, asking good questions, examining me, etc., he said that he thought it was likely to be either rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, more likely to be RA. He has a specialist he'd like to send me to for the conclusive diagnosis. If we'd like to go that direction we should tell him now; there's a waiting list, but this is severe, and he may be able to get us an appointment earlier if he calls up the rheumatologist. We agreed.

As I finished giving a urine sample I saw my doc on his phone. From what I could tell, he was talking to the rheumatologist, getting me an appointment. There was a 2 month waiting list, but I had an appointment 3 days later. Both our family doctor and the rheumatologist said this was an ""emergency"" case. RA can attack the heart and lungs (actually the membranes around each) and potentially cause life threatening symptoms. It's rare, but my case progressed fast and was showing signs of being that sort of case.

I will always remember the first time a doctor treated me like I could know something. I will also always remember what it was like hearing this diagnosis that I will (probably) live with for the rest of my life."
2078,"I'll go with positive memorable. I once went to the doctor when I was just about to finish high school because my ear hurt. The doctor started to make some chitchat and asked me what I was doing in school at the moment and I told him I was writing my thesis about antibiotics. He got really interested and wanted me to tell him what I had so far, then he asked me what my plans for the future were. I said I wanted to study biology and he gave me some advice about that and some numbers of people I should call. In total we spent like 30 minutes just chatting because at that point he hadn't even looked at my ear yet."
2079,"If this is looking for porn, I only have trauma."
2080,Does a phlebotomist count? Creep used his fucking boner to keep my arm in place during a butterfly stick. I \*still\* regret not reporting him 14 years later.
2081,"I was diagnosed with PTSD by my doctor after I went to him to ask for something to make the invasive thoughts/images/memories in my head stop. He referred me to a local psychiatrist.

Before my first appointment a psych nurse on staff was supposed to help me get a prescription for some meds. I'm sitting there in her office, she's asking me some questions, can see my diagnosis on her charts, and she's asking me about symptoms etc.

She told me I didn't need meds or therapy, I just needed to grow up. Apparently the reason I kept invasively and viscerally reliving my rape all day every day or spending huge chunks of my day completely dissociated and blacked out was because I just needed to ""grow up and get over it"". Just like that. Just flip a switch and grow up.

She still prescribed me the medication and I started group therapy with an amazing psychiatrist and one on one with a psychologist in her staff. But that nurse really pissed me off."
2082,"Memorable in a bad way: my OBGYN (who graduated from Harvard) totally dismissed my concerns about endometriosis and told me that horrible period pain is just 'normal.' She then went on to ask if I wanted children, and when I said no, she LAUGHED and asked what my husband thought of that. I do not go to her anymore and she has since became the lead doctor on the board of directors at our local women's pregnancy crisis center (anti-abortion). 

Memorable in a good way: When I was a teenager, I fell out of a moving car and my whole body was covered in scrapes, bruises, and road rash. Some wounds were so deep it was almost to the bone. When I got the the ER, a nurse took me back immediately because she could tell I was in so much pain. She put me in a wheelchair and cleaned out all my wounds with a cloth. She was so gentle and caring and I could feel her concern and I just appreciated that so much."
2083,"My first semester in college, I caught a bad cold. I thought it was a sinus infection, so I went to the student health center to make an appointment with the doctor. The receptionist was rude to me, so I went back to my car and cried. The next day, the doctor was able to see me. When she came in, she gave me a hug, which I really needed. I will always appreciate that."
2084,"The first time I experienced major depression and anxiety and really thought I was going to end up committing suicide or being sectioned under the mental health act I was given an appointment with another doctor by chance and it ended up being a blessing in disguise.  

He had a special interest in depression as he had suffered from it his whole life.  Rather than a ten minute appointment and a prescription for pills he actually spent time listening and treating me.  Every week I had an hour or more with him and he just understood.  It was like spending time chatting with a wiser older family member.  

I eventually recovered.  He was a great doctor but he had to retire early as his own mental health took another turn."
2085,I was getting a depo shot and the nurse injected it into my butt and couldnt get the liquid in so she pushed. The vial ended up exploding with the needle still in my butt and it sprayed both of us leaving white marks all over my shoes and jeans and she got it on her face ü§£. I had to get two shots that day
2086,"During the ultrasound when I was pregnant and she told us we were having twins. I‚Äôve never been so shocked (in a good way, of course!) in my life. Surreal but amazing moment that I‚Äôll never forget."
2087,"I finally made a PCP appointment after years and years. I didn't want to - Doctor's make me nervous, I'm pretty healthy, and the healthcare system is a pain in the ass. Eventually after months and months I got an appointment. The nurse who took my height and weight before I saw him told me ""he's the best"" and she was right.

He was a bit older and he was just the kindest, most thoughtful and knowledgable doctor I have ever had. He listened to me explain my illnesses, what worked for me. I have a long history of mental illness but he did not dismiss me or my concerns because of my history of mental illness. After it was over he even complimented me on how well I handle my mental illness and how well I express myself. I could not recommend him enough. He was seriously excellent and made me encourage everyone else to go to him as a doctor."
2088,"Three years ago, when my dad was in the ER because of a heart attack which he needed a triple bypass for, I visited and the nurse saw how distraught I was. I tried holding in the tears but they kept flowing (I was told my dad barely survived).

The nurse came and looked at my dad and said to him, in front of me, ""do you want to walk her down the aisle one day?"". He started bawling- I've never seen him cry before in my life. I remember this woman like it was yesterday. This helped him fight harder and helped make me more positive throughout the nightmare of a time. Knowing that, if we fight to be stronger there will be better days ahead and that he has to watch his health in order for this to happen.

We both smiled after crying and felt the dark cloud lift a tiny bit, knowing we were given another chance to make many more great memories."
2089,"I saw a different GP at my local clinic one time and she asked me if I had any previous injuries. I told her I once broke my hip. She asked ""was it from sex??"" and started joking about how we can only hope sex would be that good. I was mortified... not my kind of humour and I found it very innappropriate coming from a medical professional."
2090,"The appointments for my sprouting allergies.  For backstory I grew up on the coast and have indigenous family that I went fishing/crabbing with often when I was younger.  At 16-17 I started having allergic reactions to the point where the hives covered my entire torso/arms and no skin was regular level, all swollen.  Ended up in emergency because it had never happened before.  Nurse gets me hooked up to IV, for through one bag (benadryl or saline can't remember what goes first) and the machine starts beeping.  Doctor comes by and starts pressing buttons, says 'I don't know how to stop it's.  Blood starts leaving my body going *up* the tube.  Cue me worrying because I've never had an IV before and I didn't agree to have my blood leave my body.  He says ""this is why we have nurses"" and leaves to get one.  Everything was fine after that.
So my mom schedules an allergist appointment for me where I get pricked.  Turns out the main culprits were crab and ibuprofen.  We want to make sure and know how severe so she books an appointment in Vancouver.  We go as a family.  They have me eat tiny bits of crab and look for a reaction.  I'm there for four hours from the first bites, and nothing happens so we leave.  It's a bit of a walk from the office to the sky train, we get some lunch (chicken and rice, nothing that'd make me react) and hop on a train to go shopping.  Need the bathroom.  In the mirror my neck and chest are red, I realize that tickle isn't my hair it's an itch.  I tell my mom and we go back, by then it's been over five hours since we started.  I get in.  They ask ""are you sure it's an allergic reaction?"". I've been carrying my purse and everywhere it's rubbed, everywhere my bra has rubbed, everywhere my shirt has rubbed, is burning.  I'm like yep, these are hives, this is a reaction.  I go in to the doctor's office and they look at my back ""oh wow yeah this is an allergic reaction"".  No shit.  Got some meds and they made me wait another hour to make sure it went away.  

TLDR: for allergies.  Doctor can't operate IV machine.  Allergist didn't believe me when my brand new allergies took 5hrs to react."
2091,"Bit of a negative one here. Went to my doctor (a new one as the doctor I had been seeing for years retired), with some pretty awful pains in my upper right abdomen. The pain wasn't constant, but there would be points during the day where I was literally rendered immobile by how badly it hurt. So, I go to see him, and he starts examining my abdomen and asking me questions. Pretty standard ""how long has this been happening?"" questions, but, then he asks me if I drink and/or party a lot. I'm 18. Now, I know that it's not uncommon for 18 year-olds to get drunk, and have a good time, but I know for a fact that I did, and do, not drink enough to give myself horrible abdominal pain. So, I tell him, no, I do not drink regularly, and he proceeds to ask me if I am sure. Thus, for the next 20 minutes I am berated by my doctor who at this point is pretty much just accusing me of getting shit-faced every other day, while I am insisting that I don't drink that much, and that this is ridiculous. Left the appointment livid and with no treatment recommendations, went to a new doctor and discovered that my gallbladder was just messing everything up inside of me due to a genetic issue I inherited from my mom."
2092,"More unmemorable: occupational health physician kept asking me why I wasn't pregnant during my pre-employment health screening. I was 24 at the time and he just kept asking ""but you're gonna have kids someday aren't you? Don't want that nice uterus to go to waste! How does your boyfriend feel about you not wanting kids?"" And then on the elevator out someone wished me a Happy Mother's Day. NOT EVERY WOMAN WANTS KIDS GOD DAMMIT AND NO WOMAN OWES YOU A REASON FOR WHY SHE DOESN'T WANT KIDS"
2093,[removed]
2094,"The first time I went to my new doctor, I had to get some blood tests. For some reason I hadn‚Äôt eaten breakfast that day. After the nurse was done drawing blood I was like ‚Äúok I‚Äôm really dizzy I think I‚Äôm just gonna sit here for a bit‚Äù and the nurse immediately moved a chair in front of me, sat down, and braced her knees against mine. ‚ÄúThis way, if you fall over, you‚Äôll fall into my lap instead of onto the floor,‚Äù she said. After she was sure I wasn‚Äôt gonna keel over, she went and got me a bottle of water and a granola bar, and kept an eye on me until I could stand up.

I felt so taken care of, it was wonderful. I‚Äôve never met another nurse like that before. She‚Äôs been amazing every other time I‚Äôve been there too."
2095,The midwife offering me gas when I was in labour.
2096,I'm sad that any non-Germans won't be able to appreciate that properly.
2097,"I am an American that has learned German, but in school they don‚Äôt really teach you any slang. Glad I know this one now üôä"
2098,"oh yeah, it was absolutely fantastic having that thing hanging out half-assed from my cervix all while being told over the phone ''pain and bleeding is normal, this will settle with time''. when it finally came out, one of the arms was completely bent straight and could not be coaxed into its original position. i took it to them like that.

it really pisses me off how hard they're pushing IUDs these days (i was satisfied with the one i had, but coerced into swapping to a mirena because it is soooo much better and free of charge!) and how they're trying to normalize the pain we're in."
2099,"Getting a branch skewered through my pelvis and than removed is sexy, in a way. Lol"
2100,what the *fuck*

2102,"ooof! that is not awesome. so sorry that happened to you. mine definitely did not settle with time, it was made worse with time."
2103,"Hell yes! I absolutely love my IUD, but it's just not an option for everyone. It comes down to soooo many individual factors. Praising it as tge perfect solution is dangerous."
2104,I was wearing a miniskirt and didn't realize I'd have to do a blood draw that day.
2105,"Someone once told me ""wow, you really don't give a shit what people think, do you"". They meant it in a way to cut me down, but really it warmed my cold, dark heart."
2106,Someone told me I looked like the main character in that playdooh-like animated movie ‚Äúchicken run‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt forgot about that and never will
2107,"A ""friend"" of mine told me to stop laughing because my laugh was ugly and annoying. That one hurt and it made me feel bad about laughing and try to avoid it for many many years"
2108,That I‚Äôd be so much prettier if I just lost some weight. So many of us have copped that line but it hurts.
2109,"I've been told a good amount by men I've gone on dates with via Tinder that my pictures are inaccurate and I look much better in person. A few weeks ago (and the guy was probably just trying to be nice), he called me a reverse catfish. It's one of the few things that has warmed my heart. I have very little self esteem physically so when I think of what they said, it makes me feel a lot better."
2110,"My boyfriend when I was 16 told me my nose looked like a strawberry. I asked why and he said because of all the blackheads covering it. I got offended and he tried to justify himself by saying he meant it in a cute way. I'm now 23, married (to someone else), with a baby on the way and still think about what he said every time I look in the mirror at my nose."
2111,"Once, when we were moving away from a place someone told me I had actually left the town better than I‚Äôd found it in complimenting me on a charity project I‚Äôd worked on. It was a small project but it was really important to the people it helped. We all get to leave our mark on the world so I‚Äôm trying to leave it just a little bit better than I found it."
2112,"Two stuck with me to this day, one negative and one positive.

When I was 13 and honestly at my worst -think chubby, acne, frizzy hair- the very first time I went to my male friend's house, his mom came out, took a look at me, and said, in a pretty condescending tone: ""Well, she must be beautiful *inside*, right?"". I lost weight and started taking care of myself afterwards, but for years I couldn't shake the feeling that that would be everyone's first thought upon seeing me.

The positive was around the same time, a bit earlier. There was a guy who had been bullying me for a while -nothing extreme,but still unpleasant- and for some reason our teacher had seated us right next to each other. One day I caught him staring at me, and he had this weirded out expression, very confused. I asked what was going on, and he said, in an usually plain and honest voice, ""You have beautiful eyes, though"". I later figured he'd been thinking of something mean to say and accidentally blurted out just the final part of his thought. Still, it gave me a much needed boost of confidence, and I've felt great about my eyes ever since."
2113,"When I was 10 years old, one of my good friends said to me, ""It's a shame, you're the smartest girl in the school but you're also the ugliest."" I'm 27 and I still remember that comment and it really affected how I saw myself through my adolescence."
2114,"‚ÄúI love being around you cause you have such a positive energy and you‚Äôre always complimenting people. I‚Äôm going to try to be more like you.‚Äù

A friend of my friend said this to me when we were 16. We‚Äôd occasionally hang out with our mutual friends but didn‚Äôt know each other much. One day this just came out of nowhere. I was really surprised, it wasn‚Äôt a conscious effort on my part to be positive or compliment. It made me feel good tho to hear that. I think it‚Äôs inspired me to be less inhibited about complimenting people and pointing out good things they do. I guess she inspired me to try to be, or continue to be, the person she saw me as."
2115,"As I was walking my dog on a cold day in my neighborhood, I hadn‚Äôt even showered yet and wearing my husband‚Äôs oversized ski coat with no makeup on. A lady stopped me and asked me if I was a model. Even on my worst days, remembering that makes me feel a little better about myself."
2116,People in Thailand said I'll never be seen as pretty because of my dark skin.
2117,"""Don't worry, for your 18th birthday I'll give you breast implants as gift""

My mother told me this as I entered puberty. It really made me self conscious about my breasts.
Fortunately I learnt how to feel sexy despite being flat-chested. Now I'm cool with it"
2118,"""You have such beautiful skin, shame about the face though.""

Basically I had no right to have such perfect skin while being somewhat less than attractive, while her daughter,  who was very beautiful had terrible skin. Thanks lady."
2119,"In high school, a guy I didn't get along with very well once told me my brown/hazel eyes looked like ""little drops of poop"". I can't help but think about it a lot haha I don't feel particularly negative about it, it's just stuck with me."
2120,"I recently got told ""you look like A burn victim"" isnt there surgery to fix your face. This isnt the first comment I have gotton about my acne and acne scars. I've had it all my life and god. If they only knew how long it took to love myself üíî and somedays its hard.."
2121,"People at NASA said that I had ""dogged determination"".

^(*then why didn't you fund me then, huh??*) \*sobbing\*"
2122,"When I was 17 and in the pub underage with my much slimmer and prettier friends some lads from the year above came over to talk to us.

One of them in particular was really chatty and good looking. When he asked us to come and sit with him and his mates he said "" Sally, Karen...girl in the middle "" although he didn't say anything directly about my looks me bring totally forgettable and invisible devastated me.

I've never forgot it and I've worked so hard to not be forgettable that I'm probably a bit overbearing now."
2123,"A friend in school told me that my eyes are ‚Äúsheep-shit green with weird bits‚Äù. They are an odd colour green but I also have sectoral heterochromia, with dark green spots and my left eye has an orange spot. She told me that when I was 14/15, and I‚Äôm 39 now, but its still something I‚Äôm self-conscious of."
2124,"My ex, after cheating on me, said ‚ÄúI mean, she has a better personality than you, but you‚Äôre hotter. Doesn‚Äôt that make you feel better?‚Äù 

Newsflash: No. no it doesn‚Äôt. On the flip side, I spent the following years working on myself and doing self-improvement."
2125,"A very direct European man (from France) told me that I had a ""very well developed buttocks"" and that he wished the women in his country were as sculpted in the derriere as me.  Was the most formal and sophisticated way someone has even said ""nice ass"" to me"
2126,That no one will ever love me because I am worthless retard. My father told me that when I was five. I have been insecure ever since especially when it comes to my intelligence. I also struggle in my marriage because I always feel like Im unloved or he will leave me.
2127,I've been told I have a big butt since I was in middle school and sometimes it feels like a defining trait.  :-/
2128,"""you're pretty for a black girl"" kinda fcked me up for a few years"
2129,"I'm still angry at the dude who said at the middle of a dance event: ""you don't look it but you're a fabulous dancer.""

Fuck him, you don't have to be thin to ceilidh."
2130,"In kindergarten at recess a boy told me I had gorilla arms, as I naturally have dark, thick hair on my arms. I thought about it a lot after that, and when I started shaving my legs later in my life, I started shaving my arms too. To this day I still shave my arms, I‚Äôd rather have hairless arms than ‚Äúgorilla arms‚Äù I guess. When people have asked me why I do it, I always tell them about the gorilla arms comment. It just stuck in my brain."
2131,Multiple people have told me I look prettier/cooler on Instagram than in real life. I guess I‚Äôm photogenic but ugly irl.
2132,"They told me I was cold.

It hurt me because I‚Äôve always struggled to form Deep emotional connections. I did not come from an overtly affectionate home, so being overtly loving is something I did not know how to practise. I‚Äôve always prioritised logic over emotion and I feel as a woman, people don‚Äôt always take to that very well. 

However, with age, experience and self reflection, I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs okay to be vulnerable, expressive about your emotions (in a healthy way) and be overtly loving and affectionate. I use pet names now, hug and smile a lot more and also ask how people feel. I‚Äôve always said ‚Äúwhat do you think?/what are you doing to do?‚Äù But I‚Äôve noticed my change of language has altered how people take to me which is nice."
2133,"I've been told I should become a hand model. Considering I have a few thin scars paler than my skin on them (both from working in engineering and from me growing up and working outside with farmers as parents - one even is even a small scar from a bad burn from when I was 6), I generally don't find my hands special/attractive in any way and don't get the reasoning so maybe that's why it sticks with me."
2134,A teacher in high school said she couldn‚Äôt stand my monotone voice. 20 years later and I still listen out for my tone(s).
2135,He told me that my laughter warms his heart. :)
2136,"was around 13/14 when a friend of mine said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre actually really pretty but you‚Äôd be so much prettier if you had lighter skin‚Äù this coupled with the whole asian ‚Äúlight is good‚Äù/‚ÄúEuropean beauty is the ideal and what you should strive for‚Äù kind of mentality, it took me years to undo of all my insecure ways of thinking. 

I still have a little trouble today but I mostly remind myself that what I look like cannot be changed, just accepted and the sooner I do that with an open mind, the happier I‚Äôll be"
2137,"I heard second-hand once that someone thought I was boring, and this combined with many experiences where it seemed like people didn't like me for some reason make it hard to be confident about making friends"
2138,"""your boobs make you look super chubby."" I'm 95 pounds..."
2139,"After college graduation, a casual acquaintance gave me a huge hug and thanked me for being ""sunshine personified""... possibly the greatest compliment I have ever received"
2140,"My friend in high school told me I had large gums and now that's all I can look at in pictures.

My other friend pointed out that my nose bounces when I talk and now I'm always conscious of it"
2141,That‚Äôd I‚Äôd be so beautiful (/hot / ‚Äúa knockout l‚Äù) if I lost some weight
2142,"My aunt and mom have always told me since I was like 5, that I have ""perfect"" lips. Later, some guy in my 7th grade science class used ""your lips are cool"" as a pick up line lol"
2143,"In high school I heard through a friend that a boy that had just moved to the school couldn't remember my name and called me ""that girl with the pig nose"" and I'm still so self conscious about how small my nose is"
2144,My current boss told me that when I walked into the office to hand my CV in that I looked really striking. Its stuck with me and made me love my blonde hair even more!
2145,"1. You‚Äôre really pretty for a mixed girl 
2. You‚Äôre just not the type of girl a guy dates, you‚Äôre the type of girl a guy cheats on his girlfriend with 
3. Your personality is perfect but you‚Äôre just not my type 
4. ‚ÄúI like blonde, no boobs, no ass cunts and you‚Äôre just not that sorry.‚Äù 
5. You‚Äôre pretty but I don‚Äôt find you beautiful"
2146,"I had pretty bad acne throughout puberty and early adulthood while almost everyone  from my maternal side has poreless smooth skin. 

My mum once told me my skin looked like Chinese crackling roasted pork skin. She even pointed that out to other people. 

https://www.recipetineats.com/chinese-crispy-pork-belly/

Even though I don't get acne often now, I still feel and think I have crispy pork skin. 

I had been avoiding wearing earring fearing it might draw attention to my face. Once I finally went to shop for my first pair of diamond studs (really cheap and puny stones), all I saw was my blemishes. The salesperson gave me a puzzled look when I commented on my blemishes instead of how I looked in the studs. 

That was a wake up call. Acne damaged not only my skin, but also how I perceive myself. I had been focusing on my flaws, and having perfectionist tendency myself, there had been many times I stopped doing before I started, fearing my shortcomings would cause failure. 

I have to love myself more, the old me, the current me, and the future me. I bought the pair of studs to remind myself about it."
2147,"I‚Äôve had a few over the years, but these have always stuck out:

1: You kinda look like a cat, like, you have sharp eyes and have this look like cats do ya know? -said by middle school friend who always gave me backhanded compliments. Not sure how I still feel about that comment, but I tend to think about it anytime I look long enough in the mirror...

2: I don‚Äôt typically date/sleep with bigger girls, but you‚Äôre pretty cute/adorable/‚Äúsexy‚Äù/etc. -said by not one, not two, but five different guys I have dated in the past. It‚Äôs taken me years to just be stable enough to actually like who I am, both on the outside and within, so anytime an asshole like those guys would say that shit it knocked me down several pegs. Took me way too long to bounce back after I would promptly dump their ass because it made me think that I should be thankful anyone would want me because I‚Äôm not skinnier. 

Nowadays I stay away from anyone who gives me red flags on the first date if they say some backhanded compliments about my appearance."
2148,"I used to have an account on OKCupid and a man, after I had ignored his first several messages, followed up with ""Has anyone ever tried to land a plane on your forehead?""

Before this moment, I had never even considered that I had a large forehead. Now I see it every time I look in the mirror."
2149,"Colleague said ‚ÄúDo we need a bigger elevator?‚Äù
I told her ‚Äúput a sock in it‚Äù and I was the one who got in trouble with HR"
2150,"A friend of mine once told me that my skin was like porcelain, and wanted to know what makeup I used- I wasn‚Äôt wearing any. It made me feel a lot more confident."
2151,"Why are so many of these sad? :( i like to remember being called things like a real gem, a giant ball of sunshine, I‚Äôm unlike anyone they‚Äôve met before, I have such a strong sense of curiosity, there‚Äôs something interesting about me. I‚Äôm an oddball and I know it so I always remember when people see and appreciate me."
2152,"My professor once described me as 'silent-strong' on a recommendation letter (the interviewer told me this)

I had to look it up to see what it meant, but I felt really flattered and it stuck with me for years."
2153,"Two female cashiers told me I was pretty and should model, they also told me I had a nice side profile, major confidence boost."
2154,"My uncle's friend went to the beach with my entire family on the fourth of July when I was in Middle School, she spent most of the night telling my sisters how pretty they are, how they're probably going to be prom/homecoming queen, a model, etc. Then she looked at me and said that I better hope I'm smart, because I definitely don't have the looks. At 13, I was a scrawny, acne ridden, slightly greasy kid (turns out dollar tree shampoo and conditioner didn't do me any favors) who looked nothing like my blonde haired, blue eyed siblings. At 25, I still actively try to look like my older sisters, but with my own twist. I'll admit that I've started intermittent fasting, and working out (even if I'm a healthy 115), I'm anal about my face when I break out, and I spend an obscene amount on redken hair care."
2155,Growing up I didn‚Äôt know how to do my hair ( still don‚Äôt know much) so I would always just part it to the side and brush it and be on my way. My mom would always say that I look like an ugly witch. It‚Äôs always stuck with me since I was a little kid I‚Äôm still trying to learn how to brush off her insults.
2156,"I was in the presence of this Irish lady for a total of like ten minutes when she turned to me said, ""You really feel like no one ever listens to you. Your whole life you think you've never been heard."" And I was so shaken by that I burst into tears. Never got over that."
2157,"I was dancing with this guy my first time going out in college and he told me ""you're kinda fat but we can make it work"". For reference, I'm 5'9"" and 140lbs (which regardless, who the fuck says that anyways). I decided that it was not going to work and walked away."
2158,My dad said my nose was bulbous
2159,"""When are you going to lose that weight?"" -my dad

I was 118lbs and 5'1 at the time."
2160,Someone once told me my eyes are the color of poop
2161,"My Labia is apparently symmetrical and fleshy, which I‚Äôm told is attractive"
2162,"""She's no \[my very beautiful sister\], but on the upside, she won't have any boys tempting her to disobey her husband."" -- my step-father, attempting to convince a man who asked to marry my sister, who ran away soon after, that I'd be an acceptable substitute. She was smarter, too."
2163,"Someone once told me that I have loud eyes, in relation to how expressive they are and I was like wow"
2164,You would look pretty if your nose wasnt this big.
2165,My eighth grade teacher told me and my entire class that I‚Äôm ‚Äúvery photogenic but that isn‚Äôt the same as being pretty‚Äù. Still makes me mad ten years later lol
2166,"""Sure you're pretty but you also have an innocent look about [you](https://you.You). You'll attract all sorts, but especially the ones who like you enough to sleep with you, but not with you."""
2167,‚ÄúYou‚Äôre much prettier when you smile.‚Äù I take that advice every day and try to put a smile on when I wake up.
2168,"My ex, who was lovely in every other respect, once made a joke about my chest being flat and...I've not taken it well, even years later. 

Edit: This doesn't sting anymore because I've since cut my mother out of my life and no longer value her thoughts (RBN fam), but what really fucked me up for my childhood was when I got something wrong and she told me I, ""could be pretty and stupid, or ugly and smart, but couldn't be both ugly and stupid."""
2169,"I was really good friends with a slightly older boy when I was in middle school, I think I was 14 or 15 when he was 18 or 19. I met him through a friend at the time that was one of the ‚Äútrashier‚Äù people in my town, to put it in perspective when we all hung out we‚Äôd mostly just smoke cigarettes behind businesses. 

I trusted him a fair bit and therefore went to him when I needed advice or when I was having a bad day. I remember one day he said something to me like, ‚ÄúAll you ever do is talk about YOURSELF!‚Äù and from that day forward I‚Äôve always been paranoid that whenever I‚Äôm talking to someone that I‚Äôm talking about myself too much. 

Our friendship kind of dwindled after that because I was convinced he didn‚Äôt even like me anymore after that and I stopped talking to him as much. Rest his soul, he passed away a few years later from melanoma. We were both troubled, so I don‚Äôt think he meant it to be malicious I think he was having a bad day and lashed out but it is ingrained in my mind that I‚Äôm constantly talking about myself too much."
2170,"My sister told me in my teens I smile too big.now I dont smile and now everyone says ‚Äúsmile‚Äù... even strangers.. which is annoying.
Also I have big eyes"
2171,My last girlfriend loved my arms. And I really started seeing it as a plus side. My lower arms are about as big as some peoples upper arms/biceps. Im not buff at all. But my arms are huge.
2172,"Someone has commented on most parts of my personality or looks.  They‚Äôve all stuck.  On my bad days, I focus on them.  On the good days, I don‚Äôt remember them."
2173,"From elementary school through middle school I was constantly ridiculed for being fat. I developed a serious body image issue. I'm 35 now and my husband often remarks on the way I see myself vs the way everybody else sees me.

The worst part is as a child I wasn't even fat. I used to be thin enough to wear a bikini to the beach and look damn good in it, in hindsight. But at the time I thought I was a fat cow and felt awkward in a one-piece and shorts.

I've been working on it, and in my 30s and *actually* fat I'm still more secure with myself, my body, and my choices than I was when I was fit and thought I was a fat, ugly whale. I think it might be a bit petty (since we were all kids at the time) but I have never forgiven the people who gave me this complex and probably never will."
2174,"When I was in high school, a group of kids in my creative writing class who were into Twilight told me I looked like a werewolf because of my teeth..."
2175,"That I look tired even when I'm not, someone told me that when I was a child. I think it's because I'm very fair and so the veins under my eyes show quite a bit, so I look like I have bags."
2176,"Someone I thought was a dear friend to me said that everything about me is annoying. He hates my laugh,  my voice is loud and irritating. Even my existence is making him miserable. 

This was a year ago, he was the reason that I tried to commit suicide twice during that week. I loved him and cared for him. I let him tear me apart and pressured myself to be perfect as a friend and human. Everyone who knew us decided to side with him. 

To this day, the words he said comes back to me, even though I'm around much better people, I sometimes get a huge moment of anxiety and panic where I just think that everyone is faking liking me. I sometimes hate my own laugh..."
2177,"When I was 9 I was told that I was so ugly only a blind person would marry me. When I was 12 I overheard a friend of my crush tell him not to bother because I was ugly. One of my early boyfriends told me I had old man hands. My mother constantly telling me how cute I used to be when I was in highschool, ""you used to be so cute and tiny!"" So, I kinda have major self esteem issues."
2178,‚ÄúYou is smart. You is somewhat kind. You is not that important.‚Äù True enough but daaaaamn.
2179,My fourth grade teacher described my personality as ‚Äúbubbly‚Äù and it‚Äôs what I continue to strive to be.
2180,[removed]
2181,That I look like a caveman because I have a large brow bone and thick eyebrows :(
2182,"A former ""friend"" told me once: 'If I was casting for a film, you'd be the perfect other woman.' Not the worst thing I've ever heard, for sure, but really stung."
2183,"My mother said I was a narcissist once. I asked her if she really thought and that and she said ""don't make me answer that"". It altered my entire mental state for years. Every second since that moment I was unsure if I was actually an arrogant, unlovable selfish jerk because if you think you're not narcissistic *that is exactly what a narcissist would think.* I pored over medical texts and diagnostics and I didn't *think* it matched but of course I wouldn't.

A few months ago I saw a psychologist because of signs of autism (she confirmed it, no one was surprised). I took the opportunity to ask if she saw signs of narcissism. She said not at all. Few times in my life have I been so relieved.

My mother's actually a great mother and very caring. She just doesn't understand what narcissistic personality disorder is compared to the stereotypes, like most people. She's in the medical field in a different discipline though, so I was just unsure enough to be worried."
2184,"I have big eyes. People first thought it was a bad look on and then I guess when my features matured a bit more then all of a sudden it's one of my best features. 

I rememebr wishing I had smaller eyes, till I met people who did have smaller eyes than me and told me their stories that sounded similar to mine just reversed. That's when I thought evermind I'll appreciate what I have, I cant please everyone."
2185,"Someone told me I looked like Claire Danes in Romeo and Juliet. Then my ex told me my body reminded him of Scarlett Johansson. Naturally, I‚Äôm thrilled. But a friend insists I look like Amelia Earhart and now I don‚Äôt know how I feel. My brain dives into a squiggle when I try and make sense of it. I hate that I care but I do."
2186,"Positive: you're eyes are amazing

Negative: you're always going to be ""BIG"""
2187,"In grade 10, a boy at a party said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre really cute, you just gotta work on your ass‚Äù. I still to this day feel like my bum is too small and always wear long shirts."
2188,"when I was middle school my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù at the time was a dancer and was more physically in shape than me. Most of the boys had a crush on her, and I remember one day she said that the trick was to have a perky butt like hers, not a flat one like mine. It was a passing comment, but her words will occasionally come back into my head when I workout or see myself in the mirror"
2189,"About my looks: ""You wont be pretty forever. What are you going to do then?"" 

About my personality: ""You are poison. I wouldn't spit on you if you were on fire"""
2190,"I‚Äôve been told on multiple occasions that I resemble a ‚ÄúWho‚Äù, like from doctor Seuss.. I actually find it pretty funny."
2191,"‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt beautiful, but you are attractive.‚Äù

When my 17 year old ass heard that it has stuck with me for over a decade, at the time I didn‚Äôt quite get it but it was a really horrible thing to say I think! She was my best friend. Oh and also a guy at uni that said my body was ‚Äúbanging‚Äù but my face was ‚Äúbutters‚Äù I am pretty sure he is a meth head now. I thought I was decent looking but apparently not!"
2192,"Some boys during 8th grade summer school made fun of me to other girls asking why i sit with my butt out so much. I was really shy and wasnt even aware i was doing this. When the girls told me the boys are making fun of you, i got really embarrassed and remember wanting to try to fix how i sit. 

Well fast forward to now, i turn heads with my ass. SO WHOS LAUGHING NOW?!?? The comments really did hurt me when i was young though."
2193,"""she's hot but she talks too much"" I was/am not hot. And I definitely did not talk too much. But I remember it. People had criticised how I looked before but no one had criticised my personality."
2194,You have a beautiful smile.
2195,"My ex told me that once I set my mind to doing something there‚Äôs no changing it. I just go out and accomplish what I say I‚Äôm gonna do.

Our breakup devastated me, and was just one of many difficult life events I went through in a really hard year and low point/depression, but I never stopped and realized or applauded myself for the things I accomplished that year and how I still kept going."
2196,"Someone in dance class once said if I couldn't find work, 'at least I'd be able to dance in a strip club for money'. I like to think she meant it as a compliment and I decided to take it as such."
2197,"""You're pretty, but not THAT pretty"" this was when I was like 14, and I've grown into my looks and confidence since then. But it really stuck with me. It came from me joking around with my ""friend"" asking why gross guys would always hit on me (not even like lookswise, just sketchy dudes). And she said that. I remember I glared at her and just walked out of the room and we were never friends again lol"
2198,"My mom has a really large butt, so every since I was young she would say ""wow you don't have a butt at all"" or ""your butt is so flat"". And she insists its a compliment even if I tell her it hurts my feelings."
2199,My friend told me in high school that I reminded her of the pedestrian fish off of spongebob when I don‚Äôt have makeup on. It still makes me laugh to this day
2200,"‚ÄúWell, she‚Äôll never win prettiest girl in the room.‚Äù"
2201,"That I looked weird. I wasn‚Äôt ugly, but wasn‚Äôt attractive either. I‚Äôm a white passing biracial woman, basically white skin with Native American features he was trying to describe that I ‚Äúlooked different‚Äù and I understood but I got those comments so much that it made me self conscious."
2202,"""I know you're a good person."" I'm not convinced he was right, but a friend told me that when I was upset about something and second-guessing myself, and it was reassuring."
2203,In a very obvious sarcastic tone ‚ÄúNice nose‚Äù and ‚Äúyour teeth aren‚Äôt AS BAD as they used to be‚Äù (I got braces but the retainers were weak and broke) both have been and always will be my biggest insecurities
2204,"7th grade picture day i guess i was sitting kind of hunched over and the photographer huffed angrily and stepped away from the camera. she told me i had an ""unusually long torso"" and had to sit up straight. Then she asked me and i quote ""does your mother know you look like a turkey??"" tbh was too funny to be overly hurtful and i still laugh about it but to this day how long my torso is in comparison to my legs is one of my bigger insecurities about my body"
2205,"Growing up I wasnt particularly self conciousabout my face. When I was about 18, my mam told me I should get my overbite looked at while I was going to the dentist for a checkup. I never knew/noticed I had an overbite. Now it's the thing I hate the most about my appearance and I'm extremely self conscious about it."
2206,"I‚Äôve been told my whole life, by strangers and those who know me, that I‚Äôm an old soul. My grandmother once told me that the moment her mother held me in her arms as a newborn, she said she could feel that I was an old soul. I really love that.

While I‚Äôm quite a modern woman, I love being called an old soul because it connotes a sense of wisdom, self-reflection and intuition."
2207,That I look better with straight hair than my natural curly hair.
2208,"In fourth grade, this asshole of a kid kept calling me Medusa. Still haven‚Äôt gotten over it."
2209,One of my teachers in high school once randomly told me that my smile was going to make me successful in life and I still think about that especially when I‚Äôm not feeling particularly useful
2210,that i look like a hamster
2211,My three year old cousin (at the time) told me my hair looked nice. I hated my hair. This was the best thing ever to hear from her
2212,"Year and years ago, a friend in high school told me I‚Äôm down to earth. I‚Äôll always remember that. 

I was told I lack integrity sometime this past year. That still hurts and probably will forever. But at least it‚Äôs made me take a look at myself."
2213,"I'm not large, per se. I'm not small, too. However, asian beauty leans on the thinner side. Growing up, I've always been called big/large/huge by people. I eventually worked out and had gotten quite thinner, but my arms and legs were still fatty. They'd tease and say I have chicken legs because of my calf, they'd even tease that I was manlier than the males because I had bigger arms and overall built than them, I was on the taller side, too(for women). The worse thing though yet being called mother-like because of my big built as a woman with large hips"
2214,That I look better with glasses oof
2215,"""Omg you're so random, I love you"""
2216,"My ex, trying to convince me to take my hood off : You're beautiful and you never show it."
2217,"They were a writer and said offhandedly that they liked listening to me talk because it gives them inspiration for dialogue. I looked back to things I‚Äôve written (stories, poetry, texts, Reddit posts etc) and said I didn‚Äôt really get what they meant. They said that when I‚Äôm just holding a conversation and not thinking about it I have a really unique style of conversing. Makes me happy to think that something normal to me isn‚Äôt normal for someone else."
2218,"It was couple of years ago, but my scary, female, straight teacher said I looked like a model :) she was walking past me, and just suddenly said it. I was completely dumbfounded, but it‚Äôs stuck with me for ages \^\_\^"
2219,"When I was younger someone told me I looked like Ugly Betty. I‚Äôve since gotten rid of the front fringe and gotten contacts but shit, I still sometimes think fuck am I really that horrible that the defining thing people think is ugly?"
2220,"I have this one friend who really is a friend, but sometimes is self-centered. We're both black, and were talking once about guys. I don't remember exactly my wording, but I said something about how she got approached more and I wondered if it had something to do with the fact that she's light skinned and I'm dark skinned. And she kinda scoffs and goes ""I mean... duh."" 

It was one of those moments where you're like.... did that shit actually just happen? I still hold a small level of resentment toward her for that, and in a way hate going to bars and parties with her because I have to watch her words play out every time we're around men. On the plus side, though, it inspired me to write one of my final papers on colorism in dating, and I got an A lol"
2221,"Got complimented on my eyebrow makeup once. I had no eyebrow makeup on. This stuck with me because when I do makeup, I leave my eyebrows alone 99% and save myself some time. It‚Äôs pretty convenient."
2222,"I was told by a friend in high school
That I have pretty knees. It‚Äôs so random it‚Äôs always stuck with me."
2223,"My former boss said you would look like a model if you got into shape. She was a female attorney and wanted her female employees to look good, with makeup, and dress well.  Still bothers me for some reason."
2224,"In middle school we did an end of the year assignment where everyone in the class pulled a name randomly from a basket and had to write to that person. I didn‚Äôt know anyone in that class and was really shy. A popular boy pulled my name and wrote ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really quiet, but I can tell you are a good listener and take a lot in. Never change.‚Äù"
2225,‚ÄúYou‚Äôd look pretty with a bit of make up‚Äù that was nearly 15 years ago and it still hurts
2226,"My addiction counselor told me I was a hurricane. That I swept through and destroyed everyone's lives. That still resonates with me to this day, over two years sober and it will always be my goal to make everyone's lives that are part of mine, a happier, enjoyable, love filled experience."
2227,I was told that after a party someone's dad had commented about me and said that I was really cheerful and lit up a room with my energy and that had stuck with me. That's all I strive for ya'll
2228,"This sort of has to do with my personality, I guess, but I‚Äôve always been a runner- short distance, long distance, sprints, you name it- and I‚Äôve always loved it. In 6th grade I had a really tough time with it. I was always feeling like a failure because most of the other girls on our Cross Country team would be finished minutes ahead of my final time. So in 7th grade since I realized just how much all the pressure and weight of being the best me, I decided from then on I would only run for fun, and thinking about that was already making me feel much better. 
Come 8th grade, I had a running friend who I was always really close to, and she was always ahead of me in the races, but it never really bothered me. Often times we would decide to go running together after practices or on weekends, just to blow steam or keep in shape over breaks. 
For some reason she thought it would be funny I guess to start running ahead of me after we both were going at our usual steady and firm pace -that we understood would be our race pace in meets- and sometimes kept running ahead even after I had slowed to a walk to show her that the rate we were going at was more then I was used to, and was like we were getting chased by lions or something (I guess to show me she didn‚Äôt really give a shit and wanted to keep her momentum going, which I understood, but it never really registered in my mind until one time soon after)
After a few weeks had passed of our 8th grade season of Cross Country she flat out said in front of the rest of our running group that she thought, and ‚Äúknew‚Äù, that I was slower than her. Her exact words were, ‚ÄúYeah, I totally get that, running is tough sometimes, right (my name)? Other times though I just feel like some of us don‚Äôt try hard enough in races, and it gets pretty pathetic after some time. Some people just aren‚Äôt meant for running. Now now, don‚Äôt take this personally (my name), you just need to work harder, maybe eat less ice cream and all that junk. Don‚Äôt worry, though. Maybe we can talk to the coaches about some different... easier arrangement for you, so you‚Äôre not as tired all the time. Just keep running with me and you‚Äôll catch up sooner or later!‚Äù
Yeah, that hurt. I never really saw her in the same way again after that, and eventually just stopped being friends with her all together. I realized that the reason why I had always felt like shit when it came to running in 6th and 7th was because of her. She would always be calling me out on my times then bragging about hers, making ‚Äúare you for real?‚Äù faces at me and pulling me aside to accuse me of lying to our friends when I had gotten more laps then her in practice, and even just bluntly stating ‚Äúwow (my name) rough race wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù because I would always come past the finish line after her. 
Now if I‚Äôm being honest, during races, I tried of course, but I definitely did not push myself to the limits, because 
1.) My jogging speed was everyone else‚Äôs running speeds
2.) I didn‚Äôt care about who was watching and took my sweet time, because I liked doing it and it was fun to me, and middle school meets aren‚Äôt as serious as HS ones
And 3.) If I ran at my full limit throughout every race, it would make me feel entitled to do so the next race, and it would give me horrible anxiety and butterflies. Sometimes that feeling got so strong to points where I would throw up, because I really did not like being but under pressure, lol. 
During practiceS I was always sweaty as fuck because I was always working my ass off. Of course to her, however, this made it seem like I was out of shape and tired out of my mind, when really I was going the extra mile. Every. Single. Day. Along with making sure I was doing the everyday workout, then doing it again, and maybe a few more times (because I was still full of energy and wanted to do some more). I always was going back to help some of the slower kids on our team get up to the front of the lines, I was always leading team exercises and stretches twice if not three times a day, and at the end of every practice we went up to a set of huge, STEEP hills by our school. I was always volunteering to race friends up and down, and up and down the hills, -and mind you these hills were about about as long as a football field, and our coaches STILL made us run all the way up and all the way down- so yeah, I was going to be a *little* sweaty. 
This kind of cut me deep, because we had been friends for years, and I knew she always had known how hard I had worked and how much it meant to me to help everyone on our team be THE BEST they could be- not even just in CC, but in school too and with friends- even if it meant me losing all those connections and people when I left to go to HS. 
It‚Äôs just, really sad. She always knew how when I was younger I dealt with a lot of guilt and regret about how I looked and my bodily choices, so that‚Äôs why I took up running, only to find out I freaking loved it and it had eventually given me some beautiful curves and strong, big muscles everywhere. 
I‚Äôm still not friends with her today, but luckily nobody ever thought of me differently after she had said that, and now I have some pretty amazing friends. I hope that if any of you frequently get shot down by comments from people like her or anybody else, no matter who they are, that you will have the strength and courage to show them just how bad they make you feel, and how you really don‚Äôt want to hear whatever their opinions are about you. I hope you guys all also realize that people like that, even if they say ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt mean to say that to you‚Äù, they did. That‚Äôs why it came out of their mouths. I know there are very few excepts for that, but if they said it and said they didn‚Äôt mean to say it most of the times they didn‚Äôt, at least not at that time. They just want to save themselves from any remorse that might come back onto them because of it, and lie to make themselves feel better. If you‚Äôre gut is telling you they don‚Äôt make you feel good, stay away from them, and don‚Äôt keep running back to them especially if you know deep down they‚Äôre just going to keep on LYING and CHEATING and CHIPPING away at your heart. 
Be strong! Be confident! God has your side, and always will."
2229,"my parents and family always call me fat or make jokes about me being fat. this includes my parents, grandparents, and outside family. ive always hovered around 139 pounds and about a month ago i was 143. im 5‚Äô2 and dont know if im fat but i know im not ‚Äúskinny‚Äù.  ive always tried eating healthy and running. recently i changed my whole diet and im around 137-138. they dont call me fat anymore because they‚Äôve noticed i changed my diet but i still feel sick when i look at myself in the mirror or on my phone camera. im constantly comparing myself to other people and sometimes i just feel sick and convince myself that i cant get the guys i want because im not pretty."
2230,I got told I was a good person by a former co-worker. Struck my by surprise but made me feel good.
2231,"On my last day of primary school (aged 11), my teacher gave out cards to each of us, and she had wrote in mine ""You're so quiet, but when you do talk you're so funny"". It was the first time anyone had called me funny. Since then I've always been ""the funny one"" of the group, it really helped me build my social skills."
2232,"Growing up walked to school on the same route as my sister, and an old guy was always outside doing stuff on the street. I was polite and greeted him every day as we used to in a small village. One day he told me that my sister is much friendlier and smiles more. 
So what? Don't judge a book by it's cover. 
I'm an introvert but I'm a pretty happy person in general and I smile/laugh a lot around people I'm comfortable with."
2233,"Been told I was fat maybe once or twice ever, even though I‚Äôve never been close to overweight. Unfortunately for some reason that‚Äôs stuck with me and I always see this chubby girl staring back at me from the mirror."
2234,"I am 20 years old and I've never had a boyfriend. In the beginning (freshman year of highschool) I was asking myself whether I am not good looking enough and that's why no one is approaching me.
Nowadays, I do have self confidence and I know I'm not a fucking model, but I think I'm pretty and cute. 
So, like a year ago, my brother told me (he is older than me) that apparently I have this untouchable reputation in my town( it's a very small town where everyone knows eachother) and that guys are actually afraid to approach me. My best friend also told me that when she sees me in the club, she asks herself why do I look so unapproachable when apparently I'm a goofball. 
That has really stuck to me and I don't know what to do with that information because I am actually a very friendly person and I for sure don't have a resting bitch face, I look rather cute than bitchy, honestly."
2235,"""Oh man, she'd be a catch if she had some tits!""

Overheard in highschool pure knocked my self esteem"
2236,"Whenever I was in college, one of my close friends was always in fights going back and forth with her roommate and when the time came to add a new person to their household they both begged me to live with them. When I asked both of them, separately told me that they had a like a negative cloud in their place and whenever I was around I had such a good vibe. That I was essentially just such a positive and warm vibe to be around. 
I didn‚Äôt end up living with them, seemed like a bad idea lol. But those words always made me feel really proud of myself, and since then I make an effort try to make sure that wherever I am, I‚Äôm positive and warm and make everyone around me feel loved and supported. I didn‚Äôt realize before that anyone noticed or that it affected other people."
2237,"A girl in my middle school once asked me if she could braid my hair. I said, ""Sure!"" She then proceeds to grab my arm and tousle my arm hair. Cool."
2238,"A coworker in college once told me I have DSEs. Ya know, dick-sucking eyes instead of dick-sucking lips (DSLs). Now I low-key think of that every time someone tells me I have beautiful eyes. Ah, good old workplace sexual harassment."
2239,"I was told I was a follower not a leader which causes me to struggle with enjoying the same things others do. I get that I‚Äôm supposed to be my own person but people can be generalized in what they like, I feel like I can‚Äôt be the leader no matter how hard I try."
2240,I look like Toucan Sam because of my nose that I'm already self conscious about.
2241,"When I was 11, a boy in my class told me I looked like a neanderthal because I had a big nose. Been self conscious about it ever since."
2242,"I‚Äôve always had super big and long hair so 99% of the compliments I receive center around that. 

I cry every time I need to get a hair cut because if it gets messed up then there goes the only thing people notice about me."
2243,"‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never find a boyfriend with that big nose‚Äù -sister
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never find a man looking like that‚Äù-all 4 siblings and parents about my weight. Hey hey! Guess who‚Äôs the happiest now? Mwa:)"
2244,My hair color being unique.
2245,"An older woman once told me in an elevator after a long day, when I wasn‚Äôt wearing makeup, I had bags under my eyes, and I wasn‚Äôt really dressing to impress that she was a photographer and that I had a really interesting, strong face that would look beautiful in pictures. With men, I‚Äôm always getting complementing on my height, curves, legs, eyes, or lips, so it was nice to hear something that wasn‚Äôt sexual. An ex had also once told me, that ‚Äúif I were going for looks, you definitely wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice‚Äù so... yeah... Also, with my female friends, I feel like they always compliment me on clothes, as I normally like to dress up, so physically that has been one of the more genuinely pleasant compliments that I have gotten. I really don‚Äôt like my picture taken because I struggle with being too self critical.

Personality wise, a guy that I had a vacation fling with once told me that I‚Äôm going to end up with a total nerd, and he told me that it would be hard for me to find someone who was simultaneously  attractive enough. He was/is an attractive, charismatic, intelligent, worldly, older, extroverted guy that everyone gravitates towards, so this has stuck for some reason..."
2246,In elementary school I had bangs (like all the time) and protruding ears. A boy on the bus said out loud that I looked like Jim Carey in Dumb and Dumber. Everybody on the bus laughed at me and my face turned red as well as my ears. Talk about a nightmare.
2247,"I didn't understand what it meant at the time because I was a little kid, but I was told by an friend of the family when I was 6-ish that I shouldn't play with legos or toy cars because I'd turn into a lesbian. It stuck with me because I didn't know what a lesbian was (I mean shit, I was only 6, how the fuck would I know), but I got a sense I was being insulted for my choice of toys, but only sudden death would tear me away from my precious legos so the comment from this person didn't change my behavior. For some reason I still remember that."
2248,"I was like 11 or 12 at the time. 
My mom was blow drying my hair when she held my face in the mirror and said, ""You're actually quite pretty, the only problem is that you're too chubby.""
Imo, I really love my mom and she was smiling in a lighthearted jesterly way when she said it but I still remember it to this day."
2249,That I can‚Äôt sing. I though I was okay lol guess not.
2250,"I was made fun of for my shapeless body 4th grade through high school, so.e even in my adulthood. I've been called flat, boney, skeletor, gross, not fun to look at... I still hate my body to this day, and there's nothing I can do to change it without expensive surgery."
2251,"Everyone laughs at my facial expressions. For years, lots of people have told me I have a ‚Äúhilarious‚Äù face."
2252,A guy I'm talking to finds me so beautiful that it makes me so happy. He told me yesterday that I'm the kind of girl that would make a fuck boy settle and it made me laugh a lot but man it boosted my confidence
2253,"When I was a teenager, a group of bystanders catcalled me for having big thighs. Even called me ""crispy pata (pig's leg)"". I haven't worn shorts nor skinny jeans since then."
2254,"I had Bell‚Äôs palsy when I was 14 so now my smile is crooked and I look weird when I smile or laugh. Had a guy mock my laugh and it really cut me down. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm an easily amused, giggly girl, so I can‚Äôt stop smiling and often don‚Äôt realise how bad I look till later ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2255,"I fluctuate weight all my life. When I was a teenager and lost 15 or so pounds my dad said ‚Äúwow you don‚Äôt have as many rolls as you used to.‚Äù Thanks dad, never forgot that one‚Ä¶"
2256,And my response has always been ‚ÄúNope!‚Äù with a smile
2257,"Very similar thing happened to me, but I took it as a compliment that I have enough confidence not to care. Goes hand in hand with my lazy soul."
2258,I love this.
2259,I DONT WANT TO BE A PIE
2260,I'm sorry but that's fucking hilarious
2261,"Those chickens are up to something....

# THEY ARE NOT ORGANIZED!"
2262,Someone said something similar about me probably 15 years ago now and I still see it when I look in the mirror sometimes
2263,Did you happen to make a tik tok and someone commented this...
2264,"On the positive side, my grandpa believes he can se auras and angels and such. When I finally started feeling better after those years of feeling depressed and having anxiety my life finally lightened up a bit and I got a bit happier and a lot less depressed. He told me, my aura had changed that it was now green and yellow and vibrant, not dark and dull like before. He was the first (and only one) who saw and acknowledged that I had gotten better."
2265,"Don't! I have the world's worst laugh--I either sound like a witch or like a white suburban dad wheezing--and people have commented on my laugh my entire life. I always find that the more I laugh, the more people I run into who love my laugh. The people that appreciate it will outweigh the ones that think it's a cool thing to tell someone their laugh sucks. It's a sound of joy. It doesn't have to be beautiful."
2266,There is a cold place in hell reserved for anyone that can see genuine joy and chooses to make someone self-conscious for it.
2267,"As someone who has done that before, I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you. When I did it, another  friend called me out on it. He said that a person‚Äôs laugh is an ultimate expression of their happiness, or something like that. That stuck with me- over 27 years now. I always come back to that when I find I‚Äôm getting annoyed with someone‚Äôs laugh. I hope you feel differently now."
2268,But you've got such a pretty face! ( shame about the rest of you is unsaid but implied)
2269,"Oh I got that as a 9 year old by an older family member (who has always been 350+ pounds!). It wrecked my self esteem for YEARS and even once I lost my baby fat and was at a normal, healthy weight range, it still affected me."
2270,"My ex's version was ""You'd be a ten if you went to the gym"""
2271,"Photos, especially if taken with a phone camera, tend to distort images a lot. It‚Äôs taking something 3D and making it 2D. Take a photo of a field or something and it usually doesn‚Äôt look as good as it does in person. It also doesn‚Äôt look authentically 3D, it looks flat.

Focal lengths can also affect how faces look. Here‚Äôs an example of this https://images.app.goo.gl/54spREUqaAUKdM7X9

Most phone/cheap cameras have lower focal lengths.

It helps with my self esteem too because I look horrible in selfies."
2272,Ouch
2273,strawberries are a very cute fruit :)
2274,Have you ever told your (now) husband about that? I'm curious as to what his reaction would be to this. Your ex sounds like a shitty person. I'm sorry his words stuck with you all these years. I bet you have a pretty nose! ‚ù§
2275,Nah sis ur nose is beautiful I haven't seen it but I just know. He was wrong it's pretty.
2276,[removed]
2277,That‚Äôs a great thing. Even better that someone acknowledged it.
2278,[removed]
2279,"Oh WOW! I am so very glad you‚Äôre doing well now. I can‚Äôt believe adults have the audacity to even think things like that when it comes to children (or anyone frankly) especially with knowing all they go through. It just really sucks that she decided to say it out loud. I am glad however, that you turned something so demeaning and hurtful into something that shapes who you are today, and that you feel confident about. People really need to learn, and teach kids manners, that is just so upsetting and I am soooo sorry! 
I do believe that your eyes are very beautiful though, even if I have not seen them. <3"
2280,Wow. His mother had no filter.
2281,"I remember being told something like this too. Turns out I‚Äôm not ugly, but it destroyed my self esteem throughout my teenage years as well. I HATED myself and thought boys would only like me if I promiscuous, so I was, and I hated myself more. So there I was, precocious, promiscuous, full of self loathing and wearing skinny jeans in a farming community in the early 2000‚Äôs. What a fucking disaster."
2282,I had the exact opposite issue where I was told that I was ‚Äúpretty but useless‚Äù. This was around age 11-12 and I‚Äôve never forgotten it and don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve completely healed from it. I have a serious issue with trusting my own intelligence
2283,"Oh man. This hit home and basically describes my teen years. I was called ugly multiple times, and it affected my self esteem when I was growing up. When the first guy really liked me, and it wasn't a joke, I was legitimately  shocked."
2284,"I remember I was getting on the bus and a random man getting on as well stopped and looked at me and said, ‚Äúwoah are you a model?! Why are you all dressed up like that?‚Äù I told him that‚Äôs just how I dress/look. Made me feel special üòÇ"
2285,wow that's just brutal
2286,"Yep, Asia is definitely one of the worst places to be dark-skinned."
2287,"It's so shitty for other people to judge your breast size. especially when parents do it. I mean it's like saying, I know i birthed you and all but I wish you'd come out slightly differently. That shit cuts to the bone, and then you grow up trying to compensate for it.
Sorry your mom did this, glad to hear you feel confident now."
2288,My mom said she would get me a nose job
2289,[removed]
2290,Wow. Another person with no filter. That was very rude of that lady.
2291,"It really bothers me how a lot of cultures highly value blue eyes or even eyes that aren‚Äôt brown over brown eyes. I‚Äôve had a friend say she hopes her son is born with blue eyes...she‚Äôs black and the father of her child is black. It‚Äôs so oddly and deeply rooted in cultures and communities and especially in ones where traits such as blue rarely exist. It‚Äôs sad, honestly."
2292,Don‚Äôt listen to anyone! Everyone is beautiful in their own way. There is no one way to be beautiful. I‚Äôm sure you have a lot of great qualities about yourself.
2293,"I don‚Äôt understand people who think saying whatever is on their minds is okay. I grew up with eczema all over my body and major allergies, and the shit adults would say to me as a child was absurd. I have no patience for that now and call people out when they act like idiots, especially with other people. Fuck ‚Äòem, they‚Äôre idiots. I know that doesn‚Äôt really help that much, but still. Fuck ‚Äòem."
2294,"There, there *pats you on the head*"
2295,"That was a bit offensive of him. He could have asked for your name. Dont take that personally. Every time that happens just dont blame yourself. Your girlfriends could have taken defense for you too. Or you could handle it with humor like ""girl in the middles name is so and so"" (+douche lol if his tone was offensive)"
2296,Your eyes sound beautiful actually! Very unique!
2297,Your eyes sound like mine. I just dont have the orange spot. But I have heterochromia too.
2298,They sound awesome.
2299,"The way men talk about other women when they're comfortable with you is often a good hint about how they'll talk about *you* when you make them angry. 

What an asshole. Glad you made something positive out of it, at least."
2300,I admire overgrown posteriors and cannot bear false witness.
2301,I'm so sorry. No one is like how he said. You are better than that comment!
2302,When I was 17 a bunch of dudes in my male-dominated gym class started commenting on my butt and generally harassing me and for years after I felt self-conscious about wearing tight clothing without a bag covering it
2303,"I have a big ass and at one point it was definitely my defining trait. It's beautiful, but these days only my husband compliments it."
2304,Wow. Just wow. :(
2305,"Used to get this all the time in high school/college. I was lucky enough to grow up in a pretty integrated area, had friends of all different races and no one really ever talked about skin color, but once all my friends started dating but I didn't, and then those comments started to follow up.... I put two and two together :/

Edit: clarity"
2306,"Same thing here, some people have told me i was a monkey because i have a lot of hair in my body, i can't seem to be able to forget that. i can't shave everything since it grows really fast and it ends up being quite useless, so i decided to do laser hair removal, i have some savings but i think it would not be enough, well... something is something i guess"
2307,I bet you those people are jealous of you! People direct their hate on others when they really are insecure about themselves.

2309,"my sister tells me this too, like will stop me in the middle of a sentence to tell me to ‚Äúchange your tone up‚Äù - it‚Äôs so annoying and it‚Äôs something i am very conscious about."
2310,That's so nice. :)
2311,"How silly is it tho that Asian women tend to strive for white skin even going as far as literally bleaching it sometimes and a heap of white women willingly risk skin cancer to have a tan. No one is happy with what they have. I think it's because people want to sell us products and stuff and they couldn't if we were happy with how we are so it's drilled into us from a young age from every angle of media and older generations. 

Not only do we not really have any control over how we look why should we care to? I'd never look at another white woman and think God she's so pale it's ridiculous. And I'm sure you wouldn't look at another woman and think she needed lighter skin to be pretty. But we look at ourselves and think that and that's rubbish. I hope I can raise my kids to have better self image than what I have."
2312,"I used to get that kind of comment about my face all the time. Average/fit body, but perpetually baby-faced."
2313,You'd be so beautiful if you stayed exactly the weight you are now.
2314,"K, but that picture looks delicious. 

I'm sorry your mom was so mean about your skin."
2315,You sound absolutely beautiful! I‚Äôve always admired feline facial features on other women.
2316,He just picked this from a list of things to make a person feel insecure about it. Don't give it another thought. If you focus on any feature it will start appearing larger/ weirder. Your mind is just distorting the image. He's a troll don't let him win.
2317,"Big foreheads are proud and elegant (I have one). Guess you dodged a bullet in that guy, huh?"
2318,Absolutely awful. HR are a bunch of muppets. :(
2319,Your uncles friend is a jerk.
2320,Your mom sounds like she was jealous of you. Horrible thing to say to your child.
2321,Aww your dad shouldn‚Äôt have opened his big mouth.
2322,"What a horrible thing to say! And what a terrible mindset, wtf."
2323,Pffft. I bet you AND your nose are drop-dead gorgeous.
2324,What the hell? Awful teaching ‚Äúskills.‚Äù  They should be ashamed of themselves.
2325,"I used to get that a lot too. Still do but now people tell me it goes with my aesthetic, which I guess is a compliment."
2326,Yea I had a pediatrician think something was wrong with me due to my dark under eyes. Nope just lost the genetic lottery on that one.
2327,"I can't believe that nobody has replied to this!

It's important to remember that all adjectives are subjective, so just because he said that does not mean that everyone thinks that. Those who sided with him probably got manipulated into doing so - after all, he manipulated you, so what was to stop him doing the same to them?

And the fact that you tried to make yourself perfect just shows how big your heart is, how much you care. One day, you will find the person who is just right for you, and they will be incredibly lucky to have you.

And one last thing - your recovery from that experience is amazing. Most people would be completely and utterly crushed, but you've said yourself that you're around much better people, so you're obviously more aware of your worth, of the type of people who deserve to be around you.

You've got this, Starfall9908. üòäüíó"
2328,Wow all those people sound shitty! Don‚Äôt listen to any of them. I bet you have a million amazing qualities about you. Focus on those!

2354,"She was, and thankfully my twenties are way nicer to me than my preteens and teens."
2355,"Thank you. It still happens all of the time, unfortunately. Even just this morning, although it's a lot harsher now. This morning I was told I was a ""fucking loser"". After my ex-husband said he wanted a divorce and the new friend I had made didn't really want to see me or talk anymore, he would say a lot of things like ""no wonder they left you"" or ""it's no wonder you have no friends"".

No. It's no wonder why I have no self esteem."
2356,He's a gem.
2357,Unfortunately that‚Äôs one of the least awful things he‚Äôs done
2358,I have slight buck teeth that I am really insecure about so when he told me that my heart dropped. I told my husband that and now he call me his little hamster lmao.
2359,"Yeah, I‚Äôm just glad this is such an inviting and loving environment for me too. And thank you as well, means a lotüòä"
2360,"Awww, thank you for the support. I really hope so! <3"
2361,Some of those cases are probably synesthesia. I experience that and see people as colors. Also scents or tastes or sounds sometimes. My mother is burgundy and purple and smells like mulled cider.
2362,"He's not as far as I know, he still drives without glasses so I really hope he has good vision... It's a very interesting fact though"
2363,"Oh yes, absolutely. I have big pores on my cheeks and nose (hereditary from mah momma lol) so I have to squeeze my blackheads pretty often. What are you gonna do. Hurt people hurt people, free people free people."
2364,Pretty shitty
2365,I am a lady quoting a meme sent to her by a man. I have a sizable backside.
2366,Oh my god I‚Äôm TOTALLY ugly in pictures but I find myself attractive In real life. So at least I have that going for me...haha
2367,"Damn. I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôll never understand parents who have kids then show them cruelty like this. Just heartbreaking. 
P.S, you‚Äôre fabulous. Screw them. And it‚Äôs NOT your fault. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2368,That‚Äôs really sad to know.
2369,Haha buck teeth are so cute! There are definitely worse animals to look like.
2370,"Interesting! The only thing i sense as something other than what it is, are games. Its almost like different video games have different smells to me. And i can only smell them when im playing. But they dont smell like anything other than themselves. Its hard to explain cause it drops into the same realm of impossibility as describing a color that is outside our realm of vision."
2371,I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre super cute in pictures too!
2372,"I don't think he necessarily wanted us. Moreso got stuck with us. My mom is an addict, so it wasn't safe to go with her. My dad didn't fail to remind us that we ruined his life. So, between my mom choosing drugs over us and my dad doing what he does best, it often feels like I shouldn't be here.

My ex-husband made me feel pretty loved and safe for a long time. I am thankful for that. But he grew in a different direction than me, and wanted something else for his life. I'm appreciative that after going through that exceptionally difficult part of my life, he still checks in to make sure I'm ok. 

Hopefully I'll find that again someday. It felt really nice to be loved while I was."
2373,Wow reddit is really coming through today. Making me feel good about myself :D Thank you!
2374,Thats fucking cool :0
2375,Aw thank you! :)
2376,Of course! :)
2377,"I really like Kate Spade bags for this. The feel of a designer bag, but they're constantly having 50-75% off sales plus Rakuten cash back offers. I snagged a $450 dollar bag for $120 (still not cheap, but worth it for something you're going to use 5 days out of the week). Current favorite is the large Evangelie."
2378,"I use the Pixie Mood Greta Work tote. I don‚Äôt take transit and also have a fairly heavy meeting schedule. This allows me to include my meeting documents in addition to having my laptop carried with me. 

I have never really been a bag person but least year was fed up with the standard issue laptop bag and made the purchase. I still get so many compliments on this bag. And bonus is it‚Äôs a great price. It wears great - I have never washed it and it looks almost new still. 

https://pixiemood.com/product/greta-work-tote-cloud/"
2379,"I know this isn't the most helpful answer but one of the reasons I swapped to a much smaller laptop was so I could fit it into existing bags I have. I carry a Surface Go around, it's the size of a large notebook and very light. I have a more dedicated work station at home and at the office, and I use OneDrive for keeping my documents available across all three of my devices."
2380,I use the rains backpack. It's massive and waterproof and I don't think it's too masculine.
2381,[This Kenneth Cole bag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FFF27NM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) but mine is red.
2382,"I use the [Hanover](https://www.loandsons.com/collections/sale/products/hanover-2-600d-recycled-poly-onyx) backpack from Lo and Sons. It‚Äôs not particularly stylish or svelte (at least IMO), but it‚Äôs not too big, is lightweight, lots of useful pockets, and has no logos. I tried totes and messenger bags for work for a time, but it was difficult to move quickly and uncomfortable on the shoulder. 

Also this backpack is so good as a travel backpack that I even got the larger size one for travel ü§£ because of the COVID situation they‚Äôre also doing an additional 15% off the sale that‚Äôs already going on."
2383,Dange Dover has good ones and there‚Äôs a ton on Poshmark.
2384,You should check out Dagne Dover
2385,"I'm curious to see some responses. Currently I use a generic mid-sized black [Swiss Army backpack](https://www.swissgear.ca/en/backpacks/swissgear-swa1456r-17-inch-computer-and-tablet-backpack-black) to carry all of my things to work. I do drive to work, but I take so many things to and from the office, having a bag with so much functionality allows me to eliminate the need to carry several different bags at once. Plus it's just black and goes with everything.

It could be more stylish, but it just works and is comfortable. I'd love to hear of some cute alternatives that function just as well."
2386,"It depends on how big your laptop is, but I use a Longchamp bag to carry my laptop. They are like the Tardis, bigger than you think, and can hold so much stuff!"
2387,"I have this https://www.eastpak.com/pt-en/backpacks-c120/london-sunday-grey-pEK77B363+00+999.html 
I think they come in different colours but I like the grey. Has a padded laptop pocket and a good amount of space. Plus I think the style is sophisticated and cuteeee."
2388,I use the [Crumpler Backpack](https://www.myer.com.au/p/crumpler-art-collective-2-med-backpack-black?istCompanyId=84873db0-394f-434b-8958-29526fe5f03c&istFeedId=3dd6959f-3482-45a5-8a47-313fef9bbe16&istItemId=iiapxqwti&istBid=t&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyuGF6cnE6AIVjqmWCh0fugFpEAQYEiABEgKPOfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) .The bag doesn‚Äôt look manly and the laptop shelf/rack/section has cushions which helps in alleviating some pressure from the shoulders.
2389,"I don't currently have a bag big enough to fit my laptop, but I have my eye on a backpack from the Notebook Therapy website."
2390,"This bag has a lot of room, and compartments. [Nursing Bag](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QP89RLR/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_zf1GEb37T6925)"
2391,I have a [Rareform](https://www.rareform.com/) backpack that I love!
2392,"I have a Kate spade Laurel Way Jaelyn and it is the BEST bag I‚Äôve ever owned. It has a dedicated padded laptop pocket in the middle, allowing you to put things on either side for organization, a zipper pocket, and the standard 2 pockets for phones and accessories. I use it daily. Straps long enough for a shoulder, short enough that I can carry it by the handle and it doesn‚Äôt hit the floor. Handles fold down so you can easily get in and get what you want."
2393,"I have this in silver: [https://poshmark.com/listing/Calvin-Klein-Florence-flap-backpack-black-silver-5cf18c628d653d616f670276](https://poshmark.com/listing/Calvin-Klein-Florence-flap-backpack-black-silver-5cf18c628d653d616f670276)

I got it on clearance and I'm obsessed with it. I have a chromebook that fits in perfectly and it has so many compartments! I'm all about having random things in my bag for ""just in case"" situations (e.g. band-aids, tampons, dry shampoo, lipstick) and I still have room to spare. Plus, backpack = free hands.

If I were going for something more professional, I'd have to say Kate Spade."
2394,A backpack. Which backpack depends on which laptop I'm using.
2395,"I'm hoping to get a laptop in the near future, but I just recently bought [this backpack on Amazon.] (https://www.amazon.com/Lekesky-Backpack-Stylish-Computer-Repellent/dp/B07L83N78Q/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8&aaxitk=blqHq1G0P6u5YNzJulc9ww&hsa_cr_id=5113015930401&ref_=sb_s_sparkle) 

There's a few different brands in this style (Himawari is another brand I was interested in) and very durable!"
2396,I use the work issued back pack now but I have used a Matilda the musical satchel and a Harry Potter satchel in  the past. Some nappy bags might work too.
2397,I use designer backpacks. Either this one when I don't have to carry much besides my laptop: [https://alexmonhart.com/art-01-backpack-polished-black](https://alexmonhart.com/art-01-backpack-polished-black) (can also be converted into a clutch). Or this one: [https://www.pinqponq.com/en/cubik-medium-grey-melange-dlx](https://www.pinqponq.com/en/cubik-medium-grey-melange-dlx) when I need to carry more stuff.
2398,"My time has come! So I had a HUGE issue with this about a year ago when I started bike commuting, add all the problems you listed PLUS I wanted it to be a pannier for my rear rack on my bike. After months of looking, I came across [po campo](https://www.pocampo.com/collections/all-products) who has few but great options. They do cater to biking folk but they have a couple plain backpacks. They have ones with and without pannier attachments and laptop sleeve options. I have the Irving backpack in black and its super stylish and relatively compact but still fits my work laptop (15"" screen). I actually use it for work travel (with no bike) because I love it so much and the bike attachment does not get in the way at all. They have some really fun prints but my dress code business/professional so I stuck with black. They also have a ""Belmont"" backpack that doesnt have any kind of bike attachment."
2399,I love my Sandqvist backpack. Another great choice is a classic Longchamp tote or the classical Michael Kors tote
2400,"I currently use a backpack, I've occasionally used a denim purse with my then laptop's sleeve in it as a laptop bag as well (I used to have a 13 inch laptop, but that doesn't work with my 17 inch one now)"
2401,"I‚Äôve used my work-issued Swiss Army backpack forever, which was great and held a lot, but I wanted something dressier. I bought the Kaya backpack from Calpak to fit my laptop and some other essentials. They‚Äôre very sleek and professional looking, plus great for travel. Can‚Äôt wait to take mine back out again once quarantine‚Äôs over!"
2402,Checkout Bellroy.
2403,"Anything from Matt & Nat is super cute! Vegan brand and they‚Äôre really pretty.

I personally use the Brave backpack."
2404,"Mine probably looks quite silly, but I use a white and gold sparkly bag from Victoria's Secret. My mom got it for free and gave it to me. It has a zipper so my laptop won't fall out."
2405,"I have a Reaction by Kenneth Cole laptop bag I got on clearance from Macys a few years ago, still looks new!"
2406,I got a black work backpack from amazon. They have super cute options and it doesn‚Äôt break my back while commuting!
2407,I don't carry a laptop with me but my Kipling Osho has a laptop compartment and I just love this backpack. It's super comfortable and the quality is great. I'll probably use it forever. I have the really black one with all black metallic details (and a red plushie heart keychain attached to it haha).
2408,"Depends on circumstances. There are a LOT of options if you're not really set on high fashion.  
But one of my staples is a leather laptop briefcase style bag.  Those look much more stylish than your average nylon laptop bag. I got mine from a sale bin because it had a funky colour, which was a plus for me. Looks professional, too, and classic leather never goes out of style.  Coach Charlie Brief, Cluci Leather Laptop Briefcase, things like that.

Personally I dislike tote bag style because I can't carry the weight well with the narrow handle straps. So a wide straps ot two for me, whatever style."
2409,"I use [this one](https://www.dagnedover.com/collections/weston-laptop-bag). Its pretty unisex, not bulky, and super organized which I love"
2410,I use the Dagne Dover Signature tote in the size Legend. It‚Äôs totally worth the $$. I‚Äôve never had a bag that was so well designed for organization.
2411,Black backpack with thick straps to hold my laptop. It's cute and has gold metal details too but is practical.
2412,"I use a Tumi Voyageur Mauren tote bag in solid black. The Tumi brand is designed for working women, so they have a variety of good, sturdy bags with a lot of utility."
2413,"Hello, hello! I recommend a classic Kate Spade black tote for style; however, it will wear easily day-to-day especially with travel or if the client doesn't have adequate storage space (I prefer to not place my belongings on the ground and on a clean surface to extend the life and for respect purposes). For comfort and practicality, I highly recommend a simple yet efficient North Face backpack that is guaranteed quality and can tolerate day-to-day wear and tear. So many pockets!"
2414,I refuse to use a tote but I love my Timbuktu backpack (got in on sale for 60 dollars). I also have a leather backpack I got in Italy for interviews and more formal occasions.
2415,Black backpack from Lululemon. I love it.
2416,"I‚Äôm cheap and won‚Äôt spend a ton, but need a good quality backpack. Shoulder bags kill my neck and throws off my alignment.  I got this on Amazon and love it. Im also very minimalist in looks and don‚Äôt accessorize much on purpose. 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LY3QXGP/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_vu3GEbEPFCSKW"
2417,I have a LV Laptop bag that was a gift that I adore.
2418,I have a Kipling backpack for my laptop. Good for traveling as well. The brand also have other styles (tote or messenger) for laptop if you don‚Äôt prefer the backpacks.
2419,"Matt & Nat have some fun options. I have a backpack that fits a 13‚Äù laptop and sort of a clutch that fits the laptop that has a strap. Both are very sturdy and easy to style. 

Kate Spade has nice laptop bags as well (as many ladies above have said!)."
2420,"I use the CalPak Kaya Laptop Backpack. It‚Äôs super comfortable to carry around, and cute yet professional. Highly Recommend."
2421,"Best investment yet!

My last Samsonite bag lasted 5 years and I only got this one because I earn bit more money now and wanted something a bit more professional looking. It took them years to come out with something that fit my huge laptop so when they did I jumped at it!

2422,"I use laptop bags from Forever New. They‚Äôre decent quality, they‚Äôre very affordable when they go on sale,  they‚Äôre professional enough to carry to work but still cute. I‚Äôve carried my laptop around a lot in these bags, including while travelling. They also have plenty of other pockets and sleeves, which I love!"
2423,"I use this amazing bag that I got online. It has a laptop sleeve, a separate lunch compartment, and is big enough to fit books, gym stuff, etc. I have the tote, but there‚Äôs also a backpack option. [Game Changer Tote](https://www.buffbunny.com/collections/shop-all/products/game-changer-bag-shadow)"
2424,"I started out with a Fjall Raven but it was too small. I travel between schools and need to carry my laptop, charger, a binder, a couple books/notebooks, etc. I found this [backpack from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DHJL26Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and it's been great so far! It has huge pockets for my water bottle and coffee cup and the top has a frame in it so it stays open."
2425,"I use a Fjallraven K√•nken Laptop! It‚Äôs comfortable, waterproof and has a special padded pocket to protect the laptop."
2426,"Dagne Dover, JEMMA, and Cuyana are great if you're thinking of going higher-end. Kate Spade purses are awesome and very inexpensive, relatively-speaking, but I found that Dagne Dover just had more tidiness to it. When I'm going from work straight to my exercise studio, it helps to be able to store a water bottle, shoes, and gym clothes in my bag. :)"
2427,"I use this backpack from Sword & Plough: 

https://www.swordandplough.com/collections/backpacks/products/signature-urban-ruck-blue

I‚Äôve had it for nearly three years and I absolutely love it. Plenty of room, classic look, and it supports a good cause. I get compliments on it all the time. Good luck with your search!

Edit: I should note that they have some great messenger bags too, the backpack just suits my needs best."
2428,Swiss Army Backpack
2429,I just put it in my purse. Most of my bags are big enough to hold my laptop
2430,"I switch between a brown leather tote I‚Äôve had for a few years now and a Cotopaxi Tasra backpack. It‚Äôs not exactly professional as it‚Äôs colorful af. But I really like all the organization compartments inside of it.

But I also downsized my 15‚Äù laptop to a Surface Pro and it‚Äôs made my life much easier."
2431,"I have a Matt & Nat Annex backpack that is super sleek and ‚Äòprofessional‚Äô looking. I also have a fjallraven that is the typical super cute, feminine looking pack with a laptop sleeve. Fits my surface perfectly."

I pre-ordered this bag after an extensive search for a stylish work bag that could easily convert from a tote to a backpack.  Note that it only fits laptops up to 13"".  I can't wait to receive it and start using it daily.  Prices shown are not USD, it worked out to about $150 USD when I purchased it.  Which is more money than I've ever spent on any sort of bag, but I think it's worth investing in the items we use the most.  I love how simple and classic the design is, with minimal branding, and the mechanism behind the straps converting is the cleverest solution I've seen."
2433,Dagne Dover has a lot of really cute purses with laptop compartments
2434,"I used to use the backpack made by the Swiss Army Knife company when I was at uni. Black/grey and probably masculine, but I loved it. It was massive and fit everything into it, but didn't scream ""I'm a laptop bag!"""
2435,A pink book bag. My shoulders hurt if I use any kind of one strap shoulder bag.
2436,"big fan of my tumi backpack. and i got it at the outlet so it wasn‚Äôt as expensive (although still a bit steep). had it for a over year now and it still looks brand new, sleek, and stylish. also doesn‚Äôt hurt my back or shoulders like a tote does, but is still sleek looking for a backpack"
2437,"A black backpack I got from Walmart for $20! 

Love it haha"
2438,"I love Dagne Dover's stuff! I have a duffel, tote, and backback. They are stylish, compartments are so thoughtful, and will keep you so organized!"
2439,"I was carrying a dagne dover, loved it for the laptop sleeve, organization and water bottle holder but I started carrying my lunch to work and working out more so I switched to an Osprey Nova so I can carry less bags and have a nice looking wallet/clutch I can pull out for networking/meetings where I need to hold business card, phone and keys."
2440,I carry a Louis Vuitton neverfull tote (size mm) with a felt organizer insert. They come with a wristlet so if I'm just running out real quick I keep my wallet and keys in that. Otherwise the tote is my everyday bag.
2441,"You didn't mention your budget. Have you checked out Tumi? I used to use a fancy Tumi backpack. It was feminine and sleek. Then I got bored with it and switched to a Timbuktu backpack with my company logo on it. Now, I don't use one at all because I'm laid off. Womp womp!"
2442,"Betsy Johnson weekender bags tend to be big enough for a laptop, a couple binders, books, a pencil case, and a makeup bag (which sometimes even comes with the bag!!!)."
2443,"I use a huge Kate Spade tote. Literally feels like Hermione Granger‚Äôs extension spell bag! Fits everything I need, and still looks nice."
2444,"I second Kate Spade! I have the Cameron tote, they come in lots of colour options, definitely work-friendly. Love it too since the brand is professional but not designer-flashy."
2445,I was also going to suggest Kate Spade
2446,I have a kate spade work tote I got in super sale for like $100! It has a middle pocket that is padded for a laptop and the rest is big enough I use use it as my purse!
2447,i also suggest kate spade!!
2448,Rakuten? Is this a way to save moolah I haven‚Äôt heard of yet?
2449,"They have a 75% off sale running now!  Not sure if any laptop bags were included, but you can access it via Facebook."
2450,"Definitely second Kate Spade. I‚Äôve had mine for years and I have even carried it as a purse at times. It still looks the same as the day I bought it.

They have a 70% off sale a few times a year if you sign up for their e-mails."
2451,"Um this is exactly what I have been looking for. I've looked for ages - thank you! I can finally ditch my work issued clunky laptop bag.

Seriously - thank you so much for this suggestion!

Edit: Do you mind if I ask what color you have?"
2452,"If they'd made that in a 15"" size, I would've sprung for it! But alas. My laptop is unfashionably large."
2453,"I also love my Swiss Army Bagpack. I generally like to over pack, but I have many people told me that my bag is bagger than me haha

Now I primary use Anello Bagpack. Doesn't have many compartment but turn out I never needed that many. 

On day I don't need to carry thing as many thing I use Ecosusi bow briefcase. Mostly because it is super cute."
2454,"Le Pliage tote? I have the crossbody one, it's definitely bigger on the inside!"
2455,"Seconding Longchamp. The Le Pliage large tote is so versatile, sturdy, and chic!"
2456,"https://notebooktherapy.com/collections/backpacks/products/pastel-tofu-backpack?variant=18167065051251

This one to be exact"
2457,"Me too! I have the Brooklyn backpack. It's great, I commute by bike half the year and it's super waterproof, durable, and big enough for everything I need. Plus it's got a separate pocket for a laptop - pretty standard, except it ALSO has a side zipper that accesses just that compartment. Extra amazing going through airport security, I don't need to dig out my laptop, I can just slide it out the side!"
2458,"Yes! I travel a lot for work and saw that like, every professional woman in her 30s had a backpack with a framed opening. After reviewing all the similar options on Amazon, I went with the [Lily & Drew version](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W5R88S5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

1. It was important to me for it to be plain black. 

2. That model had the most pockets.

I've only had it a couple of months, and have been on fewer plane trips than usual, but I love it. It's big enough it can hold my laptop, kindle, switch, giant noise-cancelling headphones, Turtl pillow, powerpack, cables, etc. 

It has a little pocket at the front top that's billed as a ""cellphone pocket"". It was too small for that, for me, but I have lots of random bits and bobs in there (keys, earplugs, gum, chapstick...). It has a small pocket on the back which is perfect for protcting my passport. 

I love that bag b/c it has a place for everything and everything in its place. When I'm flying, I have all my little niceties. On a day-to-day basis, it is convenient to carry. It just helps me feel so equipped for life, and I think it looks pretty sleek (much moreso than my [previous bag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G96LT1T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)). 

I am concerned about long-term durability, but I've carried a laptop daily for 5.5 years, and this is far-and-away my fave of the 4 laptop bags I've tried out in that time period."
2459,"This is so cute, thanks!"
2460,"I'm considering a Samsonite one, but haven't decided which one yet. They are simply amazing quality!"
2461,"It used to be called Ebates. It's a completely free service, you create an account, add the widget to your internet browser tool bar, and whenever you're on a participating website (and almost everywhere participates) a notification comes up alerting you to the current cash back deal they're offering for anything you purchase from the website at that time.  If you end up purchasing something they track the cash back and will mail you a check quarterly with your earnings. Completely free money on things you were going to buy anyway."
2462,"Keep in mind that, like any free service, Rakuten makes their money by selling your information."
2463,"I bought the grey and I love it. During the fall winter they bring it in with a slightly deeper grey that I‚Äôm probably even more obsessed with but I do not regret my purchase!!

I should add I think it‚Äôs ‚Äúcloud‚Äù but they change their colours just a touch every year. It may have had a different name last year but looks very similar!"
2464,"The [Hanover Deluxe](https://www.loandsons.com/pages/discover-hanover-deluxe-2-laptop-backpack) should fit a 15""!"
2465,Thanks! I‚Äôm gonna check it out!
2466,Thank you! Cloud was the color I was looking at. Just ordered it - thank you again for posting about this!
2467,"Yay and also Boo! When did that come out? I was looking in January and I swear they didn't have a 15"" version!"
2468,I‚Äôm so happy that it was useful!! I hope you like it as much as I do üòä
2469,"They've had the Deluxe size for a long time - they just switched to the ""Hanover 2"" line recently (the old version didn't have a separate zippered laptop compartment, just a sleeve on the inside of the main compartment) so maybe you caught them when they were out of the old line before introducing the new one?"
2470,"I'm civil, tolerant and respectful. I mind my own business and avoid being around them and interacting too much. Conflict is something I steer away from and if things are headed that way, I'm diplomatic and try to deflect, if it doesn't work, I just leave."
2471,"I‚Äôm cordial unless I‚Äôm provoked. I can only think of a couple of people currently that I dislike enough to avoid or ignore. I‚Äôm a genuinely expressive person and I can‚Äôt control my face, so people can usually tell if I‚Äôm not warm to them."
2472,"I'll try to reduce any interaction I have with them, but keep it civil. I also keep an open-mind about things, I'm generally quite a trusting person and it takes a lot for me to decide I don't like someone."
2473,"Politely, professionally, impersonally, and only as needed."
2474,"Look busy. Go toilet, keep conversations short"
2475,"I'd say it's best to stay nice and ""professional"". Though I personally would limit the conversations as much as possible. People usually take the hint themselves..."
2476,"Minimize contact where possible and be polite yet minimal with them. If it's a co-worker, I'm strictly professional with them."
2477,I‚Äôm usually very talkative and friendly but when I‚Äôm around people I don‚Äôt like I‚Äôm quiet.
2478,I just try to ignore them and be blunt because I don‚Äôt have time for people I don‚Äôt like
2479,"I'd say it's best to stay nice and ""professional"". Though I personally would limit the conversations as much as possible. People usually take the hint themselves..."
2480,I have a history of being really good friends with girls who didn't like me so remain open minded
2481,"I outright ignore them unless I have no other choice. If I have to interact with them, I'm coldly civil."
2482,ill keep it calm and civil until they don‚Äôt probably. then its time to ignore completely
2483,I just ignore them.
2484,"The straw that broke the camel's back was being blamed for the marital problems she had when I was a kid. Like, no, you married a man who didn't want kids when you already had three and then spent your entire marriage chipping away at his self esteem whilst trying your hardest to bounce on someone else's genitals - that probably had more to do with it than me being a bogstandard teenager.

My only regret is not doing it sooner."
2485,"When I realised I was an emotional punching bag for her to vent on, and that she was using 'blood is thicker than water' and 'but I have good intentions' as ways to justify her behavior. And also realising that if things stayed the same, I would never be able to grow or self-actualize.

After I drew firm lines and left, I did my best to fix things, especially since I knew a lot of her behavior was the result of her divorce. She'll never change though - any time she comes close to introspection, she absolutely panics and also tends to refuse to meet halfway on anything.

I don't regret it - I do feel bad for my sister though, who stuck by her side. It caused a pretty big rift between us, because in her eyes, I was merely being selfish and not respecting our parent. Now that time has gone on and she's bourn the brunt of my mother's unchecked behavior, I think she understands a bit better. We're as close as we could be given that I live on another continent now."
2486,"When I realized she's a narcissist. Last straw was about a year ago when I tried to explain to her (again) that I don't want her to talk about her boyfriend because it triggers my mental health problems (caused by growing up with her, him and their abuse).

She blew up at me how I'm crossing HER boundaries by telling her what she can or can't talk about and that I am hurting HER. I realized I'm done with everything always being about her. 

I've been in no-contact with her since then and I'm very happy about this decision."
2487,"It was a long journey to realising that but the final straw was when she lied to me about needing money for 'essentials' which I 'lent' her and she promptly blew on a totally unnecessary motorcycle. And then she tried to guilt me about it saying that she wouldn't have done that if I had just gifted her a motorcycle anyway! That was in my first year of working and I had given her all of my measly savings (I was a teacher then!). She didn't pay me back (not surprising, I wasn't expecting her to).

I don't regret not fixing it at all. It's been one of the best things I've done for my mental health."
2488,When she didn‚Äôt respect me in my own home.  No because it‚Äôs her that needed to fix the relationship and if she chose to let her pride prevent her from doing so then nothing would change anyway.  I don‚Äôt regret cutting her out of my life at all.
2489,She's a judgemental  cruel person who emotionally abuses people for fun - I don't regret cutting her out of my life one bit.
2490,"When I realized that she was never going to change and would always be an abusive narcissist. I waiting way too long to cut her out of my life. 

Why would I regret it? She's the one who made zero effort to address the situation. No, she was perfect and beautiful and never did anything wrong.

I only regret that I didn't do it 30 years ago."
2491,"there's nothing *good* there, you know? people who choose to reconcile with their parents often can find a little glimmer in their memories, a period of time when there was a genuine connection and things were good. i draw a complete blank every time.

phone calls with her started feeling like being forced to put my life on hold for 2 hours to entertain a stranger and her delusional fantasy that we have some kind of bond. i couldn't do it anymore. 

the decision was finalized the last time i called, she thought she hung up, and i listened to her say things so heartless and awful that i can't even remember them. i called back and said i heard everything. first i heard wrong, then it was the TV (spoken by a character in the show, about a daughter with my name, going through similar things in her life), then when that failed came the blubbering and sorry's she didn't mean. i was filled with disgust and just faded."
2492,"When I realized that I can never do anything quite good enough, and that I myself am not quite good enough for her. When I realized that it isn't my hobbies or interests that she isn't all that interested in, but *me specifically*.

She got drunk and grilled my husband a few times on why my relationship with her is so poor and he just straight up told her ""because x, y, and z."" She's been putting in a lot more effort the last several years but the damage is done, honestly, and I don't try anymore. I haven't cut her out of my life, I just gave up on the idea of having anything beyond a casual friendship with her and have been a lot happier that way."
2493,When she chose to go back to my abusive dad again. Their relationship is so toxic and they just feed each other's crazy behavior. I couldn't watch it anymore so I cut them both off. I'm better off
2494,I'm not close to my mother. I don't mind her in my life. But no need so close. We just do not have an emotional connection.
2495,"Our relationship had always been rocky over the years but what finally did it for me is when she told me she'd rather see me turning to prostitution to fund myself than put a penny towards me going to university away from home.

Haven't spoken to her in over two and a half years and my only regret is not being able to do it sooner. The woman never deserved to have children and I have zero plans to get back in contact."
2496,"Long story short, my mom went overseas for work (still does) she met my stepdad and decided they were gonna get married after only four months, told my dad about this (they were still married) and lied to me and my little brother about this. She talked to him while we were driving home from a Mommy/Daughter day. That lead to like one to two and half years of blaming her for my issues, self harm (I'm clean, have been clean threeish years now!), and suicidal ideation. She's also a raging narcissist. I'm not old enough to cut her out my life completely, but I'm trying to distance myself."
2497,Whoa. Are you my sibling?
2498,Lost weight
2499,Lost 20lbs and stopped drinking so much.

2525,"Last year my brother went around my parent's house and replaced all the photos of me with photos of my celebrity doppelganger. He even went as far as to photoshop her face over mine in the group photos. 

Apparently it took my parents embarrassingly long to notice."
2526,"Back when my brother and I both lived with our parents I poured a jar of nailpolish onto a piece of wax paper with the brush and bottle laying in the puddle so it was an obvious spill, let it dry, then cut the excess paper and put it on his laptop keyboard. The whole family heard him scream from the other side of the house when he found it. üòÇ Could be put on anything important to them and relatively flat, just make sure it really is dry!"

Unless they're essential services, especially doctors/nurses please don't prank them, hug them instead and make their favorite meals), then it's harmless because they're washing up anyway."

2534,"If you can access their keys: park their car somewhere different, like at the end of the driveway instead of close to the house, or one parking space over from where they left it. Just enough to make them stop and think about it, especially if they're typically the only one who drives it. Also, move the mirror and/or seat slightly so it feels off to them but they can't quite pinpoint why.

Also, look for a conditioner (and maybe shampoo) that says it adds volume for your particular type of hair (I have fine hair, so often use these types of products instead of my regular shampoo and conditioner.  That's not adding an additional hair product."
2579,"If you use conditioner, make sure it isnt too heavy and you don't use too much. To much of the wrong conditioner can really weigh your hair down"
2580,"You can use metal hairdressing clips (check amazon) at the part if you want to air dry. Just put them in at your part, parallel to your head if that makes sense, and it‚Äôll dry with the hair lifted a bit. It gives a little more volume in that area, instead of your hair weighing it down while it dries."
2581,"What works for me is to tie it into a high ponytail (not too tight of course) after I've washed it. My hair dries very quickly, and when I let it down, it has a lot of volume. I have thin hair too."

2583,"Not sure if you‚Äôd count this as a product but Shampoo with sea salt in it. Lush has one called big that is ah-mazing. 

Absolutely product free would be blow drying it upside down, using a round brush for a blow out or some sort of Velcro or hot roller. But even that would look and hold better with volumizer, heat protectant and hair spray."

something like this. I bought one off alibaba for $23.00 and have never turned back! no sticky hair products, easy, fast and lasts for days until your next hair wash. best find last year :)"
2588,"I was going to say that.

:D

Voluminous minds think alike."
2589,This.
2590,"I am jealous of people who can do this. Mine is flat within minutes. It's bad enough that when I used to try to curl it with an iron and hair spray, the first curls would be flat by the time I finished curling the last pieces of straight hair."
2591,"I do this every night. It has also made it possible to grow longer, because it gets less damaged."
2592,I‚Äôll try this out! üòÅ
2593,"Try braiding your hair - it won't make it curly, but at least it won't be flat. Make one or several of [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_braid#Variations) in your hair before going to bed. Preferably while your hair is a bit damp (but not too wet)."
2594,Doesn't work for more than a few minutes. Tried many times.
2595,Hmm... Your hair must really like being flat.
2596,Yeah it drives me crazy. Same with one of my old stylists who loved volumous hair styles. The only benefit is that air-drying is a fast and painless process.
2597,"In a way. Happened in middle school -- I didn't realize at all, I thought we were just cool, until she randomly dropped one day that she became anorexic in an attempt to look more like me. I tried to convince her to stop but I'm not sure it had any effect. We grew apart in high school.

That shit still haunts me. I know it's not my fault, but still. I see her posts on Facebook sometimes and she struggles severely with a TON of mental health issues, I just wish I hadn't inspired at least one of them."
2598,"Some months ago I had a new colleague trying to be ""best friends forever"" after about a week. I started hanging out with her less, I made sure to go to lunch with different people every day. She latched on different person pretty soon."
2599,"A couple times that happened to me with female friends, I ended both friendships, there was really no other option. I stayed cordial with them from afar, one continuously tried to cause issues for me afterwards but never prospered. It also happened to me with a male friend, that friendship also ended and very bizarrely."
2600,"I was the obsessive friend. She never informed me i was obsessive but one day we were supposed to go to the store together and i stopped to talk to our teacher and she ended up leaving without me. I texted her but she never answered, naturally i texted a bunch more over the course of the week and even made a facebook post about her (this was in in 10th grade ü§£). She completely ghosted me. I basically talked trash to anyone that would listen because i was upset she didnt like me. I even made up in my mind that she was a lesbian because i needed a reason on why it was her fault not mine.  At the time i was way to pissy and niave to be embarrassed about it but looking back it was super cringy. I have creeped her facebook once since and she is doing very well but ive never contacted her."
2601,"Not me, but my best friend had this happen with one of our mutuals. I'll call my friend Lauren and the mutual Jane.

In high school, Lauren brought Jane into our friend group b/c she was kinda an outcast (she was kinda an awkward, theatre nerd, insanely smart, horse girl). B/c of this, I guess Jane kinda imprinted on her and by sophomore year had the most insane, stalk-y, uncomfortable crush on Lauren. She would take photos of her without Lauren knowing, write love poems and notes for her birthday, bribed her by getting her tickets to Adele, front row, and would always act super ""seductive"" around her (lobster posing, ""dropping"" things only to bend over and pick them up slowly, moaning while she stretched). She would always try to invite Lauren to trips to the museum and the mall, and Lauren would always last minute extend the invite to me to avoid the 1 on 1. It was super awkward. It ended pretty ugly.

Senior year, Jane made Lauren agree to a ""pact"" that they wouldn't apply to the same colleges (which was really stupid), so when Lauren got into a really good school that Jane didn't, Jane threw an actual fit and shit on her behind her back to one of our other mutual friends (it's worth noting also that right around this time Lauren was seeing a guy, which made Jane even more furious). Of course, the friend told Lauren and given that in conjunction with the past few years of putting up with her shit, Lauren finally broke off the friendship entirely and Jane literally sulked for the last 3 months of high school, making it very obvious to everyone that she was upset. Pretty ugly stuff.

Since then time has passed and they put a lot of the bad blood behind them and are relatively on good terms, but I still think Jane has a thing for her and it's still a little toxic.

(BTW, although the romantic stuff was a major element, they also remained friendly during most of high school, as well. Lauren didn't want the romantic element to dictate the friendship, but the whole thing basically ended when Jane did something shitty to Lauren having to do with something platonic, not the crush.)

&#x200B;

TL;DR: One of my friends became obsessed with my best friend, and it created a toxic friendship which ended in back stabbing and a loss in respect."
2602,"this guy was friends with me for a while, thought he was cool but he turned out to be a little... mercurial lets say. he wanted to hang out one night so we were listening to records at his house, he says he‚Äôs hungry and asks to get food. i  said how i didn‚Äôt have any money on me but i dont mind going with him if he wants to get something for himself, he‚Äôs insists on going to a pricey burger place. when dropping me off, he locked the car doors and tried to profess his love to me. i guess he was jealous i started seeing someone and thought he was entitled to me because he insisted on buying me dinner. he then talked a bunch of shit because he was hurt by the rejection lol. he was talking shit to his best friend who i had previously rejected twice while in a long term relationship he knew about. great guys!

-edit: i didnt see the descrip, i dont know if it didnt load or if the post was edited but all i saw was the question being asked and a post about a guy below lol sorry"
2603,"It was edited! Every time I tried to leave an example of what I meant, my post got taken down for ‚Äúbeing about a specific person‚Äù üòí
I apologize and appreciate your story regardless."
2604,My job
2605,Im thankful because this whole thing has forced people including me to see what life is like without the weight of our daily regimes. Its kinda given me a new perspective on life. Ive been doing things that ive been meaning to do in years. I would always tell myself that i didn't have the time for those things but now that i have actually done them ive realized I actually did have the time for them. And that makes me happy. Dont get me wrong this thing sucks ass but not entirely.
2606,That my mortgage was paid off a couple of years ago.
2607,"Sharing home cooked meals with my wonderful boyfriend instead of hurried breakfast, lunch at work, and takeout dinner."
2608,I'm thankful I'm an introvert with many hobbies. I'm actually having a great time in quarantine!
2609,"I am thankful that my family and friends are safe and healthy. I‚Äôm thankful for all the healthcare workers who have been the brave warriors in these tough times. And I am also thankful for the mailmen, bus drivers, pilots, market workers, and generally anyone who have made our lives a bit easier even though the times are hard."
2610,"A roof over my head, food in the house, adequate toilet paper, and a wage still coming in. And cat cuddles. My boyfriend is very easy going too which is helping in the madness."
2611,The amount of daylight I get in my current home.
2612,"Health, partner, family, friends, job. Also grateful for my savings."
2613,"Unlimited paid sick leave. I‚Äôm a first responder and thankfully haven‚Äôt had to use it yet for this, but at least I know if I do get sick I won‚Äôt have to worry about bills or not getting paid."
2614,"The internet, good weather, and people performing random acts of kindness to help others."
2615,My job and my circle of friends and family. The world's going crazy but I've never felt any pressure or worries.
2616,That I can afford to stay at home with my child and cut the social contact to the absolute minimum.
2617,My fiance. My cat. My house. My job. I'm in a really fortunate position.
2618,Everything and everyone in my life.
2619,The internet and the fact that Houston is such a spread out city.  Makes it easy to socially distance.
2620,"I'm thankful most people in my dad's side of the family all live somewhat close to one another. At a time when we can only leave the house for short walks around our area or going to the grocery store (if you're not still working somewhere deemed essential), it's a blessing to be able to call my aunts and uncles and cousins and grandma and have them come to the balcony and see them. We were always at each other's houses and hanging out, so this has been really difficult. Being able to see them face to face, even from many floors up, has been great and, frankly, the highlight of my day when I can drop by to see them or when they drop by to see me."
2621,That my husband is working from home. Found out I‚Äôm pregnant with baby 2 just a few days before lockdown and boy am I sick. I‚Äôm basically useless. Thank god for husbo.
2622,"I live in a different province than my parents and all of my siblings, but knowing that they are thinking of me and worried for me just as much as I am them makes my heart a little warmer. I'm thankful for their emotional support when I need to rant, stress, and be sad about what's happening. I can't wait to be able to go home and see them face to face again."
2623,My family and my dogs.
2624,"My job. I still have it. 

That no one I know and love have fallen ill to this virus

And ice cream."
2625,Having a house
2626,"I am thankful I have a place to stay with my family, and my two cats"
2627,"Video games, my husband and our cat. The ability to grocery shop online and have it delivered to our door."
2628,Student loan payments being paused for six months. Also having a job. Even though being a nurse right now is going to be (it hasn't hit my province THAT hard yet) rough.
2629,"Being able to travel to my parents' home before the lockdown. I live alone, and I'd go insane if I'd have to stay at my flat. My mum is a GP, and she's under the risk, but I am grateful to spend this period with my family. Also, if she gets sick, I'd want to be with her until she gets better."
2630,Secure employment (I‚Äôm a hospital librarian) and student loans being paused interest-free for six months.
2631,"All the time my spouse and I are able to spend together, as well as my regular paycheque and video games."
2632,"In all honesty, social media. It's been a great tool to keep me connected to friends and fam across the world."
2633,"To have an amazing boyfriend and friends. It‚Äôs already weird and lonely being in the house all day everyday, but I think I‚Äôd be a lot more miserable if I couldn‚Äôt talk to my support system and speak about happier times. It‚Äôs still a little rough though because one of my best friends‚Äô mom is a doctor and we‚Äôre worried about her going to work. But even with that, I‚Äôm thankful she continues going to work even though it puts her at risk"
2634,"Where i live. The govt. Is doing a decent job so far keeping the economy going while keeping people safe. (This may change upon reflection) I  have good free access to medical care if needed. On a more local scale it's easy for me to isolate, social distance while still being in a decent range of hospitals."
2635,"Jobs, dogs, and Reeses cups."
2636,My job.
2637,My dogs. Everything else has kind of gone to hell.
2638,My family being healthy & having some time alone
2639,"A roof over our heads, my husband working from home, and having dinner every night together as a family. With 3 kids and their busy schedules, we usually get to eat dinner together 2-3 times a week tops. Now that everything is shut down, we eat lunch and dinner together everyday."
2640,"Living with my father, music, friends that talk to me, my boyfriend, podcasts and games on the pc I want to try"
2641,"Spending time with my cats, exercising everyday, cooking delicious meals and just focusing on doing things that make me happy."
2642,"My family being well enough and in a country with healthcare that we can treat our very sick dog even during those hard times.
Also my boyfriend being loving and supportive, even though we are quarantined separately with our respective families and missing eachother like crazy"
2643,"My job, without a doubt."
2644,That my country kind of have it under control
2645,"My very, very good relationship with my parents. I can't imagine how bad it would've been otherwise."
2646,"We have food in our kitchen, toilet paper in our house, and that even though it‚Äôs ‚Äústay at home‚Äù mandate, I get to spend it with my husband and daughter."
2647,"My husband, he's a rock of stability when I'm losing it from stress.

My log cabin, in the middle of nowhere, far away from the infected."
2648,My son. I have a job where work from home isn‚Äôt possible so I watch my son all day while my husband works. My son is too young to get what‚Äôs going on so all he knows is that he gets to spend a ton of time with Mama. And he loves it. I guess it‚Äôs especially nice since I‚Äôm pregnant so soon it will be hard to give him my undivided attention.
2649,I had a baby in July and decided to take a year off (I was a department manager at a popular high volume grocery store).
2650,Time spent with family
2651,That my friends care enough to call me and I got money to pay my bills
2652,I can never be mandated to complete inservice about PPE again
2653,No pressure to make plans. I can just stay home where I'm most comfortable and conversation is enough.
2654,I am thankful that I'm alive and well
2655,"1) I'm getting paid my normal salary to work from home

2) Animal Crossing

3) my husband is here and not away on deployment.  He got back at the end of January but my BFF's husband went out on the ship that replaced them, so he won't be home until July with no family leave. :(  She's feeling pretty isolated, working from home with just her two dogs for company."
2656,My dogs.
2657,"\- I paid off my student loan debt last January.

\- I do have emergency savings

\- I still have a job and it is at home. But I had to beg my boss to let me work from home ugh.

\- I have food and supplies thanks to my mom the RN who was able to get me a mask, sanitizer, hospital grade wipes and alcohol pads. I cannot believe hospitals are in desperate need of supplies. I did donate money to a hospital in my area....

\- My family and I are safe and healthy and ugh I am just trying to stay positive because what else can you do really?"
2658,internet :)
2659,"That for now, everyone I know is healthy. There's nothing more important than that."
2660,For once I'm glad I live in an extremely remote area and never leave my property anyway. 80 square miles of nothing seems like a good deal for the moment.
2661,"My friends üíõ I joined this group of friends 6 months ago when I started dating my ex, and even though things have ended between us I'm now closer than ever with the group (him included, we ended amicably!)

We're keeping each other sane throughout this, checking in on FB messenger every day, using a group running app to challenge each other, and playing games like Pysch and Uno over video chat every couple of days.

Just knowing that we're all in this together, and all here for each other is really helping us all üòä"
2662,"That I got the job I wanted, I just have to wait until background checks go through (which could take a while, what with all these quarantines) before I can start."
2663,"I‚Äôm incredibly thankful for my boyfriend right now. I‚Äôm staying with him and he‚Äôs taking such good care of me. My anxiety is in overdrive and he‚Äôs been so patient and accommodating.     
I‚Äôm thankful for many other things, but I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd get through this without him."
2664,"my family, my strong friendships, my relationship - and mine and their good health. my house. my happiness. the fact that I have a fridge full of food. my job, which is very stable. I have a lot to be thankful for"
2665,"Having my cat with me at college. Otherwise I‚Äôd be completely alone, 900 miles away from my family."
2666,"Job, food, advanced tech for communication and shopping."
2667,"My family is ok, my job, my apartment, my friends, my mental strenght."
2668,"High-five to all the other introverts!!!!

I‚Äôm extremely thankful I‚Äôm introverted and married to an introvert."
2669,My optimistic rational calm nature
2670,"I'm happy I'm employed, I have food, a roof over my head, I have friends who have reached out to be because they were concerned about me working during this time and my three kitties who are blissfully unaware of what a shit show 2020 has been so far."
2671,My BF! I cant imagine if he weren't with me
2672,"Gods this is gonna sound so dumb
But the sun shines through my window and directly onto my bed so every morning I wake up to a bed warmed by the sun and it's literally like getting hugged by the nicest softest blanket and I love it so much it makes waking up as easy as breathing."
2673,"That I already had almost everything we needed to shelter in place long before the virus, and that my immediate family didn't get it (so far). I'm still suffering from a lower respirator infection from mid February and I have an autoimmune disease, so I'm pretty sure I would die if I got it. I'm also very thankful that my husband can work from home, and that his employer decided to force everyone to stay home early on. I'm really hoping that they keep the work from home order in effect a while longer because people are just starting to show up at our area hospitals now."
2674,My mom allowing me to live with her rent-free.
2675,"My partner who is also quarantined with me and my pets. I'd be so bored and lonely without them. Also still being employed, being able to work remotely, and getting paid."
2676,Having a roof over my head.
2677,"My job, that my parents are safe in the Irish countryside away from the virus, the fact that I am financially stable, have food, a place to stay and am otherwise fit and well, my friends and the wonderful NHS."
2678,"Very thankful for having a roof over my head and having food in my fridge. My good health and my family and friends are all healthy. I'm also thankful I'm only responsible for myself. Of course, I care for my friends and family, but I don't need to worry about home schooling a child while working from home. I don't have to worry about the fact I won't potentially be working till May and that'll prevent me from feeding a child or someone else dependent on me."
2679,"My family. I have a toddler and a baby, and while being a mom through all this adds a layer of anxiety that wouldn't have been there before, having them here keeps me sane. I'm forced to maintain a schedule, cook meals, keep healthy food in the house, keep our surroundings clean, etc. While it is tiring, I think it's good for my mental health to maintain this normalcy. Also, I really enjoy having my husband home."
2680,"My housemates, the Australian government for providing an income package to those affected, my family who even though I cannot be with, I can still facetime them when I wish"
2681,That I'm living with my loving family and that I haven't spent a single penny this entire time lmao truly blessed and lucky
2682,"My job, friends and family"
2683,"Spending more time outside, and that I have a bit of a backyard I can sit in.   
I can see birds and squirrels from the window I sit next to, and yesterday I saw two goldfinches, spring is coming!"
2684,Ah what a blessing! I can‚Äôt wait to join that club. I just bought this past November so I‚Äôve got a looong way to go.
2685,"Seconding this! It may not be the best or most rewarding job, but having the security of both a paycheck and something to keep me occupied during all of this is invaluable."
2686,Definitely same!
2687,I keep saying there has to be light to come from all this darkness. This is exactly what I like to read. This is the light.
2688,That‚Äôs honestly an excellent point. I hope impacts like this are long lasting. One of my favorite sayings is along those lines. Make time every day for the things that make life worth living. I fear that my life will ultimately be waiting to live in retirement. I try so hard to have something I love in every day to avoid feeling regretful as I age.
2689,I love this! It‚Äôs the little things! I love cooking and so does my boyfriend so it‚Äôs nice to be able to eat quality meals the past few weeks.
2690,Introvert here also. Do you ever feel like you took for granted all the times you could've gone out but chose to stay home? Now that I'm forced to stay home I really miss the times I could've gone out but didn't. I always wished I could've been more extroverted. Im wondering if this will be what does it for me.
2691,"A very thoughtful comment.

We owe those people in essential services and on the frontlines a lot of gratitude. They're truly doing amazing work."
2692,All of the unsung heroes of this time! One of my friends is a RN and she was literally yelled at for grocery shopping. It‚Äôs not like she had just come from work or anything. I can‚Äôt believe people are anything but grateful to all their sacrifice right now. I‚Äôm extremely thankful for all the people keeping necessities operational!
2693,I am LOVING the built in therapy of having my pup around during the work day!
2694,Having savings has been so relieving.
2695,"Wow that‚Äôs such an amazing employee perk to have, especially with COVID-19. What a blessing!"
2696,"Yes! In all the negativity, it gives me the fuzzies seeing so many people stepping up to help others."
2697,Agreed! I wish I could extend my fortunes to everyone who‚Äôs really hurting in this pandemic
2698,That‚Äôs so cute that y‚Äôall social distance visit each other! That‚Äôs some love ‚ù§Ô∏è
2699,Aw that sucks! I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre sick. I hope you get better soon! Congratulations on your baby!
2700,"Definitely being separated from people you love helps appreciate them more! I had my grandma call yesterday to check up on me. We don‚Äôt talk too much because of a language barrier, but it was so nice to hear from her and joke that all we‚Äôre doing is eating, watching TV, and sleeping. We both joked that we can‚Äôt stay out of the kitchen! I can‚Äôt wait to visit family too ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2701,"Yes, yes, and YES!

I‚Äôm glad you and your loved ones are doing well üôÇ"
2702,Saaame! So grateful for my own carved out piece of the universe.
2703,Yes on the student loan payments! Thank you so much for your hard work üôÇ
2704,"That‚Äôs true! I have definitely been actively connecting with people, which I am notoriously terrible at. I am trying to make habits to keep once this is all over, keeping in better contact being one of them."
2705,Yeah that‚Äôs tough. Health care professionals have really been shining these past few months. Their dedication is unrivaled. I hope your friends‚Äô mom stays healthy through her service for your community.
2706,"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you and in the meantime, I‚Äôm glad your pups can gift you love and comfort. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without my babygirl"
2707,I read somewhere that maintaining their normal schedule as much as possible helps a lot with the change. Are your kids happy with the adjustment to eating lunch and dinner with you both? I imagine so üôÇ
2708,I‚Äôve been using this time to rediscover myself. I feel closer to me and love myself and my body better. My exercise bike just came in the mail today; I‚Äôm so excited to continue using it
2709,Me too with no hesitation. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre being cool about telework and being sick too!
2710,"If I have to be quarantined, I love being with my man and my pup. It‚Äôs a cozy way to exist in some walls."
2711,"If you don‚Äôt mind my asking, where is your log cabin? I‚Äôd love to own one, one day..."
2712,"My goal in asking this question was to get people to think about the positives because gratitude really helps your frame of mind. I was also curious if there were things I should be thankful for that I didn‚Äôt think of!

It‚Äôs pretty wild that this is really happening and it‚Äôs so easy to spiral in all the sensational news and terribly things going on. I get where you‚Äôre coming from. I‚Äôm just trying to remind myself of all the good and fortune I have in my life. It‚Äôs also a great opportunity to get to know myself better through activities and hobbies."
2713,I‚Äôm so grateful for this also!
2714,I love this so much!! A friend of mine that I met through an ex like 12 years ago is including me in games with her friends (who I‚Äôve met; they live in Canada and I‚Äôm in the states). It‚Äôs very nice to feel included
2715,Congratulations!!! And understood about the background checks lol
2716,"I feel the same way. This experience has really highlighted to me how fortunate I am and has helped me be more grateful for my am circumstances. No matter how hard you work, you can‚Äôt escape the luck that‚Äôs part of the equation."
2717,I just graduated a few months ago and so did my boyfriend. We were just talking about not even being able to imagine how incredibly stressful it must be to be a college student right now. I really feel for you. You‚Äôre doing the best you can and be patient with yourself. Good luck! I‚Äôm happy to talk if you need some company. College is stressful af
2718,SERIOUSLY. it‚Äôs been such a shitshow. Can I have a refund for 2020?
2719,That is not dumb at all! I kind of wish my window were in a different spot now...
2720,I‚Äôm sure your husband would be able to talk to his boss about your being immunocompromised. Anyone with a brain and soul would let him continue teleworking even if they lift the shelter in place orders. Please stay safe! I wish you health and happiness and comfort üôÇ
2721,Parents can be the best!
2722,It‚Äôs helped me stick to my budget better too üòÇ
2723,Yes! I love being able to sit on my patio during the endless meetings and watching the hummingbirds üòä
2724,"Agreed. NICU nurse here and we've been just as busy so I'm just working tons of OT to hide from the world. There's a little bit of happy amidst all the choas in the world. I love my babies, I love my coworkers, and I love our doctors."
2725,"Definitely, just keep yourself busy"
2726,"Nope. I get out a lot normally, I'm just the last to show up and first to leave kind of person. Now there's no FOMO because nothing is going on, and no expectations to be anywhere."
2727,"I‚Äôve definitely enjoyed shelter in place and telework, but I definitely can‚Äôt help but want to go on an extroverted rampage when we‚Äôre allowed to lol"
2728,Thanks ü•∞
2729,Thank you!
2730,Thank you!
2731,Oh thank you so much. I keep reminding myself that people have it worse with this awful virus. Dogs are such a lifesaver - a good long walk and a nice play session really helped lift my mood. Hope you're staying safe and well.
2732,"NH, close to the White Mountains. It's pretty much heaven up here."
2733,Thank you. :)
2734,Thank you so much. I wish the same for you.
2735,Thanks for the reminder that life goes on - the happy parts as well as the difficult and sad parts! I started making a baby blanket for my downstairs neighbor yesterday because it's so helpful to remember that life is going on and beautiful things are still happening in the midst of this.
2736,"Jacob ((last name redacted)) threw a pen at my face in the 7th grade and while I know it doesn‚Äôt matter now.... I‚Äôd throw a pen back at him now lol. 

It‚Äôs so weird! But it‚Äôs my one hard grudge!"
2737,My dad. his stupid expectations for me and his immaturity are still fucking with me
2738,"In Kindergarten my class did that thing where you fill a shoebox with toys, books, etc and they mail them to children in need. I filled mine with my Mom with colouring books, pencil crayons, a sharpener, little toys, etc. On the day the project was due, everyone in class did a Show and Tell with what they put in their shoebox. A girl in my class presented my shoebox like it was hers (I don't know if she didn't make one, or just didn't care about the presentation) and I was absolutely heartbroken. Don't even remember her name, but I remember how I felt."
2739,The woman who covered my car in coffee grounds. It like solidified in parts and damaged the paint. I never got it repainted so I see the little areas the paint is fucked up every time I drive.
2740,"The girl who stole my wallet when I was in college. She wasn't just any other girl. She was my sister's best friend. She knew I was going on a trip to see my parents for Christmas. She KNEW she took my wallet (she used my debit card less than 10 minutes later). When I went to her house to ask her about it, I heard her tell her dad to tell me she wasn't home. I told my sister about it and she talked to her friend who played dumb. My sister believed me and stopped talking to her friend. Then later her friend reached out (maybe like 6 - 9 months later) and she spun this story about what happened. My sister talked to me about it and I repeated what I had said happened which didn't line up with friend. Sister stopped talking to friend. Rinse and repeat every 6 - 12 months on average for about 6 years. Every time my sister would let her friend tell her what happened, something would be different/contradicting the first story. My sister would believe her every time and I would then remind my sister of the contradictions. It was an super annoying never ending cycle. Then I went to visit my sister. She and her friend were back on speaking terms again and my entire visit with my sister was my sister trying to convince me to meet up with friend sonshe could ""clear the air"" and we'd have no more ""miscommunication"". I told my sister to drop it or I would stay with friends the rest of the visit. Her friend called me all sorts of names to my sister once it was evident I wouldn't be making an appearance. Sister told friend they weren't to be talking about it again. 


The following year we had a family reunion in sister's city (my hometown area) and a second sister had a new dog. It was S1's friends dog. When I asked about it, I was told ""we don't talk about friend in this house"". So, S1's friend apparently burned a bridge with 2 of us and S1 FINALLY came to terms that her ""friend"" isn't a good person. 


It's not so much that she stole my wallet, which was crappy enough, but it's that she kept using my sister's good nature against her. You don't come back from messing with my family. Not in my book."
2741,"My dad. There was a pretty rough time in our family‚Äôs life. He was kind of ‚Äúin love‚Äù with his assistant so he would be extremely rude with my mom. One day my mom asked him if he could fire her cause she wasn‚Äôt feeling confortable with the situation anymore, my dad argued with my mom at first but then my mom threatened to leave him so he fired his assistant. A couple of months passed and my dad was super depressed so one day he was drinking and talking to his ex-assistant in secret but my mom caught him and asked for an explanation, he became so aggressive, he hit my mom called me a fucking bitch (we speak spanish so the cuss words were worse) and when my brother stepped up for my mom he and my dad started to fight. The next day he acted like nothing had happened and since then he hasn‚Äôt apologized properly. I‚Äôve talked to my mom about this and she says it‚Äôs time to let got, he‚Äôs my father and i should forgive him, but i can‚Äôt make myself do it."
2742,Literally everyone that voted for Trump
2743,"Honestly, my best friend. In high school I always called my boyfriends ‚Äòbear‚Äô as a nickname, like Ricky-bear or Jamesy-bear, that was just something I loved to do and it was my thing. Then when she finally met the guy she was going to be with she started jokingly calling him ‚Äòbear‚Äô and kept with it. They eventually got married and had kids and that‚Äôs now their family nickmame, a la ‚Äòthe robinson bears‚Äô. Even though I‚Äôve been single for awhile now it drives me fucking mad that she basically stole my thing and it infuriates me everytime she posts about it and uses that name."
2744,"A lot of fake friends who smeared my husband's name because he hurt their egos. They destroyed years worth of friendships by fabricating ""evidence"" of something really minor he didn't do (sharing a screenshot from Facebook. Seriously. That was it.) and spreading rumors of shit he didn't say. In the end we both walked away from the entire group and a hobby we had loved for over a decade. It was worth it to no longer be immersed in so much toxicity and negativity anymore."
2745,"Myself. I have to realize that the bullying I‚Äôve gone through is long gone, and it‚Äôs time to enjoy life again. I‚Äôll just give it time, and work and improve."
2746,"My mom, for choosing drugs and my abusive dad over me"
2747,"A former friend of mine. I have no idea how one person can be so problematic. She lied about her PTSD triggers as an excuse to be lazy and the center of attention. She lied about details of her rape (that's how I know some of her triggers are fake). She has full-blown mental breakdowns when she doesn't get what she wants. She gaslights people to turn them against each other. She holds ""interventions"" for people as an excuse to bash them to their face while looking like the good guy. She brags about having a job at a prestigious theatre company when she's just an usher. I kicked her out of my life and she has the nerve to tell people she's the victim."
2748,"My uncle. And he is...just the worst. Let me explain.

Firstly he caused his wife, who I loved dearly, to kill herself with his cheating and emotional abuse. She was struggling with mental illness and instead of getting her help he continued to cheat then would call her crazy when she'd get upset. She did it with a gunshot to the head and it wasn't clean because it was spur of the moment and she had no clue what she was doing. (That's important I swear)

He, the idiot that he was, had an open casket funeral and everyone was traumatized. They'd heard of what she'd done but it looked so much worse in reality.

 His kids are growing to be little entitled demon spawn and I believe its his fault. They weren't taught to clean after themselves, take responsibility for mistakes, be kind, share, keep hands to themselves etc. I know what you're thinking: ""towersandflowers that's just how kids are"" I'd say that too. I have 5 other younger siblings so I should know. But no. They take all those traits and crank em to 11 cause for some reason they were taught any of those basic qualities are 'sissy qualities', so unfortunately they don't get scolded for doing shitty things. In fact they are defended for them. 

He uprooted his childrens lives to get away from his new wife because ""he has to do chores if he won't get a job"". He doesn't wanna do that so He went from Texas to Florida then back again complaining to anyone with functioning eardrums over the winter break and wouldn't enroll them in school. He crashed with us last minute cause my dad's a softie. (Love em though) My siblings became more and more uncomfortable as they realized their cousins were rather mean and they'd have to share a space for who knew how long. 

I try not to fault the kids too much cause it's their dad's job to raise them better and their mom passed in such a horrible way, but they do make it hard in times like those.

My uncle then has the balls to tell me how to raise kids. Mind you, I don't fancy myself a maternal type right now so kids are not on my mind. He insists that he knows best since he has kids (who run wild 98.9% of the time but alright) He insists that since I know how to cook that I learned it to one day have a big family...which I actively facepalm to cause it hasn't clicked that I cook cause I live mostly to myself and I don't wanna starve. He just has fuckin old fashioned and tired ideals and standards that he can't even live up to and he just irratates the hell outta me.

On top of what he's done if coupled with his personality, I'd say that yeah he isn't my favorite person and this grudge is definitely fresh."
2749,"My H was in a ""friend's"" wedding and I wasn't included on the invitation. He had to reach out to this guy to find out if I was invited. We were married at the time and had entertained this guy and the bride in our home so they knew me. I guess I was, but when we got to the wedding I didn't have a place card and the table my H was assigned to was filled. I was so mortified and felt like I was wedding-crashing. We'd spent $$$ out of our joint budget for H to be in this wedding and I was just so embarrassed. I'm sure it was just an oversight, but I think about it and get all anxious every time we see them. Thankfully, we only see them occasionally through mutual friends. I say ""friend"" because this guy has reached out to H once since the wedding - when he needed something. 

To be clear, I would never reach out to ask someone if I was invited to something but in this case we were married and H was in the wedding, why wouldn't I have been invited?"
2750,"My best friend from high school.
 We used to be really close and one day she had to go out with her boyfriend, her parents were really strict so dating was not allowed. That day I get a call from her mother asking ng whether she was with me that day, I lied and said that she was so she doesn't get grounded. Her mother went ballistic and started shouting at me for being a bad influence and started bad mouthing my mother. I got mad and cut the call, my 'friend' didn't say anything to defend me and neither has she apologized."
2751,"Some of the major ones: 

* Old retail manager: she was horrible, always yelling and such an incredibly disgusting human.  She once said whilst I was crying after my now deceased had a stroke and NEARLY died, ""It's old, what do you expect?"" - I should have said the same to her about her grandparents.  I know that she's going to die soon, doesn't make it any easier. 
* My partner's close friend: he's toxic through and through, I don't spend time with him and I refuse.  We got into a passionate discussion, he kept arguing, I refused.  There are no redeemable qualities about him and everyone says the same thing.  I tried. 
* My partner's close friend's girlfriend: stop trying to talk to my boyfriend, he has never liked you and neither have I.  Take a hint.  You're supposed to be an adult. 
* Old colleague: she accused me of some pretty horrible things including theft from her home (I lived in her apartment for two or so months) and then she threw out a box of my belongings. 

I have people in my life that I have hated and these people I have had immense anger for.  It has eased off and I barely feel anything, but I answered with people that if I were in a room with who would I want to punch in the face and they're it.  They don't affect me nowadays and I refuse to let anyone live rent-free in my mind."
2752,"my previous ""friends"". I wish they just outright bullied me like those idiots when I was younger. Instead they decided to fake being my friend because ""they felt sorry for me"" spread rumors so no one wanted to even be close to me and made everyone throw shade at me because I'll be repeating a year in Uni which honestly is the best thing to happen because I got to be with better friends.

I don't hate people. Except for these two, sometimes I just want to see them suffer and then die."
2753,Spotify commercials. They annoyed me during a road trip so badly I swore to never give them any money and still haven‚Äôt to this day.
2754,Rochelle from 7th grade who bullied me into letting her copy my homework and then got caught getting us both in trouble. I hope she ccx suffers a lifetime of ingrown hairs.
2755,"My sisters ex, he was very mentally abusive towards her, she would sit in her room and cry every night because of him. Thankfully she was able to leave him and find someone better."
2756,"my crush, he‚Äôs actually a really good friend but hes been ignoring me so we‚Äôve been going distant so its like a love hate relationship"
2757,"The pidgin trying to take over my balcony once again.

The guy who lived here before me was hardly ever home, so it had free reign of the balcony - a sheltered safe place. 

But when I moved in, it simply wouldn‚Äôt accept the new state of things.    
It sat on and pecked at my newly planted flowers. Crapped on my table. Sowed a thistle and a nettle in my flower pots with its pidgin feet. Looked in at me with a creepy unblinking stare.

And this year, it‚Äôs been there at least once already...

But I‚Äôll laugh last, pidgin. Corona is on, and I‚Äôm home all the time. I‚Äôll see you! I‚Äôll stare at you creepily. You won‚Äôt live on my balcony ever again!!!"

2759,"This was back in my senior year on High School, class 2018! 
I still hold a grudge towards my old HS crush because one, he kept calling everything I liked stupid (I explained it in a reply somewhere in the comments). Two, he tried to change my religion. He brought up Santa Claus and then used Rick's words from Rick and Morty as evidence.. Like, boy? How the FRICK did I end up licking someone like you? I honestly don't even remember anymore."
2760,"The ex partner of my best friend back than. Its 10 years ago and I am still bitter about it.

He treated her like shit in that on and off thing they had going on, he strung her along and drove her to develop a drinking problem. I tried to get her out of it (which happend eventually) and he said some of the meanest things to me, someone ever did. Something along the line of me having a dark soul, deserving endless suffering and no support whatsoever.

No Marvin, you cant try to reconnect a few years later, telling everyone you were a mess due to a mental illness and not even apoligizing or aknowledging what you did to people.
I am dealing with mental problems as well, but those do not mean you get a free pass on anything you do. Its pathetic and I cant believe no one besides me sees that and feeds into your bullshit once again."
2761,"Guy in uni in my res who didn't know how to do his own dishes I meant him my cleaning things and we started talking about things we liked, start of the year, trying to make friends.  Well we get on the topic of anime, and I'm taking about having an emotional attachment to one that isn't incredible but that is special to me because my dad is really busy with work but would always make time to spend with me and watch it since I was 3.  My friend joins us in the lounge and we start taking about Star Wars vs Star Trek.  I've seen some movies of both and some episodes of Star Trek but not enough to compare so I'm just listening.  Well this guy asks me which is better and I tell him that idk I haven't seen enough of either to compare.  They're both good.  He says that's not good enough and starts railing on the door I told him was special to me.  I went to my room to calm down because I was livid.  My friend texted and apologized for being there and not saying anything.  I came back and asked the guy for an apology.  He did the 5y/o ""sorry not sorry"" thing.  I told him I wanted a real apology and he and if I was fine being an emotional woman.  Told me I was overreacting even after I explained that it wasn't very nice to use something from someone opening up to you against them.  This went on until I just left with my things.  Never got a proper apology, never shared my crap with him again, did not become friends."
2762,"My sister, because she choose to don't come and visit our dad when he was asking to see her. Instead she decided to continue with her life."
2763,"A girl (S) from middle school/HS. We were friends in middle school after another girl was being mean to me. S decided to ""defend me"" by being a bully to her. The whole time I thought she was being a good friend. Then in HS, I stopped talking to a few friends when I found out they were talking shit behind my back, and I kept mostly to myself during school hours. Everyday, I would hear S shouting slurs at me from the back of the bus on the way home. 

She's been cordial to me in public when we bump into each other but I never really got over her being a mean girl."
2764,Chris Evans the radio presenter.
2765,[removed]
2766,"There was this kid in my history class in high school who loved Andrew Jackson. Yeah, the president responsible for the Indian Removal Act and the Trail of Tears. This kid always talked about how Andrew Jackson was his favorite president and on multiple occasions DEFENDED him for the Indian Removal Act and its aftermath. The real kicker here? His dad was a history teacher at our school. Part of his job was to teach students all about Jackson's presidency and the events that transpired during it, yet his son was walking around telling everyone how amazing Jackson was. I can't imagine what his dad would have thought if he found out."
2767,My friend who canceled hanging out with me 3 times maybe 4 but I can‚Äôt remember. They will hangout with their other friends but not me. They also deleted or archived IG photos of us so I did the same.
2768,"This one kid, started randomly annoying me, even though I didn‚Äôt know him at all at the time. I hated him, and I still do. He always acted like he was always right, and no one else was. I still don‚Äôt get it tho..."
2769,"Some girl in my school who is a complete ahole and who does some questionable things at a young age. She lost her virginity at 13, screamed in the commons area for someone ""exposing"" her for doing aromatherapy, and sending all the guys a video of her fingering her pussy with a hot cheeto. Absolutely disgusting. Every lunch period she talks about three new guys and one time she slept with her best friends cousin... In public. I find her behavior absolutely putrid."
2770,Hahahahaha I love this
2771,I feel this.
2772,Omg lmfao what a mean girl!! I had this girl in my kindergarten class who stole my brand new  lisa frank pencils and convinced the teacher it was hers. I‚Äôll never forget her name and I‚Äôll never forgive her.
2773,That is the most random thing I‚Äôve ever heard of someone doing omg why‚Äôd she do it??
2774,What the hell is wrong with her! I would still be mad too
2775,Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt forgive him either. That‚Äôs pretty shitty. I‚Äôm sorry that happened :/
2776,I feel this.
2777,I‚Äôd be pissed too! Did you ever bring it up to her?
2778,Oof I feel that. Good on you for walking away! Hope you guys are happier now
2779,Damn dude I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôd never let that one go either
2780,Omg I had a couple of friends similar to this. I‚Äôll never understand how someone can be so shitty and so self absorbed
2781,Holy shit I don‚Äôt like him either. So sorry about your aunt üòû is he still staying with you guys?
2782,Whattttt that is so weird I wouldn‚Äôt even know how to react in that one. I‚Äôd hold that grudge too
2783,Ugh yes I have plenty of stories like this. People like that suck
2784,"In some way I can relate, but I tend to ignore conversation with him instead due to him calling my interests lame. I name some games, he says they are lame. I name an anime, he says they are lame and stupid. Then tries to give me a list of animes I should watch, I told him they aren't my interest, he calls me lame. I draw a species for an OC, he calls it cringy or stupid (the one I remember was a cyclops and it was a requests for someone)."
2785,Hahahaha May the odds be ever in your favor

2788,A...hot...Cheeto....wow. There is a lot wrong with this girl
2789,Kids are truly capable of being little devils.
2790,"She thought her husband was cheating on her with me. Which makes no sense because 1. I'm a lesbian, and 2. I barely knew her husband.

I have no idea what was going on in their relationship, but it had nothing to do with me.

Of course, I have no way to prove that she was the one that did it to get money for repainting my car, but I know she did it and why."
2791,"I did right when she started dating her now husband and she was like ‚Äòoh come on, it‚Äôs not that big of a deal‚Äô and has always brushed it off."
2792,We are! It was an amazing relief to be away from all of that schoolyard bullshit.
2793,"No, thank goodness. My ma kicked him out after I talked to her about his behavior. They're back home and the kids are finally enrolled."
2794,oh man  no offense but he sounds like a jerk
2795,To be petty I would get them something with their family name but leave about near.
2796,I completely understand this. Boyfriend and I are currently cutting out toxic people. It‚Äôs been a lonely adventure but so worth it.
2797,"Dude, I think over what he has said before and honestly, I'm so glad I immediately lost feelings for him. There were ALOT of things that should've made me look away, but crushes blinded me really."
2798,[removed]
2799,"ugh tell me about it, one time i let this guy get away with saying the n word one time ( ik ik i was young and stupid)"
2800,He also called my fear childish since I've never been in a relationship before. I told him that I'd rather hear it from someone who has lasted in a long healthy relationship than from someone who has dated multiple times for less than a couple months. He moves on too quick. He said I shouldn't have gone that low and I said it was already at rock bottom when you insulted my fear that way.

2802,"Hey, love blinds the human being, but we learn through time. Don't worry!"
2803,"Wild ride, very entertaining, incredibly sad for all the animals involved, made me suspicious of anybody and everybody with a privately run zoo/sanctuary/rescue for wild animals."
2804,Ultimately I feel so so bad for that guy who watched Travis shoot himself. I feel like that was glossed over
2805,"That was the trailer trashiest thing I have ever witnessed.  Just when I thought quarantine had stolen my sanity, Joe Exotic swooped in to assure me that I ain't got nothing on him.

But seriously, I felt bad for all the animals involved.   That shit should be illegal on all levels."
2806,"Shockingly biased against Carole, and totally unsympathetic to the young men and women being manipulated by Joe and Doc and Jeff.  They spent way more time on ""did Carole kill her husband"" and not nearly enough time on ""look at this sex cult Doc is running"" or ""Joe has groomed and abused several young men, got them hooked on meth and tiger cubs, until one of them took his own life.""  I especially wanted to know a LOT more about Lauren, Jeff's wife, but we didn't see any interviews without her gross-ass husband sitting next to her.

(also, I've been to Carole's Big Cat Rescue and all of the animals there looked extremely well cared for, you didn't get to pet or interact with any of them, there were no cubs, etc.  All of that was accurate.  I hope the Big Cat Safety Act finally gets passed with all of this attention.)"
2807,I think everyone is just giving Doc Antle and Joe Exotic a pass for manipulating young men and women into sex. Jeff too. Disgusting old creeps.
2808,"It was bizarre, but in the end, I just felt really bad for those animals. üòû"
2809,Makes me want to pass that big cat safety act. Seriously after zanesville it seems like a no brainer.
2810,I was impressed with the ability of all these oddballs to find and interact with each other. Loved Joe's employees though.
2811,"I don‚Äôt think Carole was that bad or unreasonable (if she actually didn‚Äôt kill her husband). She didn‚Äôt agree with breeding cats and wanted to stop it. She may be charging for the zoo, but those cats are expensive. She may not have always been against breeding, but she was as she got older. If it‚Äôs about going after his family, she may not have had a choice given where Joe‚Äôs money was coming from and she‚Äôs probably pissed this man is threatening her constantly. Why would she hold back if a guy is obsessed with her? 

I feel bad for Saff (spelling?) being misgendered and I read that Joe, Joe Exotic‚Äôs first husband, was upset they showed no footage with his new teeth. 

Overall, I sort of feel bad for a lot of the people who weren‚Äôt Joe/Jeff/Doc/etc. Carole‚Äôs gonna get even more harassment. Netflix revealed a ton of horrible things about these workers and while they didn‚Äôt look bad, it made them look.. not great. It made them look like meth addicted hicks. I felt bad for them. Also, Joe‚Äôs awful and going to get even more attention.

I think Joe and the other people involved are far more scummy than Carole at least.

I did enjoy it, but I realize there‚Äôs probably so much more going on there. I‚Äôm going to have to listen to the podcast. Also, holy shit, some people should not be able to have guns."
2812,"I got 1 episode in and I didn‚Äôt like it. Yeah, it‚Äôs funny. Whatever. But watching these asswipes justify breeding tiger cubs for ‚Äòenrichment‚Äô really made me sick. I couldn‚Äôt watch it past that."
2813,"They're all a bunch of narcissistic, abusive, trashy assholes."
2814,The podcast was better.
2815,"I remembered the story from the podcast, but seeing it in color was that much more surreal. I thought it was very well done and highly entertaining. 

Such a bizarre, wacky, only-in-America type story..."
2816,Absolute roller coaster of a doco that‚Äôs for sure.
2817,I watched one episode since I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Not going to continue. I'm not into trashy documentaries and I definitely can't stand people trying to defend and deny their animal abuse.
2818,"Made a good point in the end but it could have done more to mitigate the effect of putting on camera men who make their living on being charismatic. Thoughtlessly backing their shit talking about Carol with footage of her that is slowed down to look ominous and backed with threatening music is pretty biased filmmaking. It‚Äôs a pretty stark difference to see that when someone else in the doc is accused of something, they don‚Äôt receive the same treatment. Usually it cuts to them defending themselves, exuding charisma. It seems like the difference could have come from Carol being less chatty, but it was still really noticeable that the misogyny of the main characters was being actively supported by the filmmaking."
2819,"I didn't watch it and doubt I will.  Based on everything I've seen about the situation, the show paints Carole in a very misleading light (you can see her thoughts [here](https://bigcatrescue.org/refuting-netflix-tiger-king/?fbclid=IwAR0MGyUCkMAarFNWTlES6kPgGf91p9QTlSmLjREeR6tlLNFDubb6LE_liaw) if you're curious) and glorifies a lot of people who are legitimately bad in a lot of ways.

A social media friend of mine posted the below and I  honestly can't agree more:

> Finally caved and watched the trailer for the Joe Exotic documentary. There‚Äôs a lot to unpack here and, if interested, hear me out:

> I really do not want to watch this. I get it. I really do. It looks fun as fuckin hell. It‚Äôs got tigers and sex and redneck game of thrones type shit. I understand the appeal. And in all honesty I will probably end up watching it soon. But I have a few bones to pick out the gate

> Hoping to be proven wrong but this trailer makes it seem like Joe is the hero of the story. I can say that through extensive research it is my opinion that Joe Exotic is a dumpster fire of a person. He routinely starved and beat endangered animals and then tried to hire an assassin to murder a person. A person I see many people now affectionately refer to as ‚Äúthat fuckin bitch Carole‚Äù Let‚Äôs all just try to remember that shit first and foremost before someone gets Covid-19 from a Joe Exotic 4 President bobble head they have overnight shipped after watching two episodes.

> As a true crime dork, I feel like I‚Äôm seeing people do what they falsely accuse true crime dorks of doing, which is try to make a saint out of the accused. Most true crime nerds are obsessed with watching demented people go down and not being lifted up in the court of public opinion.

> If you‚Äôve seen it and I‚Äôm getting the wrong read off the trailer lmk"
2820,"I left it thinking ‚Äúwow Joe Exotic is a fucking terrible person, thank god he‚Äôs in prison. Carole is shady but someone could make an entire PhD thesis around the misogyny the people in this doc had‚Äù and then when I went to see how people reacted on the internet it was like a slap in the face to see how much Joe‚Äôs being made into this fun pop culture character and everyone‚Äôs losing their minds at ‚Äúthat fucking bitch Carole!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know why I expected more from a world where Trump got elected president but dear god people haaaaaaaate women. Like holy shit"
2821,"It was an over engineered monstrosity and while it was certainly heavily armed and armoured the fact it would frequently break down before even engaging the enemy was a huge mark against it. Compared to something like the Soviet IS-2 which managed to carry the necessary firepower without compromising reliability, you can see why Germany should have stuck with the tried and tested earlier models of tanks instead of wasting so many resources on the Tiger II AKA K√∂nigstiger AKA ""King Tiger""."
2822,We used to drive by the billboard at least 3x a year and always talked about checking it out. I wish we would have stopped. Probably good that we didn't though because we totally would have eaten expired Walmart meat pizza.
2823,Carole definitely killed her husband.
2824,"The fact that this show is so popular shows you why Trump got elected.  I'd bet good money that everyone on the show was a Trump voter. 

Even the minor players did things that were against their best interests, like the lady who got her arm bitten off, and all those volunteers at Big Cat Rescue who worked for years for free.  These are the same type of dumbos who vote against their own interests because they are irrational fools. 

America seems to have a love-hate relationship with these trashy people."
2825,I really hope people learn something from it. I hope no one ever pays for a picture with a Tiger cub again now that they know the cub will just be euthanized in a few weeks when it‚Äôs too big to be profitable.
2826,"Carol's ""rescue"" is not any better than anyone else's on the show, she definitely killed her husband, the whole show is a mess, and I'm gonna watch it for the third time now."
2827,Killing people via exotic animals is going to become popular I foresee in the near future.
2828,It was very interesting and super informative. It's crazy how you don't even realize things like that are happening in the world
2829,Never heard of it. What is it?
2830,"Fucking roller coaster from start to finish that i could not for the life of me stop watching.

Was super interesting and covered a number of topics in one documentary. 

wild"
2831,I haven't watched it and don't really want to spend the time watching it even though I'm very curious about it and just want someone to tell me all the details.
2832,I couldn't watch more than an episode. I felt absolutely awful for the poor animals.
2833,Incredibly entertaining to watch and pretty unforgettable.
2834,"Carole‚Äôs batshit, especially with those flower crowns on."
2835,"It was the weirdest show, like I guess you gotta be a weirdo to be brave enough to take care of these wild animals. 

It was so sad at the end knowing there are more tigers in captivity than there are in the wild."
2836,Idk anything about it except that they continually misgendered a trans man for no reason. Heard everyone sucks though.
2837,I bailed after 20 minutes. It appears to be the ultimate trailer trash being trashy show.
2838,"It was like the horrible abusive people parade, except for a couple of them. The narcissism was laughable at times, but pretty scary to watch in detail. Along with how manipulative most of them were. It made me think about how Trump was able to get elected. I felt horrible for the animals and wish there had been more focus on exposing that. These Tiger douche bags treated the people around them like caged animals, just all props to feed their giant egos."
2839,"I live(d) nearby a big cat sanctuary and the guy who owns it really gives me some good vibes. His big thing is taking in the cats that assholes who can‚Äôt handle them past kittens. So all his cats are grown, his whole thing is against private breeding and circuses and stuff...

It‚Äôs a cool visit! I wish we weren‚Äôt quarantined cuz since this dumbass documentary I‚Äôve wanted to visit! Exotic Feline Rescue Center in Indiana,  in case anyone cares!"
2840,I don‚Äôt know how that guy didn‚Äôt up & quit right then & there. Traumatizing & so sad.
2841,That guy was honestly the hero of that entire story.
2842,"I'm so glad this was mentioned on this post. It seemed everyone just looked over it, and kinda forgot to ever mention it again. How absolutely horrific"
2843,And none of his girls were interviewed. Just the one who escaped who was EYE OPENING
2844,It's a strange world! Then Joe brings in the outsider (campaign manager) and he is just like WTF is going on. Same reaction as everyone watching lol
2845,"Carole has been WAY overcriticized in response to this.  The show completely misrepresented her ex-husband's missing case.  And besides the (slim imo) possibility of her having killed him, I really don't think she did anything bad.  Her rescue [actually does](https://bigcatrescue.org/cages/) have better conditions than Joe's and she had a legitimate case against him.  Also he literally shot a blow-up doll dressed as her so of course she was gonna sue him hard.  

I don't understand why people are focusing on her when all the other people are *proven* to be awful"
2846,"He was doing all these trips to Costa Rica in private planes I hate to speculate but he may have been smuggling either drugs or animals. He was a womanizer and tried to completely cut out his kids from the previous marriage. Didnt have a valid pilots license. Told his friend ‚Äúif he could pull it off it would be the slickest thing in his life‚Äù. He‚Äôs either in the gulf or in Costa Rica with another woman and all the money and gold he buried. 

Nobody is even mentioning that the executive secretary and the ex wife have the same last name?!??"
2847,"The show gets better and better imo, and it is worth watching even if you didn‚Äôt care for the first episode."
2848,Agreed.  I feel like the series was more concerned with being sensational than being accurate.  They left out a ton of details regarding Don's disappearance and very clearly wanted the viewers to think Carole was responsible
2849,What podcast? What did you like better in podcast over the netflix series?
2850,Perfect for quarantine
2851,"There really are no heroes, Joe certainly wasn't painted as one to my eye. The major players are all pretty bad people; the few who aren't (for example Joe's campaign manager) are almost there by accident.

Having seen the barest edge of folks who live in a world like that myself, I think it a reasonable portrayal of that sort of society. I do feel a little sullied for having watched it. It felt mostly like a car-crash that you want to look away from but can't.

""What meth would look like if it smoked meth"" - John Oliver about ""Tiger King"""
2852,This is why you watch actually watch the show and not base your opinion on the trailer. Joe comes out of this looking like the worst person in the whole show.
2853,I've been there!
2854,"I liked that place! Glad to hear it holds up, my brother and I just watched tiger king and discussed our visit here."
2855,And the worker who‚Äôs arm was bitten off.. like holy hell!!
2856,"What did the show misrepresent about Carole's case? They had some pretty solid evidence from what I saw. The husband filed a restraining order saying she threatened to kill him, and after he disappeared the will was modified in a way that benefited Carole."
2857,What's the actual story with Carole's husband then? I was so convinced she had something to do with it based on the series.
2858,"Also... given all the details they told us about what a disgusting person Don was, they totally gave him a pass. Holy shit, he had an affair with a woman younger than his own children that he coerced into his car when he found her crying walking the streets while running from her abusive husband, left his wife (whom he married when she was fourteen) and family for her, then tried to make sure she got nothing when he wanted to divorce her to find another adolescent bride."
2859,"Joe Exotic by Wondery.

I liked basically everything about the podcast better with the exception of the visuals. It was nice to see the faces that went with the stories. Podcast also had way more detail and information. Netflix didnt even talk about how Joe faked his music ""career."" And they made Carole seem crazy for what seemed like nothing more than sensationalism."
2860,"Saff! And they went back to work IN FIVE DAYS. And the arm might have been save-able? With PTO and more surgeries? I mean, yeah you have autonomy but...it seemed like the decision was made so casually. Am I remembering that right?

W T F

JUST NO. So many things in that show were just no."
2861,"Pretty much all the information given about the case was from his ex-family who obviously hates her.  I read her response to the documentary and he was a lot more shady than the show let on.  Apparently no one knew how much money he actually had or how he made it, and he was frequently going to Costa Rica before disappearing."
2862,"Keep in mind that this is directly from her, but... [link](https://bigcatrescue.org/refuting-netflix-tiger-king/?fbclid=IwAR0MGyUCkMAarFNWTlES6kPgGf91p9QTlSmLjREeR6tlLNFDubb6LE_liaw)"
2863,"Keep in mind that this is directly from her, but... [link](https://bigcatrescue.org/refuting-netflix-tiger-king/?fbclid=IwAR0MGyUCkMAarFNWTlES6kPgGf91p9QTlSmLjREeR6tlLNFDubb6LE_liaw)"
2864,This is why I personally think he wasn't murdered and left to Costa Rica.  People shouldn't disregard that theory given the type of person he is
2865,"To be fair, if you pay attention, you can tell Joe is not singing himself. And it's not even in the top 15 of the weirdest things about the story, so I don't blame them for not focusing on it. 

The doc did paint Carole as about as crazy as all the other bonkers characters in the whole affair. I can see how it was a little bit unfair on her since I felt like she had the best intentions. With that said, even if they exaggerated things, her organization's volunteer structure doesn't seem much more fair than the personality cult's of the other big cat keepers and her current husband's talk of ""war"" also seemed like they had lost sight of what this was all about."
2866,Thanks! I didn't know it was a podcast
2867,"Oh man, I‚Äôll have to check it out. I wondered about the Carole thing and would love to know more."
2868,"I really feel like Saff was coerced into that decision. Exotic was very charismatic and was clearly worried about the financial implications. Saff saying, If I stay in the hospital the media wins.... *Shudder*. Sounded like Joe talking. 

Not to mention they mentioned Saff signing something with the damaged hand. What were they signing?"
2869,
2870,"I don't see much there that refutes what the documentary said. She confirmed that there was a restraining order against her, and that the will was changed to include disappearance, which are the two main pieces of evidence the documentary puts forward. Most of the other arguments she puts forward are just ad hominem, or are claims she is making with no evidence. She also left out the fact that her boyfriend also filed a restraining order against her in 2002, which makes her claim that Don's restraining order was just to stop her from taking his stuff less credible. The meat grinder point seems reasonable though."
2871,"Yeah, or even if he was murdered, a guy that amoral tends to make a lot of enemies. It's not like Carole was the first or last person he screwed over.

The saddest part was how his first wife defended him after how he dirty he did her."
2872,Joe was also very manipulative. I‚Äôm sure he used the cats against her in that decision as in ‚Äúthey‚Äôll shut me down if this looks too bad and they‚Äôll put down the animals you love plus I don‚Äôt have the money for there complex surgeries.‚Äù It‚Äôs like classic sea world mauled employee procedure. I would assume she signed a liability release to not sue cause it sure as shit wasn‚Äôt a settlement from the context clues she was interviewed around piles of trash.
2873,"He was a guy who frequently went to Costa Rica....deliberately flying under radar with a revoked pilot's license.  I immediately thought drug running, which is a p good excuse for disappearing forever in the middle of the night."
2874,"My thoughts exactly. Also, just read a thing saying Saff is a trans man and was consistently misgendered by Joe and the documentary. Wish that had been more clear, that's terrible. He has since left the park, so I hope his life has improved."

2893,Forgot what a good song Funk my life up was. Nutini just seemed to disappear.
2894,You'd rather live in shit than pick up a shovel and I'm sick of hearing about it since you won't do anything about it.
2895,"The only reason you avoid technology is because you don't like admitting that you don't know what you're doing and don't like people teaching you things. It's not because you're too intelligent for it. That's not a thing.

No one is looking at you and thinking you're so skilled because you do things ""the old way"", they think you're ridiculous because you quit your job because you had to complete online training modules and you refused to do them because use you wouldn't all for help with the computer."
2896,You need to shower and brush your teeth more. I sleep facing away from you because your breath smells.
2897,"It's not all about you all the time. We all have shit going on, so maybe try asking how I am every once in a while...."
2898,we need to break up.
2899,You have a litmus test for everything and it's annoying. You spend all of your time sitting on the couch but somehow feel comfortable judging other people for doing (or not doing) things like you think they should? Get off of your high fucking horse.
2900,"You need to stop judging other people and putting them down.  Who cares if .... is a terrible dresser?  Or if.....has gained some weight? Why do YOU HAVE to talk about others this way, what are you getting out if it? Isn't it more important to be kind, and to appreciate other people's good qualities instead of gossiping or picking at them over such unimportant details?"
2901,pull your head out of your ass and accept you can be wrong sometimes. you‚Äôre such a hypocrite
2902,"I‚Äôve been thinking about this for a long time. There‚Äôs a lot more I could say, a lot I‚Äôve considered, but these are the basics. I think there‚Äôs a strong possibility we‚Äôve outgrown each other. It‚Äôll hurt and it fucking sucks, and God knows how close we were. But we‚Äôre not close anymore. We don‚Äôt talk anymore, and we have nothing in common. You can deny it, but it‚Äôs been this way for months. Now I‚Äôve grown as a person, and the MusicalFrost you know in your head isn‚Äôt me. You don‚Äôt know me anymore. And I think it would be the best for both of us if we move on. Find new friends. Grow into ourselves so we can progress even further and not rely on each other anymore. I love you and will always love you, and of course you can still come to me if you need help, but if I‚Äôm being brutally and painfully honest, I think being attached to you is holding me back. I‚Äôm willing to talk if you need to, but saying this is my closure: I‚Äôm moving on. I‚Äôll miss you. I‚Äôll always cherish the good times in our friendship, and I want to thank you. You were the one to help me get this far, and I‚Äôll always be indebted to you for that. But now, I have places to go, and you‚Äôre in my past. 

I don‚Äôt have the guts to say it to you directly right now. I‚Äôm still coming to terms with this decision myself. But someday I hope I will, and I hope it doesn‚Äôt cause you too much pain."

2907,"Your actions have consequences and I will not let you get away with committing welfare fraud because your girlfriend wants you to. You need to take a biiiig step back and really look at who you've become in recent years, because lately I don't even know who you are anymore, and I don't think you'd like what you saw if you actually did look at yourself. You've turned into a selfish, manipulative fuckstain. You are 25 and you've never worked a day in your life, you exploit your mother and grandmothers generosity and now you're exploiting your friend mothers generosity too. It's not good enough. You were raised better than this. Grow the fuck up."
2908,"you are an alcoholic idiot who is very quick to criticise everybody else despite being a sorry excuse for a mother, daughter and wife. you are lazy, entitled, vile and disgusting. the alcoholism might‚Äôve gotten to your brain, but it hasn‚Äôt mine; i will never forget the shit you have done to my family."

2919,This is not worse for you than it is for everyone else.
2920,"You pretend everything‚Äôs going to be alright when it‚Äôs not. The only person you care about is yourself, you only care about what is going to keep you happy longer. You lie about wanting to try but as soon as you start to face real issues you give up. It just feels like a ticking bomb now, not a matter of if it will happen."
2921,Get your head out of your bum.
2922,I'm tired of waiting for more.
2923,You are the thing in this family we are all afraid of. Being abused is not an excuse to pass that abuse on.

2925,"Stay home from church. Your deity is not going to to prevent you from catching and spreading COVID-19. You are endangering your friends, family, and everyone you come into contact with because you are selfish and short-sighted. It's not a sign of the strength of your faith.

2927,"‚ÄúGet your shit together and stop blaming everyone else for your garbage attitude.‚Äù

Surprise! It‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm the one who needs to hear it."
2928,You‚Äôre only in this relationship because you are scared to be alone. This man is not good for you‚Äôre not good for him. If you weren‚Äôt financially dependent on him you would‚Äôve already left but you cut out everyone in your life who would‚Äôve been able to help you get away. Now you stay with him because you have no way out but a few years down the road probably when all your children moved out you‚Äôll realize you‚Äôre stuck with a bad Person and either just accept it or you‚Äôll leave him and regret all the years you‚Äôve spent with a somebody who brings you more pain than happiness. You‚Äôve ignored all the abusive behavior he showed but it will cost you in the end.

2931,You deserve better
2932,"Work-Friend: You've been dating less than 3 years. If HALF the stuff you say about the relationship is true, you're sticking around for nothing more than perceived sunk costs. If you spew this type of stuff at a coworker, I imagine that is not even the half of it.

Coworker: You're not the only one swamped, taking initiative, feeling the burden of tons of work. We work in a health firm - we are ALL feeling it. We are ALL going above and beyond. Your 2nd half of your department is a bit of a slacker, and I get that and I'm sorry. But that's not really our deal, we have our own departments/ workloads/ deliverables to worry about"
2933,"Going through a difficult phase doesn't justify you treating other people poorly, above all if they're trying to help you"
2934,I don't believe that you quit being friends with me because I'm toxic. I believe you quit being friends with me because I chose not to live my life how you wanted me to and you couldn't handle having someone in your life you couldn't control.

You aren‚Äôt yourself anymore, you‚Äôre a shell of the person you used to be. You never seem happy. Not a single person in our family likes your boyfriend. You deserve better!"
2945,"As much as I love you, you have an entitled personality that repel people away. And if you continue to mistreat others, then you‚Äôll end up alone. And it won‚Äôt be anyone‚Äôs fault but yourself."
2946,"Karma will bite your ass one day. Maybe not now, tomorrow or this year. But it will. Having been through bad stuff in life is no excuse to be a shithole.  Get help cause im tired of you using people as a punching bag and then play the victim"
2947,I don't love you and I'm not obligated to.
2948,You‚Äôre boyfriend is stressing you out and sucking you dry. You‚Äôre older sister is abusive to you due to the fact that you‚Äôre a 25 year old women and you still don‚Äôt have your shit together. Like....not even remotely.  Your dream job is something you need a hell of a lot of schooling for (I.e math) and you have no interest in it. Your GPA is a wreck and you complain you have no money yet always eat out.
2949,Ever since you started dating your boyfriend everything in your life has gone to shit.
2950,You should stop getting angry at your family for not giving you the attention the way you want. Every one is busy with their own life. You are not a kid..behave like a grown up. You are 5 years older than me.
2951,You need to work on yourself. You can't just keep going to the people you meet and telling them your problems and hoping they'll have the magic answer. Your negative attitude is affecting the people around you. Nothing is going to happen for you if you just sit around and complain.
2952,[removed]
2953,He's just not that into you.
2954,"Don't get married to this girl. Get out of the cult. Go experience the world, travel and live outside of this sink hole for even a few months. There's so much more, and the church doesnt have the answers you need. Live together for a few years before you make that jump... I love you but damn."
2955,"You don't need ""closure"". You need an excuse to open up a channel to hear his repeated, empty promises of change in order to once again, settle for him."
2956,To my Male friend.... you are enabling your 30 year old daughter to the point of emotional incest.
2957,"I regret the day you brought home this stupid dog and no matter how cute he is or how much you cry, I will never change my mind. I hate it, other dogs, and have never ever in my life wanted a dog. You made a decision without consulting me and ignoring how I feel and I'm low-key resentful. Oh and using other people's opinions about the dog to try and sway me to give up and ""just enjoy the dog"" for the next 15 years or until it dies makes me want to die."
2958,"i‚Äôm sorry to tell you but if you‚Äôre not ready to emotionally be vulnerable this is going to be a very rough thing to get over

when you told me to leave it made me feel like i couldn‚Äôt be there for you 

so what are you going to do when we live together and you feel uncomfortable sharing your emotions? are you going to pull the same thing? because if you do you already know i‚Äôm not one to come back."
2959,"everyone isn't judging you, but you are judging everyone!"
2960,"Finding a husband isn‚Äôt going to cure all your problems the way you think it will.  


You need to find a therapist to help you deal with the horrible abuse you suffered as a child.  That is, a therapist who properly understands abuse issues."
2961,Your husband makes me uncomfortable whenever you bring him around and that‚Äôs part of why I stopped hanging out with you. You‚Äôre not happy with him and are more outspoken when he‚Äôs not in the room with us. You dance and laugh and drink but you can‚Äôt do any of that stuff when he‚Äôs by your side.
2962,What's the context? Lazy cattle farmer?
2963,"Oh man, are you me? I have a friend I love to death that does this exact thing. They were fired from the first ‚Äòprofessional‚Äô job they ever had due to their poor computer skills (stopped learning tech in the 90s; never been on the internet), but they think it was ‚Äòthat toxic place‚Äô and not the fact that their HR dept had to teach them how to type in a password on their 3rd day.

I have yet to think of a way to say this to them that they would hear."
2964,i couldn‚Äôt get in bed with someone who didn‚Äôt prioritise their own personal hygiene. sounds like torture!
2965,HAHAHHA NO
2966,Got a couple people in my life who need to hear this one too...
2967,Oof
2968,You should tell them that
2969,"I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I lie awake at night next to my ex thinking this. I couldn‚Äôt do it so he did it and it was just so good for the both of us. When you‚Äôre ready, you‚Äôll say it."
2970,"B bye

Maybe I'll see you in the next life"
2971,"I can guarantee that this person has super low self esteem and puts down others to feel better. However, not an excuse to be a judgemental asshole to other people"
2972,feel that
2973,*cough* my dad *cough*
2974,"For what it's worth, I've been thinking a lot of the same stuff. When you feel like it, I'm happy to talk about things in detail, and you don't need to worry about causing me pain."
2975,"If you ever feel ready, I suggest sending them a letter or email with pretty much those words.   


Although they might feel bad temporarily, it‚Äôs a LOT less hurtful than ghosting!   (From someone who has been ghosted.  I can deal with them not wanting to be my friend, but I wish they would‚Äôve said something).  


NOT to suggest it‚Äôs easy!   I‚Äôm struggling with something similar with a close friend.   Good luck!"
2976,"I hope you know that it is okay to leave people behind, that don't accept that they need help.

Its not your job to put up with that or having to help them. I am sure you tried helping them and they don't even realize they are in denial about something which drives them to those conspiracy theories. People won't accept that they have to change or get better, if they don't discover it on their own.  

Sometimes its better for all parties to just say goodbye and leave."
2977,How dare you hate on those shapeshifting aliens!
2978,"Thank you, I need to be reminded of that sometimes"
2979,"Hmm. Is this in the US? Because in my area, most churches are closed!"

2983,Jesus. Get rid of it!!!!  And the person that brought it home. Rude.
2984,"I absolutely love dogs, but... some people just aren't dog people.  No one should be forced to live with an animal they didn't consent to."
2985,"In my case it's my aunt. She worked in a childcare centre and pushed back against every update they had, then when she had to do her annual childsafe refresher online it was ""the final straw"". She's ranted to me about how ""parents don't want all that technology"" but dismissed me as being contrary every time I pointed out that I am a parent whose child did use childcare before school age and actually it's way quicker for me to scan my thumbprint on an iPad to sign her in on my way to work than it is to line up, find a pen because the last person walked off with it, then write down my name, time in and signature. It was also way easier for me to open an app on my phone and book an extra day if I had a conference on than it was to call up, wait on hold and do the ""let me see what we have available"" thing.

But nope, I was just being contrary. No parent liked those things."
2986,It didn't used to be this way. It's a depression slump. I'm not sure what to do about it.
2987,thank you <3
2988,"Not always true that it‚Äôs caused by low self esteem. it can just be engrained in some people to think and talk like that. My mother makes comments like that all the time and her self esteem isn‚Äôt low. It‚Äôs always bothered me how she can comment on relatives‚Äô weight etc when we get home. She‚Äôs even commented on my face when I have breakouts occasionally and I‚Äôm not sure why she thinks that‚Äôs ok. I think it can be more about wanting people to act like you would, and less about being insecure herself. I‚Äôve told her, if it didn‚Äôt bother me why did she have to comment on it and I cant remember what she said but she got VERY offended. People can think in strange ways"
2989,bingo was his nameo
2990,... oh shit. now i'm thinking twice about posting anything.
2991,Thanks. Yeah I‚Äôm slowly realising it‚Äôs going to have to come to that. Crazy to think after a decade
2992,"Yes, in the US."
2993,"depression doesn't excuse making literally zero effort. you should go easy on yourself, that much is true, but you still have to do the bare basics. pets need to be fed if you have them, you need to feed yourself , a basically hygienic and safe dwelling needs to be maintained (and by ''basically hygienic'' i really mean just a lack of terrible smells/bugs/rodents).

seriously, i've been very seriously depressed at times but there comes a point where giving yourself a pass (and others giving you a pass) to avoid doing the bare basics is the opposite of what you need to be doing. tell him this! if he can't do it for him, he can do it for you."
2994,Brah you‚Äôve gotta tell him to do it
2995,ah got you. hope it won‚Äôt last forever.
2996,"Have you tried just asking? Minimize it so it's not too painful to hear ""your breath is a bit wiffy, mind giving your teeth a quick brush for me?""   
but I know it can be really hard to hear criticism when dealing with depression as well. Good luck!"
2997,"Poor hygiene can be a symptom of depression.   (NOT to excuse it, btw).   Is your partner willing to talk to a doctor about the depression?   


(Not exactly easy right now due to current events!   But some doctor‚Äôs offices are offering telemedicine).  


Good luck!"
2998,Communication
2999,¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
3000,It is a tough spot and I get that it hurts. It is nothing you rush into but at some point its helping them and losing your own mental health. And you don't deserve that.
3001,We're great at communication. I just dont know how to tell him sensitively enough to avoid making him feel insecure.
3002,Meeting people that I have become long-term friends with and even fallen in love with.
3003,"Playing with friends I know in real tends to have the best results. I have met some good people playing Overwatch and FFXIV, but they've all been other women. We're pretty good friends now.

Men tend to be creepy unfortunately."
3004,"i meet a lot of nice people playing left 4 dead, i once ended up playing with some guys who were waiting for arma 3 to drop, they were all so hyped and they sounded like it was going to be the best game ever, we played a few days later again and they asked if they wanted me to join them for a op. i though what the hell and bought it and played.  

which started my 7 year addiction to arma.  

i don't think most guys are creeps just most of the loud ones are."
3005,Playing with people I know because everyone in a lobby is a creep
3006,"The only games I play online are MMOs. I did play Planetside 2 for a while, though.

My favorite experiences are helping new players or other players having a hard time. As an example during the initial rush when WoW: Classic released I spent most of my time helping other players with content I had either already done or hadn't done yet. I spent all my gold buying bags for noobs. My friends and I ran people through elite group quests. I lagged behind the leveling curve because of it and all my friends outleveled me quickly.

Sometimes people assume I'm a creep, which is funny but doesn't really deter me from being nice. But people frequently find a way to bring up how they have a boyfriend, assuming I'm not only a guy but also only being nice because I'm ""that guy"" that thinks helping somebody with an escort quest in Darkshore means I want to give them the D. I don't bother telling them I'm a happily married woman. I just keep on keepin' on."
3007,"I found a guild in WoW about 2-3 years ago now full of wonderful, mature people. I've had a lot of fun experiences since doing PvP, dungeons, and raiding with them. Everyone is quite positive about things and we're all 25+ with lives an families, so most of us are pretty like-minded. I've never once had a bad experience with them, which has been so refreshing.

Your friend isn't necessarily wrong about the creep thing though. The vast majority of my online gaming experiences, especially games with lobbies or voice, have included someone being a huge asshole or a creep. The only times I don't come across this is when I play with people I know. Occasionally I jump into a game with randoms where everyone's cool and kind, but it doesn't happen a lot. There's almost always at least one bad apple in the group. 

I've been online gaming for 20 years now and the thing that has been the most consistent over the years is that there are a lot of men that are awful to others in gaming, and it escalates even more if they find out there's a woman around."
3008,Destiny 2: Rise of Iron
3009,I only play with people I know and their friends. I spent many years playing League of Legends with a group that I became really good friends with.
3010,"I don't know what a lobby is.

There was the time when I was on a baby Tauren druid and sitting waiting for the zeppelin. A level 60 moo druid walked up and handed me 2g, saying that ""we druids should stick together"". It was so kind.

I was once running around on a level 20 or so? human warrior and a stranger called me over, then made me a full set of crafted armor. Now that I know how gear-dependent warriors are, that was REALLY nice of them and they must have felt so much pity for me lol.

Running up to unguilded lowbies and handing out bags is fun. Most of the alts and twinks won't take them on principle.

We decided to test ""seeding"" a raid instance for loot and went in super early. We made a campfire and spent hours playing with the WoW trivia bot and talking."
3011,Arma 3 is so much fun! My friends and I had such a blast when it first came out and played the heck out of it.
3012,‚ÄúHey can we talk‚Äù it gets me every time
3013,"‚ÄúHey can I ask you something personal?‚Äù üò¨ 

I just feel like I don‚Äôt know what the question will be at all and can‚Äôt  prepare for it."
3014,"""tell us a bit about yourself"""
3015,‚ÄúCall me as soon as you get out of work‚Äù
3016,"Any question that ends in a complement from men. For example, ""What are you up to, beautiful? ""How are you today gorgeous?""

I know I'm not going to like what comes after those kinds of questions."
3017,"""What are your career goals?""

I like my job right now and would like to move up in the org but it's not something I am super focused on. At the same time, changing my living circumstances, rent moving up etc makes me anxious about my financial future and I feel like I should be earning more than I am."
3018,‚ÄúWhy are you still single?‚Äù
3019,"""So you're Muslim?"" - I live in Europe and 90% of the time this leads into a lot of talking about religion, some is just curious but others are quite condescending. 

Just because we have different religions doesn't mean I want to talk about theology all the time."
3020,"I have a lot of very prominent scars on my upper left arm... I always get anxious when someone asks about them.
They are obviously bad enough as to indicate it‚Äôs from a trauma, and it‚Äôs sort of a trigger point for me. People‚Äôs lack of social awareness is really astounding.

I always say, ‚ÄúOh, those? Bear attack‚Äù... followed by a serious side eye."
3021,"""What are you thinking?"" That is a tough one for me because I don't like confrontation, I don't like hurting people's feelings, and I try to be honest at all times. I say things that I am comfortable saying, and there is almost always other stuff that I keep in my head to myself. So, when someone asks, ""What are you thinking,"" I feel anxious because they are accessing the private things I typically do not share."
3022,"""Do you have a boyfriend?"""
3023,Can I talk to you for a sec
3024,"When people do the math that I met my husband three years after my first kid was born and ask ""So where's her real dad?"""
3025,Can we talk?
3026,‚ÄúCan I say something?‚Äù Or ‚Äúcan I admit something?‚Äù I‚Äôm always terrified that someone‚Äôs gonna day they hate me
3027,Call me
3028,"""where do you see yourself in 5 years?"" makes me cringe and makes my heart feel like it's pounding out of my chest. For any managers out there, it's a stupid question. I get asked this annually during performance review time and always have to say some some PC version of the below (leaving out my health history because I'd rather it not be out there in my professional life)

I'm 8 years cancer free and when I was diagnosed my 5, 10, + year plans looked VERY different than where I am now. I'm happy, healthy and grateful for where I am now and honestly wouldn't have it any other way. But I'm painfully aware that sometimes you just have to roll with the punches. Shout out to Frozen 2 who said it best: ""just do the next right thing."""
3029,"""could you come over here for a sec please?""."
3030,‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù
3031,"What are you going to study at college/what college are you attending. I‚Äôm an au pair and decided to be one cause I don‚Äôt have the answer to those questions, still don‚Äôt."
3032,"""How are your folks?"" It only gets asked by people who don't really know me. I'm low contact with my parents but I often don't care to explain all that history, so I end up just making up some trite stuff and changing the topic."
3033,"""Why are you anxious all the time?"" 

I have anxiety (GAD) and depression. I've barely recognized my trauma these past two years. I get anxious whenever someone raises their voice or their mood shifts, cause I can FEEL IT. I am basically always in survival mode and ready to run"
3034,"""How are you?""

I hate small talk, and also I'm usually not doing great. No one actually wants an honest answer to that question. So you lie and say ""Fine, how are you"" and they say, ""fine"" and literally nothing was accomplished and what is even the point?"
3035,‚ÄúCan I ask you something?‚Äù
3036,"‚ÄúHave you got time to talk?‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you got a minute?‚Äù

When people aren‚Äôt specific about what they want to talk about I immediately think it‚Äôs bad news or I‚Äôve messed up somewhere."
3037,"That ""ding"" sound on an airplane. I will almost throw up every time I hear it now. I hate flying and we lived in Japan for 4 years and constantly flew home to visit my family. It always took like 3 days and tons of airports and flights and I just don't like the sound anymore because it reminds me of that."
3038,""" How tall are you? ""
I(F) am tall enough  and not very comfortable when I hear this question"
3039,"""So, you got a boyfriend yet?""


 No. No I don't. Please fuck off forever."
3040,"Not a question but ""I need to talk"" and ""I like you"" lead to sum sort of knee-jerk reaction"
3041,Why don't you have kids? Because my body hates me that's why.  I tell people I never wanted them but in reality my heart aches.
3042,"How old are you?

Just because your answer will create judgment no matter what it is."
3043,"Any variation on ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your PhD going,‚Äù ‚Äúwhen will you graduate,‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat are you going to do after you finish?‚Äù Because PhDs are really long and really hard and it‚Äôs difficult to get people to understand that it‚Äôs normal to be stressed and have periods of hating your research (even if it shouldn‚Äôt be), submission dates depend on a lot of factors and by the time you get there you‚Äôve had years to worry about what you‚Äôll do next without really being able to take tangible action. Also, because you live and breathe your PhD during your work hours so you don‚Äôt want to be reminded of it when you‚Äôre supposed to be having free time. But, mostly, because these questions are usually coming from people who care about you and mean well, so it feels bad to react poorly (internally) to people who are just trying to be nice."
3044,‚Äúdo you have time?‚Äù always feel like its gonna be something bad
3045,Why did you dropped out of school? Have you contacted the 911? Lol
3046,"‚ÄúCan we talk?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù"
3047,"What do you want to do with your degree? 
I don't know.  That's why I'm in university.  To figure out what I want to do.  But apparently I was supposed to know that already when I was 17 and applying for schools?"
3048,"My mom asking ""Why?"" after I decide to be honest with her about how I'm feeling instead of just saying ""Pretty ok, how are you doing?"" like I usually do. She always assumes it must be something serious, like a fight with my partner or not having enough money, but... no, mom, it's because my mental health just sucks the life out of me with each passing day."
3049," What time are you coming back, asked as soon as I drop my toddler with the grandparents. I normally do that if I have a couple of hours work to do and it‚Äôs an hour round trip. I usually estimate 3 hours from when I‚Äôve dropped her off. Guaranteed I would be stuck in traffic or I would experience a delay then get stressed calling them to tell them I‚Äôm running late."
3050,"The questions that my own brain asks me to keep me anxious. ‚ÄúHave you turned the iron off?‚Äù(it waits until I‚Äôm at the office); ‚Äúdoes he really love you?‚Äù; ‚Äúyou do know that it‚Äôs all your fault, right?‚Äù; ‚Äúso that‚Äôs like the fifth time this week you forgot to buy bread?‚Äù Aaaaaah, brain, fuck you."
3051,"""What are you making?"" 

My roommates are extremely  judgmental. If I make something with almond milk cause im lactose I'm looked at funny cause it's not ""real milk"". If I use turkey instead of ground beef to watch my health I get shit on. Cooking gives me anxiety in general."
3052,"‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that smell?‚Äù
I‚Äôm far from a hormonal smelly teenager anymore but I still panic and assume it‚Äôll be me who smells like an entire armpit. Even driving through a smelly part of the city has me nervous."
3053,"So I was born with crooked fingers, and a handkerchief thumb (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called). And I don‚Äôt like it when someone says, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with your fingers?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy do your fingers bend like that?‚Äù"
3054,We need to talk.
3055,The only appropriate response to this is ‚ÄúOh of course. We really have to to talk‚Äù. And then walk away.
3056,"Yes, this always freaks me out even though I rarely have a bad conversation with that starter. I blame my knee-jerk reaction on movies that often start with that and end in bad news."
3057,"mine too! my boss (a 50-something-year-old woman) hits me with this OR WORSE, ‚Äúwe need to talk‚Äù a lot lmao"
3058,"Oh this! Just ask the damn question. Chances are if I say no you‚Äôll either be
a) offended OR
B) you‚Äôll just ask me anyway

Might as well just ask the question. If it‚Äôs too personal my response will clearly let you know you crossed a line"
3059,‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
3060,"this. or ""what's a fun fact about you?"""
3061,Right! It's like no now I have to know right now
3062,"My mom does this and it sends me into a panic every time. I ask her what it's about and shes like ""Just call me"". I have begged her to stop doing that but she just keeps on lol"
3063,Not a compliment.
3064,"Ugh, I know! It feels so creepy and slimy."
3065,"whoa, not just from men!!!.... from women too. I'm a woman, so other woman coworkers somehow think it's fine to drop the ""beautiful lady"" or ""hey gorgeous"" into random work-related messages. And it's creepy.   


""Hey gorgeous! When you get a second can you update that invoice?""  


""Heya pretty lady - lemme know when you've got a moment to chat about this report!""  


Like what? No! Just because you're not a MAN doesn't make it ok to throw ""pretty lady"" and ""beautiful"" into our random work messages. It's weird."
3066,"ooh same here. Like, is it such a bad thing to be happy with how my job is right now, and not constantly be trying to climb higher and higher?"
3067,‚ÄúHow long have you been single?‚Äù
3068,I don't get why people get so fixated.  I started university almost two years ago now and one of my best friends from first year is Muslim.  The only time it comes up is (I love to bake or have friends over for food) is if I need to clarify which foods he can't eat.
3069,Hearing this at work is the worst.
3070,Oh my god! How can anyone think that‚Äôs OK to say to someone?
3071,I'm 31 but everyone tells me I look 25. I've been told more than once that I don't look old enough to have a 10 year old kid.
3072,"I hate this question too. I‚Äôm 19 but my partner who I live with is 25, and some people judge that. 
I also feel like people stop taking me seriously when they meet my age.

I‚Äôm kind of an old soul, trauma grew me up real fast, along with the pressure of being the ‚Äúoldest girl‚Äù in my family, sometimes I had more responsibility than my older brothers, who are 4, 6, and 8 years older than me. 
At 13 my mom made me take over dinner planning. We ended up taking turns when it was obviously way too much for me. 
Whenever I was given more chores, I‚Äôd ask why and the answer was always ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the oldest daughter, you need to be prepared to be a homemaker.‚Äù 

Yes I grew up in a very sexist home. Yes I was abused. Yes I was told how to prepare for marriage by the time I was 7, (mostly how to be a good submissive quiet wife, submitting to my authority aka men). 

When my dad found out I was self harming he yelled at me, accusing me of copying a friend for attention. He said it wasn‚Äôt normal so there must be a reason beyond depression. 

So when, at 18, I discovered the world outside of religion and sexism and conservatism etc., I fell in love with the man who helped pull me out of it. My parents kicked me out at 18 because I would not, I shit you not, repent for sleeping with him, apologize to my mother for not being a virgin, and promise to go to church every week and stop having sex, stop smoking weed, and he literally said, ‚Äúyou have no autonomy in my house.‚Äù 
Three days later I moved out/was officially kicked out. 

Not many people know this backstory. 
Not many people know how bad I had it. 
So people are quick to judge and assume I‚Äôm like other teens who still have the leisure of time and financial stability in their parents, etc. 

Yes, I‚Äôm 19. 
But I‚Äôm supporting myself. 
I‚Äôm healing still. 
I‚Äôm financially independent from my parents. 
Yes, I‚Äôm 19. But I‚Äôm not an impulsive, dumb, inexperienced kid."
3073,Ikr and in past relationships that‚Äôs what was always said before something bad happened. Now my boyfriend is like ‚Äúhey can we talk‚Äù I nervously agree and he‚Äôs just like ‚ÄúI miss you baby‚Äù...HUH MY HEART ALMOST GAVE OUT YOU CAN‚ÄôT SAY THAT
3074,Yes!! It‚Äôs like as soon as the question is asked there is absolutely no winning either way.
3075,Since birth
3076,Thank you! The world needs more people like you.
3077,"My answer is that her real dad *is* my husband. The man who enthusiastically embraced that role in her life when he could have just stopped dating me when he learned he'd have to do dad stuff like so many other guys. As for her *biological* father, it doesn't matter where he is. Neither me nor her needs him."
3078,I‚Äôm 36 and no kids but don‚Äôt not want them.
3079,"Perfect response, and absolutely true."
3080,"""Don't not?"" So, you want them but just haven't had them yet? If that's the case, I'm a very firm believer that babies can only arrive at the right time. It's never too early or too late in your life. They can't come at any time but the right time."
3081,I didn‚Äôt mean to prompt this but it‚Äôs exactly what I needed to hear. Thank you for reminding me.
3082,No problem! I have faith. You're gonna be an amazing mom some day.
3083,I have fine oily hair so I wash it every other day. It just gets too oily and gross looking otherwise.
3084,"every 3-5 days, i love the freshly washed hair feels but hate the process of washing/drying"
3085,"Pre-quarantine, basically everyday...now, a whole lot less than I would like to admit"
3086,Washing my afro is a tad bit different. Co-washing (washing with conditioners)  my hair every week or every other week is what is recommended. Shampooing usually only ever happens once or twice a month. 4c afro (The tightest curl type) doesn't create its own oils as often as other hair types. I love my hair and although taking care of it is hard it rewards me with bouncy healthy coils! Don't be afraid to ask questions cause I'd love to answer them. (:
3087,"Every 2 to 3 days, pretty much. I don't prefer washing my hair every day because my hair takes an extremely long time to dry and style."
3088,1-2 times a week. It‚Äôs just better for it. Looks nicer too.
3089,"Every 3 or 4 days. My hair stays pretty clean, it‚Äôs a waste of time to dry and style it everyday, and my hair holds curls really well so there‚Äôs no point to wash it everyday and lose out on sleeping in a little bit."
3090,"I used to do it every day, but now since I‚Äôm not leaving the house I do it every other day"
3091,"Lately, around every 3-4 days, but it used to be every 6-7. I‚Äôve been washing my hair more often because I cut it short and have been wearing it down more often (since it doesn‚Äôt go up as easily). When it was longer, I could get away with wearing it up if it was a little too greasy. 

I started going longer without washing originally because I had an unnatural hair color that required dying, and since I did it myself I wanted to make sure my hair color lasted as long as possible, so I didn‚Äôt wash too often. Then when I had to bleach out the color I wanted to be as kind as possible to my hair through the process so I didn‚Äôt over wash it or over heat it."
3092,1x a week. I've had long and thick hair since I was a kid and this works best for me.
3093,Every day.  I feel dirty if I don‚Äôt.
3094,Caucasian dry frizzy curly hair. Condition in shower and after every day but only wash once a week.
3095,"Every 2-5 days depending on how oily it feels, in non quarantine condition 2-3"
3096,Everyday because I work out everyday :/
3097,"Currently washing once a week. I have really fine hair and it looked awful if I didn't wash every day, but I was getting really dry scalp and ends. I've been trying to slow down the oil production so for the past three weeks I switched to once a week. After day two I have to start wearing it up, but I have already noticed a significant change."
3098,"Twice a week. I have extensions, so it's really cumbersome to detangle and dry my hair. Plus, my scalp doesn't produce as much oils anymore."
3099,Every other day
3100,"Once every 1-2 weeks, depending on how my hair looks/feels."
3101,every 2-3 days
3102,Twice a week with dry shampoo on second or third day to help from looking so oily.
3103,3 times a week anything more will dry out my hair
3104,Probably 2-3 times per week. I have longer hair so it's not something I have time and attention to devote to more than that. I also don't think it's necessary or a good idea to overdo it with shampoo.
3105,"Daily, sometimes every other day. It gets oily by day 2 or 3, and I want it to smell nice."
3106,Once or twice a week
3107,"Every other day. I‚Äôm a white woman with curly hair, but I don‚Äôt worry too much about maintaining my curls, otherwise I‚Äôd probably use more product and wash a little less frequently"
3108,"like once every 2 days, it gets greasy if i go more than that without washing, but i definitely don‚Äôt do it daily since my hair is thin and is bleached towards the bottom (ombr√© look)"
3109,I used to wash my hair everyday but because it‚Äôs coloured now I can only wash it every three days to prevent it from drying out. Honestly washing your hair everyday and waking up with  a clean fresh scalp is the nicest thing.
3110,Once a day or every other day. My hair gets super greasy if I dont
3111,I usually wash it every day since I work out and get sweaty every day. But lately? Oh boy...
3112,"Every 3-4 days! My hair gets SUPER greasy so I use dry shampoo üëåüèº whoever invented that, god bless you"
3113,2-3 times a week. I do it every other day Monday to Friday. It gets yucky on the weekend but I can feel my hair healing!
3114,twice a week to save my poor damaged hair
3115,"Every 4-5 days. Any more and my hair gets damaged, dry and frizzy. Any less and my hair starts looking oily at the roots and I have to put it up. I have naturally thick, dry, curly hair, so less is more."
3116,i do every day because for some reason it just physically feels uncomfortable to me. and also looks really flat
3117,every week cus that‚Äôs normal for my hair type
3118,"Every second day. My hair is thick and gets greasy fast, like I really should wash it every day it's that bad. I have tried washing it much less for a few weeks and it was just a nightmare and didn't get any less oily and I find dry shampoo doesn't really do much for me after day 2 unless I use heaps and then I just feel more dirty.

I don't wash my hair every day because it's long and I'm lazy but also because I dye it and it fades too quickly."
3119,"Every other day. It gets oily (and more importantly, smelly) beyond that, but washing every day isn't necessary for me. My hair is thick and I wear it up every day, so it would spend most of its time damp lol."
3120,Every other day. If I‚Äôm not working sometimes every 3 days. When I‚Äôm sick it‚Äôs sometimes 4 days.
3121,"I have to do it every day. If I don't, my scalp becomes oily and starts to itch plus I get major dandruff on the top. I'm not sure if it's because my scalp gets too dry because I wash it every day lol, but it's a hard cycle to stop. 

If I use dry shampoo, my head feels dirty and heavy."
3122,"I use a frequent wash shampoo so usually 5 times a week because I did high intensity workouts 5 times a week. Otherwise on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays"
3123,Once a week. Twice sometimes. Why? Because I'm lazy.
3124,"Every 3 days or every other day at the most, depending on what I‚Äôm up to. Multiple hairstylists encouraged me to stop washing daily, and use dry shampoo on non-wash days. The texture of my hair became incredibly silky after doing so."
3125,Twice a week. I have fine thick hair past my shoulders and I don't particularly like the washing and drying part. Thank goodness for dry shampoo and braids to keep it out of my face!
3126,"Twice a week. Once using shampoo, the other time co-wash only."
3127,"Every three days, mainly to retain my blonde balayage, to save on product and shower time."
3128,Daily because of exercising!
3129,Every 3-4 days because that's when it looks and feels like it needs it.
3130,"I had to wash my hair daily because it looked oily and gross if I didn‚Äôt - until I ran across a YouTube video that suggested putting salt (1 teaspoon in a large bottle) in my shampoo. It worked!

Now, I wash every other day."
3131,Every 2-3 days. It gets oily about that time.
3132,"Every other day, because that's all it needs more of the time. And I'm lazy."
3133,"Once a week, if that. Idk if I have something hormonal going on, but I have incredibly dry skin, don‚Äôt sweat, etc"
3134,"Once or twice a week.  I use dry shampoo when I don‚Äôt wash it though. For me it‚Äôs mainly because I hate dealing with wet hair, it‚Äôs such a hassle. Also I‚Äôm naturally a brunette but my hair is dyed blonde-ish so not washing it too much helps keep it healthy and strong."
3135,"once or twice a week depending on how it feels.
i have curls (type 3)

but i usually dont have time either for such a laborious styling routine so it works"
3136,"It used to be pretty much every day, back in pre-quarantine times.  At least co-washing if not actually washing it.  Dry shampoo doesn't really work for my hair.  

Now that I'm not leaving the house, I only wash it if I have a video call with work, or I've exercised (Ring Fit Adventure can get sweaty.)"
3137,Every other day. If I wait longer it's too oily or has kinks from tying it up. I condition it every day though
3138,Almost every day because most days I work out so I end up sweating a lot. Sometimes I skip a day or two if i haven't been sweaty those days.
3139,"I have fine hair. I don't know if it's oily or not, and how often I wash really depends on which shampoo I'm using. Some leave a lot of residue behind and my hair looks oily and gross by the following day. Some don't, and I can get away with a dry shampoo on day 3 then wash again on day 4.

Right now I'm using The Honest Company lavender shampoo+body wash. It doesn't leave my hair greasy OR dried out, whether I wash daily or every other day."
3140,Every day. My hair is super fine and not a lot of it. It just gets too itchy and oily if I don't. Yet if you touch my hair it's always super soft so washing it daily doesn't damage it for me.
3141,"Every 2-3 days. I avoid doing it more often because (1) it will get damaged quicker and (2) it will get more oily of washed more often. The third day it doesn't look very good, but I try to be patient."
3142,"Typically every 2 days but with being at home and not hitting the gym, it's been every 3-4 days.  I have very long and thick hair so it's a bit of a pain to dry so if needed, I use dry shampoo."
3143,"Twice a week.  I used to wash it daily, but gradually tapered down to what I do now and it works quite well for my hair."
3144,"i wash my hair every 5-6 days.

they never look greasy ever so you can't tell what day i'm on :)"
3145,I used to wash my hair every other day but I've managed to reduce it to every 3-4 days instead. I think using a better quality shampoo and conditioner has helped.
3146,"Once every week. My hair isn't oily and whilst I live in a tropical country, I dont practice washing it everyday because itll thin it out. I love it"
3147,"I wash my hair every other day, sometimes less. I live in a very dry climate and over washing here will dry you out."
3148,"I stopped using shampoo months ago and my hair has never looked better.  It is fine and color-treated to a dark brown to cover grey but it use to get oily at the scalp and dry toward the ends.  My hairdresser suggested that I start giving it a really good rinse and scalp massage with plain water and then ""shampoo"" it with straight conditioner.   The first 2 weeks were definitely ponytail days but then everything adjusted seemingly overnight.  My hair is soft and shiny and the color no longer fades between touch ups.  I can't imagine ever using shampoo again!"
3149,2 to 3 times a week
3150,"I'm convinced that people who tell me I shouldn't shampoo my hair (and that my hair will eventually become nice and non-greasy after I stop washing it) are actually just getting accustomed to their own hair being unwashed, lol.   


Ok maybe not really, but I wash my hair every day. I've spent times where I've let it go days between washing, weeks if I've been at the cottage during summer, and honestly, my hair is just 100% better when I wash it every day. There's no amount of ""training my hair/scalp"" that even comes close to having freshly shampoo'd clean hair."
3151,"About every 3 days, I have long hair and I dyed it so it doesn't need to be washed that often.  If I work out a lot or get sweaty then I may wash it more often."
3152,About once a week. More often when it's warm. Sometimes less often if I'm lazy. I have dry and curly hair so the only way you can tell I haven't washed it in a while is that my curls aren't as defined.
3153,"Every morning in the shower, no exceptions. My hair feels dirty on the rare occasion I have needed to skip a day."
3154,"Roughly every 3 days, sometimes 4 if I can get away with shoving my hair in a bun. I‚Äôve recently cut it shorter though so have to wash it more as I can‚Äôt hide it as easily lol"
3155,Usually every 3 days ish
3156,"Fall/winter/spring every three days or so. 
Summer I leave it naturally curly and shampoo day one, rinse day two, cowash days three through whenever it feels like it needs shampoo, maybe every three weeks or if I swim in the lake. 

Quarantine hair washing is about every 7 days apparently."
3157,"I wash them everyday.
I know. 
""It's bad"" blah blah."
3158,"Yeah, I wash it once or twice a week. I use dry shampoo or even regular baby powder and it doesn‚Äôt look greasy. I have thin hair though and it can be dry. I use a biotin shampoo product and a conditioner with black castor oil."
3159,"At least every second day because if I leave it any longer than that, it looks greasy and horrible."
3160,Hair dressers here recommend once or twice/per week.
3161,"About once a month. It gets dry easily and the process of datangling, washing, and styling takes several hours."
3162,My hair is curly so I wash it about once every two weeks.
3163,Every day. I seriously don‚Äôt understand how on Earth anyone can go more than a day without washing their hair. The greasy feel makes my skin crawl.
3164,"Twice a week, I trained my hair to be able to withstand that many days in between washes. Helps with hair loss and keeping the natural oils on my scalp is good for you"
3165,"Every day, shampoo on the roots, conditioner on the tips. The top/back of my head will get super oily within a day otherwise. Besides, I'm already in the shower and it won't hurt me, so why not?"
3166,"I have strong, oily long hair, to the bottom of my back. I wanted it to be healthy because I wanted to donate my hair again. I used to wash it every even day, but it was very oily and the ends split a lot. Then, because of my job and lack of time I started to wash ot less (I also changed my shampoo to one without silicones and sulphates) and notized my hair was healthier and less oily. 
Now I only wash it once a week. It becames oily in the 5th day, but apparently no one notized (I asked). It saved me a lot of time, the ends don't split AT ALL and it falls less."
3167,"I have the same problem, but it's every day. I've tried for SO LONG to get to every other day, I went about five months doing every other day, and it was always disgusting by about mid-day on the second day. No dry shampoo could help, just went from looking oily to looking dirty and gross. My sister has gorgeous hair that is down to washing once or twice a week (max). It looks like hair you'd see on a Tresseme commercial. 

I've tried everything people recommend, different products, shampoos, etc. Some of us just get hair that needs washing every day."
3168,There is a solution to this
3169,Same
3170,"Same. Takes forever to dry too, so minimal washing."
3171,"I mean, different hair textures and even ethnicities can affect how often you wash your hair. I‚Äôm a black woman with curly, coarse/thick hair and my hair just doesn‚Äôt get greasy. I‚Äôd have to go months without washing for it to even get the tiniest bit greasy."
3172,"I was that same way, but it takes time to train your hair to produce less oil. I‚Äôm up to 3 days between washes. I started out everyday then did every other day for a couple weeks then you add a day every couple weeks."
3173,"Actually it varies across hair type. Oily hair can be washed everyday, **not** dry hair! 
Especially not for people who suffer from scalp psoriasis/eczema."
3174,"For me it was like acne, the most I treated ot, the more I jad. The same with oily hair. Is better when you leave it alone. Also, it helps to use shampoo without sulfates and silicones, because in the end they get your hair dirty"
3175,"I used to have hair like yours. I eventually got it down to once per week. Feel free to disregard this , but what helped me was protective hairstyles the first day. Like French braids or similar.

That being said, if you like washing your hair every day and it makes you feel good, there's nothing wrong with it."
3176,"I want to add to the other answers that maybe is the shampoo. I used to buy those expensive brands, and it was always oily and I had dandruff. Now I wash it once a week with no silicone, no sulfate shampoo and is clean and nice until the 5th day.
I also advise to wear a silk cap while sleeping, to prevent damaging your hair on your sleep, and buy a wood comb, because plastic ones can damage the hair."
3177,">  I've tried for SO LONG to get to every other day, I went about five months doing every other day, and it was always disgusting by about mid-day on the second day. 

in this era of very mild shampoos, the ''overproduction in response to shampoo frequency'' thing is dead. if you need to wash it daily, that's because your hormones/genetics are pumping that much oil out of your head and there's nothing to do but wash it out :)"
3178,"I'd just like to add, i found when i use lush shampoo bars i found i could go ages without washing. They do take about two months for your hair to become used to it though. Putting a mask of honey through my hair before washing seemed to help during those times though and made my hair super shiny."
3179,"Former hairdresser here. What's happening is you have accustomed your hair to be washed everyday, stripping them of their natural oils.

Washing your hair every day is really not good for your hair and hence why they are so greasy. They NEED to be washed everyday because you got them used to that(sounds stupid but its true)

edit; downvoted for saying the truth? cool."
3180,Yep I can leave mine a good month before it gets a tiny bit greasy. I have a big mop of black wavy  hair - I'm part Sri Lankan. I go to the hair dresser once a month and they do it.
3181,That's what I tried. French braids with headbands to keep it back and keep from touching it.
3182,I've used silicone and sulfate free products for years :( And my hair is very smooth and soft and doesn't get messed up or damaged when I sleep.
3183,I think you might be right.
3184,I actually used to use Lush bars! I really like them but they didn't have any impact on how often I needed to wash my hair.
3185,"I know it's not good for my hair, that's why I tried (for five months!) to go every other day or less, but it never worked and always looked disgusting.

I think I just produce wayyyy wayyy more oil than most."
3186,"Have you checked if you are allergic, sensitive to some chemicals or some other medical condition? Oily hair can also be caused by hormonal imbalance which most people don‚Äôt know, it can be worth checking out!"
3187,"Yeah, no hormonal issues and no chemical sensitivity. It's just...how my hair is."

3189,"My ex tried to tell me that the reason I thought he was cheating on me was because of my diagnosed but untreated anxiety and depression. The depression was 'lowering my self esteem' and the anxiety was making me paranoid and making me believe things that weren't true. He had me convinced that my mental illness was getting worse and worse and was sabotaging our otherwise perfect relationship. He played the role of hurt but understanding and supportive boyfriend who tried everything to help me get better, including offering to pay for the therapy I couldn't go to anymore because I had lost my job and insurance.

Nope. He was cheating. Had been for months."
3190,"He cheated on me with a guy. He tried to call me homophobic and clingy. Cheating is cheating, dude."
3191,"My now ex boyfriend offered to buy me a ring (for regular jewelry wear, not an engagement ring)

I said no, I rather he get me a simple casual necklace I was eyeing if he wanted to gift me something. He insisted ‚Äúno, I liked that ring you were looking at earlier, I wanna buy it for my girl‚Äù 

I said ok, thinking it was kinda odd because he never did things like that. I accepted, naively thinking we were in a good spot and he wanted to get me a ring. 

Not even two weeks later, I find out he‚Äôs fucking some other girl and met her parents. I brought up the ring and was like ‚Äúwhy the fuck did you buy me this then?‚Äù because it had meant at the time he got the ring he was clearly talking to this other girl. Then he hit me with the ‚Äúyou begged me to get that ring for you‚Äù when I clearly DID NOT. And I offered an alternative, cheaper jewelry option (a cute $30 choker necklace). But nope, he insisted that I begged for a ring, I practically forced him to get it for me. I felt like I was going insane because I had distinctly remembered how it went down. I told it to him exactly what happened, and he told me I was crazy and dismissed everthing I said because he couldn‚Äôt admit he was lying"
3192,"My ex. He'd say things, loud and clear, to my face, then when I'd mention it (even the same day) he'd look at me like I was completely nuts. Like mortified/horrified at how completely insane I was. To the point where I actually started questioning whether I WAS in fact insane.

Gaslighting. Fun for all."
3193,"My ex once tried to convince me that I had Aspergers because I suspected he was cheating. 

Well, only one of us turned out to be right and it was me."
3194,"Not so much crazy, but making my worries sound irrational and insulting. I was uncomfortable with my boyfriend at the time meeting up with his former high school student (this is days after he left the school, she still had 5 months till graduation) and he became upset and justified it by saying she has depression and because of that lost most of her friends so she needed a positive role model. He made sure to throw in that he knew basic student/teacher conduct and not to worry he would keep it professional. I think you can all guess how that ended."
3195,"I had an ex plant a pair of his underwear in my laundry (we didn‚Äôt live together) and accuse me of cheating. Asked me for weeks whose it was. I had seen him wear that pair before but every time I‚Äôd say that he would say, ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt buy that colour.‚Äù 
My mom put it best when she said, ‚ÄúWell no one else is fat enough to fit in those regardless.‚Äù"
3196,"My ex-husband used to refuse every idea I had until I happened to pick the one he wanted, then claimed we discussed our ""joint"" decisions.  When I told him that I didn't get to make any decisions in our relationship he told me I get to pick what we have for dinner everyday, but he had already given me a list of things he didn't want me to make.  He bought me clothing that was way sexier than what I wanted our my lifestyle of a mom with small kids.  He would be insulted if I tried to return them and he complained if I bought clothes because I had drawers full of clothes I didn't feel comfortable wearing.  The result is me wearing crappy left over t-shirts and sweats, and he complained about that too.

He never said I was crazy, he just kept insisting that what he wanted was reasonable and by implication, if I didn't want that too I was unreasonable.

I'm so glad I'm free of that bullshit.  I shouldn't have to fight to simply exist as an equal.  Life is much better now, even if it's harder."
3197,"My ex tried to tell me the reason I thought he was cheating on me was that we watched MadMen right before bed, so it was in my head all night. Spoiler: He was cheating."
3198,"I had an ex who, for literal years, would try to put me down/make me look foolish in front of our mutual friends after I broke up with him. Sometimes he‚Äôd be outright mean and nasty, other times he‚Äôd make mean comments but phrased like a joke, and occasionally he‚Äôd try to publicly accuse me of being a horrible person. It was infuriating because when I‚Äôd confront him about it he‚Äôd ‚Äúapologize‚Äù (usually) and then go right back to being a jerk again. I couldn‚Äôt always confront him because he‚Äôd make it sound like a joke, even though it wasn‚Äôt, so me calling him on it would‚Äôve enabled him to turn it on me further. I eventually got him to stop, but in the meantime all our mutuals thought he was the greatest thing since sliced bread and I was super confused as to why they didn‚Äôt see how much he was openly a jerk."
3199,"My ex-boyfriend's iPad had iMessage installed, meaning you could easily see texts to his phone on it. One day I walk in, pick up the iPad and see that he has been texting and sending pictures to a girl that he hooked up with in college over 10 years ago. 

I called the girl and calmly told her that my ex was still in a relationship with me. She tells me she's sorry. 

I confront him about the texts and he goes wild, screaming that I am invading HIS privacy when he left the iPad in plain view. When he finds out that I called the girl, he goes ballistic and tells me to delete her number and put my stuff into garbage bags because he's going to call the police and get a restraining order on me if I refuse or attempt to contact the girl again. The icing on the cake is when I return to my apartment to find my keys missing from my lanyard...apparently he thought he would be one step ahead of me if he took his house keys to prevent me from re-entering. Idiot took the keys to MY apartment instead and so I ended up sleeping in my car. 

TLDR: ex-boyfriend cheated and then tried to paint me as a dangerous scorned woman on the spot when I'm actually a pretty chill, somewhat introverted woman who wouldn't hurt a fly. 

I can tell this story and laugh now because he attempted to get in touch with me a year later and now I'm engaged to a great guy. So joke's on him."
3200,"My ex made me feel crazy for thinking he relapsed and was cheating, I got extreme anxiety and would have panic attacks so I thought it was me. I started going to therapy. Turns out my ex had relapsed and had cheated (if only verbally) more than a few times."
3201,"Where to start!!!!

My ex calling me crazy because he told me he wanted to kill me and me being frightened was being ""crazy"". 

Me voicing my opinion and being labelled "" crazy"". 

Finding my ex boyfriend was cheating on me but I am "" crazy"" because he didn't do it.... There was literally photos."
3202,My father flapping his hands in front of his face making brutelike noises to mock my hands trembling from anxiety
3203,"My ex was a real hardcore narcissist and would do cowardly, self-serving and inconsiderate shit on a regular basis and then make me feel ridiculous and dramatic for getting upset about it, and would then throw our age gap in my face (he was 12 years older than me, 20 and 32 at the time). It really made me feel for the first time like I was this over emotional and unreasonable little girl when my entire life I had been praised for being wise and emotionally mature beyond my years. It really fucked up my perception of myself and my trust in my own judgement, anyone who‚Äôs been with a narcissist knows the insanity of having it beat into your head that you‚Äôre wrong when in your GUT you know you‚Äôre right and something is very very wrong with the relationship and the person you‚Äôre with. So grateful to be way beyond that and with a man who treats me as a beloved, intelligent equal."
3204,"Found a text on my ex‚Äôs phone from his ex (who he dated literally 12 years ago) that said ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt our sex life be just between us‚Äù, while he was dating me. 

He told me this is just a common phrase used, and it didn‚Äôt mean anything üôÑüôÑüôÑ"
3205,My dad any time I disagree with him.
3206,"I get this all the time on social apps. Guy says ""Hey beautiful/sexy"", I ask them not to flirt as I'm not looking for that sort of thing, and immediately they insist they were just being nice, and that I just don't know how to take a compliment"
3207,"I got an ex that became absolutely insane when I found out he was having a relationship with another girl, while he was studying abroad and still dating me since years. I tried to warn her, as it wasn't the first time he did this to me but he was already ahead of me, having groomed her saying that his ex (sic) was extremely jealous and insane so that I would be pretending to still be in a relationship with him. He became insane, threatened me and my family, wanted to kill my cats and burn my house, had his friends call me and send me death threats, all the girl friends of the girl teamed against me, as he was the perfect boyfriend and so nice. It was a nightmare for me, to have so many proofs and nobody believing me. I went to the police, as I was harassed and had serious anonymous death threats on my family and I, they did nothing. 

His mom even sent me an email saying I needed to be locked up in a mental asylum and that I should beg on my knees for forgiveness as I am destroying their family. She couldn't bear that her precious son, who was always in trouble with law enforcement and people, was again lying to her, because he would never do that, of course. 

This guy, that was my childhood best friend, was in fact the textbook narcissist, always playing the victim and losing all sanity when losing control on something he thought to be the perfect crime. 

I was so innocent at the time, I didn't see nor understand that he was so bad and so manipulative for so many years. Honestly, that scarred me for life and now that I regained strength (was 7 years ago) if I see the fucker, I will simply kill him."
3208,The ones who tried to justify sexually assaulting me.
3209,"When I confronted my ex after he raped me. 

When it happened, I froze and couldn‚Äôt stop crying. I drove home and felt completely numb. It took me a couple days to comprehend what had happened. When I went to confront him, he kept telling me ‚Äúif that‚Äôs what you want to believe, then fine‚Äù. I stood there feeling like I was making a huge deal out of nothing but I tried my best not to show that on my face. It still infuriates me to this day"
3210,"My ex-husband was gas lighting me saying I was controlling when I pleaded with him to not go to Vegas alone with another girl because it will likely mean the death of our marriage and our family unit (we had a 9 month old infant). He said along the lines of ""this is exactly what I mean, you are so controlling! I have to go to find myself again, I have to do this. We will work on our relationship when I am back"". Obviously, that was the end of our relationship and family. He is now a (likely proud) deadbeat dad too. For whatever reason, I could never get him to see the blessing that our child is. I should have realized that I should never need to explain this to a parent. 

This is after a 10 year relationship, planned pregnancy and we're both in very stable careers so we had no financial stressors. 

It has now been 7 months since and I am now on a beautiful spiritual journey, about to graduate with my Master's degree and have my beautiful 16 month old baby girl, all to myself. The future is so bright when no one is there blocking the sun light!"
3211,"Not me, but I was there in the moment. My mother saw something on my dad's phone and told him he was cheating. My dad said it wasn't true and that my mother was being paranoid. He then told me about some man who apparently would flirt with my mum. It turns out it was true. He was having an affair with someone 4 years older than me. But, for some reason my mother wonders why I'm single."
3212,"Just the other day a bunch of guys on tumblrinaction fervently tried to tell me that domestic abuse was equally divided between men and women, as in 50% of the victims are male and about 50% of the abusers are female. They claimed nearly all sources were ""inaccurate"". I asked what source they said was accurate and they provided one source. I clicked the source they provided and it said domestic abuse victims are 73% female 27% male. They then claimed rape is 50% committed by women against men. I said even if that was true, which is flagrantly is not, that is not how statistics work and does not prove their original argument about domestic abuse. They then claimed I was claiming rape wasn't abuse and that I was crazy and irrational. By then I'd already stated that I was pulling out of the argument as the facts were incontrovertibly on my side and it actually wasn't a debate, it was an unhinged and factually incorrect monologue. They kept going without me."
3213,"He said feminists deserves to be raped when I told him I was one. 

This charming specimen further added feminists are lonely ones who needed a good dicking. This guy had a girlfriend. I hope she left him shortly after because clearly he doesn't believe she deserves to be a human being."
3214,"Having dated a bred to the bone narcissist ... this is my time to shine! So many great examples but the ones that immediately come to mind. The house was his and he had convinced me to move in. I didn't make much money so I was told I just needed to do more of the housekeeping. Fine I think... for the next year it was a moving target of things that I didn't do. I never knew WHAT that thing might be until I was in trouble for not doing. I finally got fed up and decided that if I can't keep up maybe I'll just offer to give him physical money. This started a fight (and we NEVER fought). I tell him that I'm frustrated. He tells me that I just need to try harder. I tell him I need an actual list of chores in order for me to achieve what he wants. He tells me that I should just know. I tell him that I would rather pay for more things if this is how it's going to be. He says that's not what we agreed to... I say, ""so then you've put me in this corner and given me no way to succeed and just intend to keep punishing me for it."" He suddenly loses his shit and starts screaming, ""I work 40 hours a week!"" I remind him that so did I. This sends him stomping upstairs yelling that he's not going to put up with my attitude and refuses to speak to me for hours. 

The other time was when he had finally done me the great honor of posting that he was officially in a relationship on FB. Three months later he's going back to school and I happen to notice that the ""In a Relationship"" tag is gone (or at least not visible). I happen to say I noticed it and asked why... and he flips out immediately. Yelling at me for being nosy and mistrusting. That he has no idea why it wouldn't be visible. Then he says he's going to delete all his social media now because I've made it too difficult to have it. The full dramatics... he's dug his laptop out and he's literally got his hand hovering over the keyboard to hit the ""OK"" to delete his profile. 

Looking back I just want to eye roll so hard but when I was in that relationship I constantly felt like I was never trying hard enough, trusting enough... something. Ridiculous."
3215,"I've talked pretty openly on reddit about my personal experiences, just with life, dating, etc. Getting told by men that I'm lying, imagining it, or making it up for attention is pretty darn common."
3216,"My ex verbally abused me and spewed the most acidious shit at me. When I got mad he justified it by saying I provoked him and compelled him to use that language and that I was mentally unstable and needed help. ""You made me do it, it's your fault I got upset"" LOL"
3217,"I've got an ex-boyfriend who put anyone's opinion over mine, he never listened to what I wanted and needed. Now I'm hearing that he's calling me crazy for basically standing up for myself.

Doesn't help that he's a gigantic liar and will twist anything so that he's not in the wrong..."
3218,"I want marriage, always have. Don't want to date for years without commitment, live together to 'test it out,' or want to be a decades-long girlfriend.... I brought it up early in dating, because why waste time if not.

Oooh, boy, the amount of men who thought that I was saying I want that 2 dates in *with them specifically* was insane. Or that I'm ""crazy"" or ""overbearing"" for articulating what I want... Beyond maddening. The idea that a woman should sit idly by while a guy decides the relationship status is deeply troubling, and I'd rather be alone than with a guy who is loath to commit. That. Is. Not. Crazy. Nor was I usually saying that about a specific dude, until I was, and it was with a guy who thought my candor and life-direction was refreshing."
3219,That he wasn‚Äôt talking to his ex but she posted a screenshot of her snapchat list and he was on there. Quite recently.
3220,"Many things my ex would do. But when I would try to talk about my feelings, our relationship, the huge issues we were dealing with. I got told I was crazy, annoying, over reacting, ridiculous, and so on."
3221,"Okay. This will make me sound obnoxious but... Whenever I explain my guy friends something political that they obviously get wrong, they tell me I am wrong. I try to explain them with historical examples, theories etc. And at the end all I get it is ‚Äúyou sound like lecturing me. You sound like you think you‚Äôre better than me‚Äù and I explain them I have a Bsc and MA degree in political science, let me be better than you. (Ofc i don‚Äôt think education is a prerequisite to be knowledged about sth) then i say, i am not lecturing, i am explaning. They never understand. They end up driving me crazy by constantly telling me how egoist i sound. I try to explain them they feel like I am patronizing because of their own mind telling them a woman cannot know better than them. They feel I am challenging their masculinity and then they say ‚Äúno I am not a sexist person‚Äù well, my friend, you are. My expertise is Chinese politics and one od my guy friend once tried to mansplain me how the CCP works... and when I told him of course i already know he said ‚Äúyou cannot handle someone knowing things‚Äù ughhh. And when I tell him this is mansplaining he says i am crazy to think he can be sexist. 

Whereas when similar thing happens with my girl friends, all I hear is ‚Äúwow i never thought that was the case. You do know a lot‚Äù"
3222,[removed]
3223,"My ex would invite me over to his house, and then tell his friends that I just showed up uninvited"
3224,""" Period pains aren't that bad. You are just overreacting. """
3225,"My ex used to tell me that something happened in a certain way and when I said it didn't he would complain about me ""constantly forgetting stuff"".

I did not understand what gaslighting was at the time but damn. What an ass."
3226,My ex was trying to make me seem crazy because I would share my feelings with him when things weren't going great. He ended up asking why I can't keep my shit bottled up like everyone else.
3227,"My ex (among MANY other antics) once started a fight with me because he ‚Äúknew‚Äù I was cheating. Pretty common abuser tactic, but the twist is he said he had pics of me kissing someone. Of course he did not, because I had not, but he had me up until 3 in the morning, crying and pleading and begging him to show me the pictures he insisted he had. He wouldn‚Äôt, and said he just wanted me to confess without seeing the evidence and then he could forgive me. 

He had me so beaten down that I was trying to remember a time when I‚Äôd ever been with this person in a situation that could have, from some wild angle, looked like kissing. 

The fight finally ended when I was so exhausted that I just shut down and went blank and he admitted that he made the whole thing up to see if I would confess something. I was so relieved to not be ‚Äúin trouble‚Äù anymore that I accepted this without argument. 

Now I look at that whole relationship and boggle that I put up with a single second of it"
3228,When my ex would do things he knew would piss me off just to get mad at me for being mad at him. So basically gaslighting me.
3229,"My ex continuously told me his cousins must have come into house while he was at work whenever I would find used pads and the same exact bright orange hair color that his ex had in the trash. K. And then he would always yell at me, threaten to break up with me, or scare me into submission so I wouldn't bring it up again even thouh it kept happening. He was a pathological liar, so i have like 100 more examples."
3230,"When one tells you to ""calm down"" when you are raging. There is mostly likely a real and justifiable reason you're that pissed and you have a right to that anger."
3231,"My first boyfriend texted me saying he was busy with family, then a minute later texted me again saying ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up Julia‚Äù... my name isn‚Äôt Julia.

But that didn‚Äôt mean he was cheating on me, just that I was ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù fuck I hate that guy, but I learned a lot.

There‚Äôs a special place in hell for guys who call women who don‚Äôt support their narrative.. crazy."
3232,"I just had a mild version of this. A dude I barely know, but know enough to stay away, slid in to my dms saying he‚Äôs lonely and really wants a cuddle. I say I‚Äôm in a relationship. He says ‚ÄúCongrats? I wasn‚Äôt suggesting you and I hook up.‚Äù

He absolutely knew what he was doing."
3233,"The one that tried to gaslight me literally right after sexually assaulting me. 
After it happened, I lay there in the dark totally dumbfounded, in tears, and he had the fucking audacity to say ""so now I'm the bad guy?"""
3234,"My ex used to ramble on about how hot his ex was and how good she was in bed.

I suffer from extreme insecurity and bad body issues.

I got really angry and upset at him and his defensive responses led me to cutting myself from the emotional pain i was feeling.

He called me crazy and told me to go to therapy.

I did go to therapy. And one of the first things she asked was ""if this is an issue between you and your partner why is it just you here"""
3235,"My ex told me 4 different versions of his childhood, where he grew up, lived, went to school, etc. I'd note the inconsistencies, they were pretty big, and he'd tell me he d never told me that, that this one was the right story, he d ask if I was okay and needed to go to the doctor and would say he was worried about it, other times he d just straight up deny and call me crazy.
Then when I called him out on this after the break up he said it never happened."
3236,"My ex tried to tell me I was crazy when I came home from Hawaii and suspiciously all my things were hidden. 

Shoes and clothes shoved under the bed and in closet, all of my possessions on the bookshelf thrown into the closet, all of lotions and skin care products shoved into the back of the shelving and covered with a towel in the bathroom, my ""feminine"" hand soap which was half full was replaced..

It was pretty obvious he had had someone over and was trying to hide the fact that I lived there but he bold face lied over and over, told me I was absolutely crazy for assuming that. Oh, he had no idea that him moving my skin care to the back of the shelf and covering it with a towel would make me go batshit. The things on the shelf? The cat jumped on the bookshelf, knocked it over, and instead of picking everything up he had supposedly just thrown it in the closet.

Eventually when I got in touch with his ex, she confirmed that it was her who had been over and yes, they did have sex in my bed.

Don't date a compulsive liar."
3237,"My first ex used to belittle me (about what I looked like, my race, and gender) and expect me to not say anything about it. When I started gaining the courage to call him out on his behavior, he‚Äôd tell me that I was ‚Äútoo serious‚Äù and ‚Äútoo hard on men‚Äù. That kind of halted my growth because then I started second guessing myself again, which allowed him to continue his cycle of emotional abuse. I eventually figured out that no matter what happened, I was always the one who had to comfort him even though he never did that for me. That made it easier to just break up with him and move on."
3238,"My best friend at the time accused me of ‚Äúonly going out to fool around with people‚Äù (which even if it were true was none of his business?)

Turns out he‚Äôd been keeping count of how many times I‚Äôd make out with someone when going out. When I called him out for 
A) being an asshole and 
B) not even getting his facts right 
He acted like I was the crazy one and he was right for giving me crap about it.
(Also he was convinced that he knew better what people I made out with and when even if he wasn‚Äôt even with me half the time)"
3239,"Not by men, but maybe this is okay anyway. I befriended two girls when I was about 15, they were 18 and in a relationship, living in a different country than me. We had common interests and would chat online all the time, we had so much fun. I would get on a plane and come visit them all the time.

I was younger and one person ""against two"", so I always felt the need to let them choose what we did, what we ate, etc. I never objected and it became normal that they decided everything when I was visiting and we still had lots of fun.

After a few years they would constantly message me about ""where I was"" or why I wasn't answering messages etc. If I didn't reply immediately on a chat, and remember, I was in a completely different country! Our common interest was being fans of a well known rock band, and if I bought a piece of band merch they would get really angry with me if I didn't wear it (I used to collect them). In fact, they would spend a lot of time telling me how I should live my life. I argued, but they would make me feel like I was being 'difficult'

One time I was visiting, one of the girls' mom died. She had taken her own life and we were the ones to find her. It was incredibly dramatic, and I was there for the whole aftermath. I even stayed longer than I intended, and had to come up with excuses to get time off work back home.

Fast forward to some months later and I was home, working, going to school and doing my own thing. The band we all loved announced they were playing a few gigs in Australia (we were in Europe). I had worked hard and saved up money so I could afford to go with a work friend of mine who shared the love of the band. We got tickets and were super happy. I messaged my friends abroad and asked if they wanted to join. They lost it. They completely lost it. How DARE I travel to go to a gig without them after one of them had JUST LOST THEIR Mother? how dare I go with a different friend? How dare I travel to see OUR band without them when they couldn't afford it. We video chatted for a whole night. They were furious, screaming. I was so horrified I tried my best to downplay this whole thing. I was still going. I want on the trip and I even bought a whole new phone and data plan so I could communicate with them throughout my trip.
They were still so hurt. I was lucky they were still talking to me. ""Australia"" was always a taboo subject hanging over us, even when a person with an aussie accent was around it was tense.

I moved in with them just a few months alter. Out of my country and in with them. They had complete control over me now, my living situation, I was isolated with tkem as I didn't know anyone else etc. We still had fun, but they were so angry with me when I did something wrong. If I dared have another friend they would be angry, if I had too much fun with one of them, the worst one would be angry at both of us. She was clearly some sort of narcissist.
I was wrapped up in that life for about 3 years before I finally left and got my own apsrtment in the same city and stated school. Life was so much better. Until they moved one street down from me, so they could visit all the time. And I could, too. I slowly distanced myself over time, but they clung more and more. The day I declined coming on a cross country trip with me, but they 'surprised' me with having already bought my tickets (so controlling), I said enough. I told them I wouldn't be their friend anymore and to leave me alone. It was a shit show of emails and a barrage of messages. And then silent. I had been so scared of what they would do if I left, but they just backed out. They knew it was too late. I'm sure they stalked me for a long time, I had seen how obsessive and crazy they would go on other friends or people they didn't 'like anymore'. I'm sure they still stalk me now. I moved back to my home country, met a lovely man and am engaged with a dog and am super happy now. So they can kiss my ass, because I barely even think of them anymore, and I know they might check my facebook daily and spew hateful things as they always did, never a positive outlook on life, never happy and nothing good enough for their controlling toxic little relationship, I don't care anymore. And Im so glad I can finally say that."
3240,"My ex told me I was always shutting him down. I reflected on this so for so long. I tried to figure out where I was doing this and how. As this goes against the very nature of who I am. I am open and communicative and always willing to discuss things.  Much to my detriment. If he had told me I talk too much, or my life was messy, or I was too emotional. Sure. I‚Äôm all those things.  

I mulled over this for days. Because I‚Äôm very big on self betterment. I was losing sleep thinking I was a terrible girlfriend. 


And then I realized... it‚Äôs because I disagreed with him.  All the examples he gave were of moments I said no, or I disagreed or or went against what he said. Like holy shit was that a lightbulb moment. 
I wasn‚Äôt shutting him down! His ego was doing that to him."
3241,"Ah I love this story.

I had a really good friend. He dated this psyco girl, for about 2 years then had a nasty breakup. We always were a bit flirty, so we started dating a few months later.
Things were great for a few months. One of the only guys I've ever said I love you to, or slept with. Thought I could trust him because honestly he was amazing. Had a cat, was high up in rotc, smart, had a steady job at 17, took care of his youngest siblings, all around on the outside perfect guy.

One day my best friend got her phone taken away by her parents. He was sweet and loaned her his phone. My friend being my friend when he got a text saying I miss you went snooping. It was under the name ""Mike"" we had no Mike in our friend group. It had some very sexual messages and some messed up stuff about me from the Mike side. So my friend dug deeper.

Found some pictures in his camera roll. Found a picture of him, naked in bed, with said ex. Now when she came to me about this it honestly broke me for a bit (thank God I got out of that spiral) we confronted him.

The jerk apologized for having pictures from their relationship still on the phone. Lied flawlessly. I honestly could have chosen to stay with him it was soooo believable. Made me think I was crazy for accusing him of cheating. I almost believed him. Then my friend piped up, thankfully, that he had OUR dog tags on in the picture. The ones with my name on them. The ones I had the matching one to with his name. Yea... Still tried to convince me it was old pictures.

Went home, cut a bunch of holes in the sweat shit he gave me, cut up the dog tags, not easy by the way, and gave them to him the next day.


This story does have a funny ending though.

I'm now married to and expecting my first child with my male(different) best friend that my ex was always suspicious of and worried about lol.

He got back with the crazy ex, she poked holes in their condoms, told him it was her and the baby or the army, so instead of having a good position in the army and following his dream he now works as a driver and they have I believe 3/4 kids. Feel bad for the guy but he was a jerk in the end."
3242,Telling me I‚Äôm unreasonable and acting crazy for questioning him about the fact that he wanted to be in a relationship with me one day then the next day saying I‚Äôm not ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù material L M A O
3243,"I found pictures of him and his ex in his car and when I questioned him about it, he said that they had been there forever and he didn‚Äôt know. However, I had borrowed his car and had placed my phone in the same place he claimed they had always been. I knew he was lying but I let it go (I know, stupid). He straight up said, you‚Äôre being crazy, it‚Äôs all in your head. Anyway, I ended up using his iPad and when he was in the shower saw his messages. Sure enough, he was messaging his ex and she didn‚Äôt know about me. One message said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget the pictures, I want to see them‚Äù (from her) on a day he said he was working late, ‚ÄúI love you. I‚Äôm gonna marry you one day.‚Äù (From him) the day I questioned him about the pictures."
3244,"He tried to tell me that since I said I'd 'try' to make things work, he thought he's absolved of everything. And it was my fault for making it seem like everything was okay. 

This was two days after he left me crying in the middle of a market."
3245,"My ex told me I was imagining things when I told him that I felt like I his ex-gf-but-still-best-friend was taking a more active role in his life than I would‚Äôve liked, and that I didn‚Äôt feel like I was his GF, that the partnership needed in relationships was with her. 

He got angry, told me I was jealous and insecure, and that it ‚Äúwas a story I told myself in my head‚Äù.

In the next two weeks the ex-gf-but-still-best-friend dropped casually in conversation that he and she were looking to buy a house together as an investment and he skipped my 30th birthday to go to a festival with her. 

We were together for 5 years at this point."
3246,"Whenever I panic about bugs I'm told I'm being dramatic. Or when I point out hypocrisy on double standards about some males being quiet but not receiving backlash or complaints about it, and some males (besides females) finding it strange. 

Most of all though anytime I make a facial expression some people tell me I'm being too sensitive, etc. And if I get upset then I'm told I'm being crazy. If I usually reach the point that I'm told this, it doesnt stop me from going off on people and pointing out their flaws at that point. Its the only time they actually all of a sudden want to keep quiet about their business."
3247,When they are actually doing you dirty behind your back and wonder why you have jealousy/anxiety issues then get mad when you find out and gaslight you
3248,"Ahhh.. good old Gaslighting.  I never knew it was a thing. I also never knew that covert narcs existed to suck the life out of their hosts.  Here are some key phrases I now know are Gaslighting manipulation tactics:

‚Äú That doesn‚Äôt resonate with me.‚Äù Used when the host is describing an actual event where the parasite was being abusive. Used in a group setting mainly. Sometimes used in a private conversation.  This is an attempt to reframe an actual historical narrative of the relationship.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that.‚Äù Used by the abuser to toss word salad into a discussion to throw the host off-balance and make the host confused enough to shut-the-fuck-up because the host is revealing truths about the parasite.

‚ÄúYou(host) said/did: xyz phrase or action.‚Äù  Straight up lie by the parasite to blatantly control the host narrative about something the host said or did.

These are the top 3 that were consistently used on me.  There are more. Please post.  If you were a host to a parasite, please know that you may or may not have codependent tendencies. That is something to dive into with a therapist.  Most hosts are simply people who trust and love very deeply, and for whatever reason became the targets of emotionally abusive parasites.  The covert parasite is the worst because they will MIRROR their target host/s in order to pass as a normal human. They are not normal. They are a soulless black holes. The hosts are only there to feed their exhaustive need of self-worth and to be used as extensions of the parasite self."
3249,"I saw photos and videos of a guy with escorts, on a boys trip without his girlfriend. I had literally seen the footage.

I suggested that I saw these videos, can‚Äôt make that shit up.

He told me ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see anything‚Äù and some other stuff, trying to brainwash me into thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me. Pathetic."
3250,"Me expressing ""discomfort"" (nothing more) at him hanging out alone with his ex, who he got back together with almost immediately after we broke up."
3251,"My ex would promise things, not do them and call me an entitled bitch when I confronted him on it. Because he would make the promise and in his head ‚Äútell me he was unhappy and wouldn‚Äôt fulfill it‚Äù and I was supposed to read his mind. 

Life is so much saner now. And they say women are the crazy ones who want you to read their minds....."
3252,"I had a problem with my ex drinking alcohol behind my back (this is after a long term problem with his alcoholism). I noticed that when I was at work he was drinking alcohol because I would come home and see the empty bottles in the trash. When I confronted him about this he emphatically denied it several times and when I got angry he turned around and acted like I was playing games and manipulating him! I ended the relationship that night, I can‚Äôt stand liars and people who can‚Äôt be accountable for their actions."
3253,"My ex was two timing me during our entire relationship, I was sadly the side chick. He would tell me repeatedly that the other girl (Main chick) was just a friend and she was emotionally unstable. We were in a long distance relationship. Year later, the truth came out and I alerted the other woman as well.

&#x200B;

He confronted me later on...proceeded to say that he never was in love with me and he loved the lady friend. Also said I was crazy and suffered from bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (there is a family history of members suffering from them). It was a low blow and for a moment I had questioned by sanity. 10 minutes into him yelling over the phone, I cussed him out.

During the course of our ""relationship"" my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and I had  untreated anxiety & depression, he said he stuck around only because he felt pity for me and wanted to leave long back.

Nevertheless he and the main chick are married now) and I have a loving boyfriend now. Still need to see a therapist though.

&#x200B;

Ladies, a man will only call you crazy when you have uncovered shit about them."
3254,My boss when I recently told him that treating elderly and immune compromised patients in our physiotherapy clinic during the COVID crisis could kill our patients and we need to stop.
3255,"i think everyone has an ex like that.

mine probably wasn't that bad of a person, just really immature. whenever i'd tell him ANYTHING that ruined the image of a perfect boyfriend he made of himself in his head he'd begin his manipulative ways of making me feel like a horrible and ungrateful person. my main feeling in that relationship was guilt and fear. and when i broke up with him he had the AUDACITY to tell me that that day he wanted to be honest for once and proceeded to stalk me for the next four hours."
3256,"My ex roommate would lie all of the time. Even on minor stuff. I would ask if he washed something, he‚Äôd say yes, and when I look in the sink it‚Äôs sitting there. I‚Äôd tell him something and later he would say I never told that to him, and put different words it‚Äô to the conversation instead. It just kept building and reached a breaking point where fundamentally I knew I was right, but to have someone every day tell you you never actually said/asked something? And to lie about things? It breaks you down."
3257,"When I expressed anger and frustration and I got called ""hysterical"". Or when I know, KNOW, he said/did something and he still tries to tell me that's not true. I don't fall for that, luckily."
3258,My ex would act like the giant red flags I was seeing were completely normal. If I bought up something he'd  act like it was ridiculous I was concerned.
3259,My ex told me he had met his neighbor and had been and will continue to hang out with her. I asked him if she knew he had a gf and he said that it wasn‚Äôt necessary to discuss his personal life with her........ and when I told him that that didn‚Äôt feel good he told me I was being too emotional and irrational about things.
3260,"My friend caught my ex bf at the bar with his ex while we were together. He knew I would not be okay with this and had lied about where he was going and who he‚Äôd be with. She obviously calls me and spills the beans so I freak out on him the next day.

You know what he says to me!? He tells me I should be more mad at my friend for calling me and ‚Äúruining my night‚Äù by making me upset and cry.  Then goes on a rant about how she is the really the bad guy here for starting drama and kept trying to bait me into agreeing with me. EXCUSE ME!? I was stunned into silence. 

The sad part is, it took me almost an entire year after that to leave him."
3261,"I worked in a job where I was bullied to the extreme with a splash of sexual harassment for good measure. I handed in my notice and said I was sick of the bullying.

The owner of the place screamed at me telling me ""if you cant handle some good natured banter, its your own fault for being stupid""

Yea OK my guy. I took that opportunity to tell him his son and manager had a threesome with my sister and joked about it with every other member of staff there. The manager tried to deny it even though she was the one who told me about it, told her to shut the fuck up.

So glad I left that job"
3262,"We were in the middle of a conversation about who knows what, and I had responded to a statement he'd made. He then stops and asks what I'm talking about, and that we were not having a conversation at all - that I was talking out loud to myself. Confused, I laugh it off, and tell him to stop messing around with me. I was positive I wasn't just *imagining* our entire conversation, but his straight face and concern eventually breaks me down after a solid 15-30 minutes fighting it. I'm in tears, my head is spinning, and I'm seriously concerned for my mental health. I thought I was legit going insane and it **terrified** me.

And then he started laughing.

I wasnt going insane. He was just an asshole. I wish I could have seen then that that was just the beginning. Pretty sure he was testing how pliable I was."
3263,"""You promised you'd call at 7."" - ""So?"" - ""It's not okay that you constantly break promises."" - ""Are you okay? You sound so unstable right now. Did you cut yourself?"" -> that's how he responded every single time I pointed something out.

Also, there was this time when HE coerced me into leaving boarding school for a day (holiday but the day after I would've had to go to school again) and then simply didn't show up at the train station to pick me up for five hours. It was in the middle of winter, there weren't even any caf√©s or stuff around where I could have gone to stay warm, I couldn't call anyone else to pick me up bc noone was in that town and the whole thing overall was bullshit. 

He showed up at 12:30 a.m. and without missing a beat shamed me for ""not staying warm"" and for ""not taking care of myself"". I had called him a bazillion goddamn times. When I said something along the lines of ""You promised you'd pick me up, how the hell was I supposed to stay warm? YOU screwed up here."" he threatened to leave me at the side of the road then and there - in the middle of the night, in winter... - The next day he refused to take me to the train station so I couldn't get back to boarding school and missed one day at school. Instead I was stuck on his couch while he browsed the internet. He didn't let me use the tv because it's his, he complained when I took out a book, he refused to cook but he also didn't let me go to the kitchen. ""Women are not allowed in there. It's a rule."" He refused to let me order pizza bc ""it's a waste of money"". I didn't eat until Sunday and I only stayed hydrated bc I'd sneak to the bathroom to get some water. Whenever I brought up needing something to eat he just said ""you are so demanding all the time"" and ""Can't I have a minute of peace?"" and ""I didn't force you to come here.""

Yes, I dumped him very soon after that and the whole thing only lasted about 5 months (probably less, it's a bit fuzzy), but still. 

He also constantly claimed I had ""moodswings"" because when I'd be in an okay (within the circumstances) mood that would quickly change when he once again went into a monologue about how worthless I am and how noone can even stand to be around me and how he ""doesn't even know why he puts up with me"" and so on and so forth. Newsflash, asshole: It's not moodswings if YOU MAKE IT HAPPEN.

I wish teen me had known better. But at least I know better now.

Worst part: He was over 30. I was 16."
3264,Literally any fight with my ex. He twisted words to make himself out to be the victim and making me doubt myself. It really wears you down over time.
3265,"Some guy I went to college with saw me on a dating app (we never matched) and added me on Instagram. He consistently messaged me for 2 years and I finally answered one day, then I realized we had a lot in common and we met in person and hit it off. We were speaking everyday for 2 months, hanging out all the time, and he wanted to be sexual so I said I would only be comfortable with it if we were on the same page that we were dating each other. He agreed so we started having a sexual relationship. I was under the impression we were dating but I noticed everyday he would be following at least 10 new girls on his instagram. 


I called him out on it and he lied to me saying they followed him first and then I realized he was finding them from the same app he saw me on. I asked him why he‚Äôs on a dating app still if we‚Äôre dating and he proceeds to act like I‚Äôm insane for thinking we were dating. I was also acting like a therapist for him too because he had a lot of mental health issues and he has the nerve to tell me I forced him into a relationship with me while knowing he wasn‚Äôt mentally okay enough to have one right now. I told this guy off for using me for sex and free emotional therapy and blocked his ass so fast."
3266,"I had an ex that would gaslight like a pro. He started spending time with this girl with a unisex name when I started picking up more shifts to move out from my abusive family. He stopped talking to me, inviting me out, or anything that constitutes a relationship. He then went on a week long trip with her and a few others, but shared a room with only her. I ask about the trip as it's happening. It was my only week off that summer and I find my boyfriend (via her snaps) alone in another city with her. He goes ballistic that I was 'stalking' him and harassing her. He insisted nothing happened, and I caved. During makeup sex, he MOANS HER NAME. Then insists I'm crazy, that he's been playing too many games with his guy friend of the same name, or that I misheard. I put my clothes on, left, and broke up by text (better than he deserved)."
3267,"My (ex)bf was hanging out with his friend from high school and she was going to be in town and staying at a hotel.  He said they were just friends and he was helping her through a break up.  I went out to meet with our mutual friends at a club and she was there.  I introduced myself and she was drunk and high.  She liked me right away and said he was helping her get through the break up and they almost fucked but he was too high.  He told her he cared for her and was trying to get her to give him money.  Once I found out, I approached him, told him, he's a womanizing manipulative asshole (I didn't yell or cry) and left.  

I went straight home, packed up his stuff and put it outside.  I told him to have our mutual friend pick it up and he did within 2 days.  I told our mutual friends we broke up and I didn't text or contact him.  After that he moved in with ANOTHER girl right away.  He changed his numbers and we didn't follow each other on social media.  He would constantly call me in the middle of the night from a blocked number (over 15 times/night) and he broke in my house two times (leaving ""love"" notes).  I filed police reports stating that and stayed at my best friend's house because I feared for my safety.  He told his new gf that he dumped her for me and that I was obsessed with him.  He also told our mutual friends and turned some of them against me.  

The people who saw through him knew what was going on and didn't take sides.  Years later, the ""friends"" that took his side (I wasn't even asking anyone to take sides) are trying to be friends with me again.  My ex was a total charming, handsome, and intelligent sociopath.  Literally everyone would look at him if he walked in a room.  He has that magnetism.  The last I heard he is a junkie now."
3268,I've been gaslighted by someone I had a crush on several years back. I think that would make up for a classic example of someone trying to make it seem as if you've gone bonkers when you actually haven't. I can look back and laugh at it now. What doesn't kill you does make you stronger.
3269,"My ex spread the word that I'm crazy and have borderline personality disorder to our mutual friend group that I've now been excluded by. This was because I left him and started seeing someone else, and he got to know about it. He even contacted the guy I was seeing and subjected him to verbal abuse.

The sad part is that I believed him for a while and really thought it was all my fault, and that his armchair diagnosis was true."
3270,"My now very recent ex, said that the reason he gave another woman his number (when i confronted him) was because I made peoples skin crawl and was bad at making friends so he gave it to her with the intention of me making a friend - yet he lied to my my face, saying he had no idea what her intentions were and that he would not give her his number when we initially discussed it, meanwhile he already did.

In every fight he used my bipolar diagnosis against me, saying that i am way too sensitive, I need help, i need meds, i am crazy, psychopathic, a lunatic... all because i tried to explain why I was getting upset when he checked out other women EVERY SINGLE TIME we stepped out our front door, when he did not help me out around the house, never helped me cook dinner, or even used his own initiative to make dinner - when he would play games and watch Facebook videos all night from the minute he got home to the minute his eyes shut to sleep. 

It was always my fault, i was always wrong. I was delusional, crazy and the one with all the communication issues. I needed a strait jacket. 

If I wanted anything, i needed to ask. I needed to ask for his time, ask for him to clean and I had to respect the fact that he ""observed"" people and was not checking out women. Try sitting at lunch with someone who is so busy staring at every other woman to actually have a conversation with you.

Fun times."
3271,"Any male friend I text is my ""boyfriend"". He also accuses me of sending them inappropriate pictures and videos. He's accused me of cheating throughout our whole 15 year marriage. 

He even gets jealous when my female friends text me and will get mad if I say something he finds offensive. 

It's been a long, hard marriage. I've put up with emotional and verbal abuse the entire time. He finally agreed to counseling after I requested a divorce. I stayed through it and we've been doing wonderful until now. I'm done unless he changes."
3272,"Haha! I experienced this a lot over the course of a decade-long relationship, but this was the highlight. 

Ex decided - after meeting her for the first time - that he was in love with my best friend. There followed a week of him telling me how amazing she was was, how he'd never felt this way before, etc. I ended up telling best friend about this, who rejected him by text in the strongest possible terms. Ex was deeply offended and complained that she could have been nicer about it so his feelings didn't get hurt (?!)

A few weeks later, he begged me to get him a temp role in my office as he was out of work and wanted something to put on his CV. Problem was, I worked with my best friend so this would obviously involve all kinds of awkwardness. Despite that, I talked to her and (with much trepidation) she agreed to it - several years later, I still feel horrible for putting her in that position, and have apologised profusely for it many times.

So I spoke to my boss and secured a temp position for my ex. Ex said he was gonna take it, then he didn't. Then he was gonna take it again, and then he didn't. This went on an on for a whole summer, with my best friend tensely awaiting ex's arrival in the office and my boss constantly quizzing me about when ex was gonna turn up because the role was waiting for him. 

In the end I told ex that the role was no longer on the table. He refused to talk to me for days, and when he finally did, he accused me of being completely unreasonable about the whole thing and treating him unfairly. 

I finally broke up with him shortly after."
3273,"My ex used to express a thought, feeling, desire or opinion of sorts, when I would bring it up later on he would be a total 180¬∞ on it, and the very notion that I would say something like that would confuse him.

In his defense, he didn't have an amazing memory but it made me question myself constantly. Years later, I still can't tell what was real and what wasn't - did I really make it up? Does he remember this or that? Did he actually love me?

Also, my family gaslights me constantly. Fun times."
3274,"I had an ex who I was seeing and we had plans one night to hang out. He was saying he was leaving work and so I drove over to his place and he literally stopped replying but I saw he was home. I called him nearly 20 times I bet because he was home and we had just texted about seeing each other. I thought maybe he fell asleep so his phone vibrating would wake him up, I had already taken the time to come over. After no answer for 20 mins or so I left. BUT I SWEAR WE HAD PLANS.

The next morning he called me telling me he did fall asleep, and that I was crazy for calling him. When I said it was because we had plans and he wasted my time otherwise so I tried to wake him up, he said in this smug voice ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know...... seems crazy to me.....‚Äù like he knew what he was doing. I was calmly explaining too. He made me feel insane all the time, would lie to my face and then completely deny what he said. Thankful I‚Äôm out of that."
3275,"My ex would say I was having a manic episode anytime I spoke about something that was bothering me. For example, me finding out he had been cheating on me with 8 different girls."
3276,"Among many things, this one stands out to me immediately. His sister would always have parties at her house. She befriended this girl via her best friend, Brandon. Anyway, this girl would get invited to her parties, etc. My now ex, would amateur-ly DJ for fun. This girl took an interest every time. She‚Äôd just hang with him while he was doing it watching him and what not. I got weird vibes from it, just because she never tried to talk to me or befriend me but was very interested in my ex. I‚Äôd even leave the party to go home and he‚Äôd just... stay for hours. 

I addressed my feelings and concerns to my ex that I think she likes him and he makes it out like I‚Äôm crazy and just dismissed it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just jealous‚Äù üòê

Well a month after him and I broke up, he and her are suddenly in a relationship. Haha which lasted under a few months. But still! I knew something weird was happening and he makes it out like I‚Äôm fucking crazy."
3277,"I was sitting next to my husband on the couch and no hand on my knee or arm around me or any physical contact but when I get up the dog jumps up there and he‚Äôs petting him, giving him kisses, etc.  I ask him why is it he can show the dog affection but not me and he says I‚Äôm really sick for being jealous of the dog. Yeah? Well fuck you. Next time you want some go fuck the dog"
3278,"Not me but my mom.
Light bulb in aquarium broke somehow. My mom knew exactly what to do, it had problem with wire inside switch but nooo my father knows better of course. She was trying to tell him and then repair it but my dad just screamed that she can't know better. It all started at 5pm and my mom started repairing it at 6.30 because earlier dad wouldn't let her. He only allowed her, when he got overly mad.

It's not the first time the same situation happened. My dad actually sucks at repairing and even more at electrical stuff. My mom is very good at it but nooo dad must always screw everything first so my mom can fix it and not be at all acknowledged.
Dad can't even measure where to install hooks on wall for curtains hoooow does he worked at construction work no fucking idea - _-"
3279,"My ex-husband said I had terrible taste in movies and television (horror movies, Friends, Buffy), and told me that he cut down on our cable to keep me from wasting so much time watching TV. Then he bragged in front of a group of our friends one night that he had actually just put the parental controls on the TV to keep me from listening to MTV in the mornings as I got ready. (This was seventeen years ago.) I was so embarrassed, but I didn‚Äôt realize until none of our friends laughed or chimed in how fucked up that was. Y‚Äôall, I swear that the TV was on for about an hour most weekday mornings, and I watched horror movies on Saturday mornings before anyone else got up, but he made me sound like a brain dead zombie."
3280,Ex went to visit Mexico from the US and got a girlfriend there. He then came back and told me that I had no right to be upset because it‚Äôs not cheating when the girl is in a different country. Then he convinced his friends to badger me and call me crazy because what I was doing wasn‚Äôt right... hence the ex. He later stalked me and messaged all my friends on Facebook to find my location because a ‚Äúwitch‚Äù told him I was his soulmate. So yeah I‚Äôd say I wasn‚Äôt the crazy one here.
3281,The ones who try to mansplain that hormones don‚Äôt really make you act differently during your period.
3282,"My step dad this past Christmas told me to my face that ‚Äúthere was something wrong with me‚Äù and I was ‚Äútoo angry.‚Äù He felt the need to fully confront me about it at dinner one day. He felt that way because that morning id been having a fight with my sister he was not involved in in any way. Literally we had the fight in the next room over, and I walked out into the kitchen to cool off. I‚Äôm pretty sure he told me to be quiet or something, when I literally hadn‚Äôt said a word since I‚Äôd entered the kitchen. I was pretty heated in the moment and told him to fuck off. To me, that seems like a much more mild thing to say to someone than I think it seemed to him. My sister and I made up later‚Äîit was just some dumb fight about me borrowing her razor, I apologized, she accepted and apologized for some stuff she said, all good‚Äîbut I refused to apologize to my step dad or even engage with him when he tried to confront me about it.

What struck me as like really weird though was he had not seen me or spoken to me for a full year. He literally knows nothing about me. And yet, he approached this conversation like it was some kind of intervention. Like I was headed down some horrible life path and was this deeply flawed person. Like doubtless I overreacted by letting my sister rile me up and I shouldn‚Äôt have, and I should have had the decency to respect her enough to ask before I borrowed something of her‚Äôs in the first place, but literally the night before his wife, my mother, had yelled at him and thrown shit around for about three hours. That‚Äôs...honestly pretty run of the mill for her as well. We were all together for about six days over Christmas and my mom had fully screamed at every single one of us before it was over. I definitely get my temper from her, but I try to be aware of my shortcomings and I admit it when I make a mistake (for example, I was apologizing for borrowing my sister‚Äôs stuff from the get-go: we got into a fight because she called me gross and it really upset me, and I lashed out). My mom has never apologized in her life. It‚Äôs like she has these violent episodes in a fugue state and then expects you not to remember them. It kind of felt like he knew he was powerless to confront my mom about it so he was channeling that onto me. Like it was so outlandish of him to even try that to the extent my sister defended me‚Äîeven after I was frank with my step dad and told him I wasn‚Äôt going to participate in that conversation with him‚Äîand insisted that wasn‚Äôt true, and that having one fight didn‚Äôt make me ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù.

And frankly I am not sorry for telling him to fuck off. I meant it. I wish I‚Äôd said it to him when I was in highschool about a million times. He‚Äôs been nothing but rude to me if not cruel since I was 14, no matter how much I tried to avoid him. He spent my entire highschool career trying to convince my mom I was so awful and on drugs and sleeping around. I‚Äôm 26, still a massive virgin, weed gives me seizures, and all my friends are still nerdy board game fanatics. We went to bonaroo together and collectively had literally one beer. We were complete losers and I was honestly very happy that way. I always have been. Like, I‚Äôm not a saint but I‚Äôve never been the person he made me out to be. I think he did that to try to get my mom to stop giving me any money or supporting me so he could have it for various expensive farm projects he was invested in on a piece of land my mother bought him. He confronted me multiple times when I was in highschool about spending too much money. I was lucky if I ever had $2 in my pocket and constantly had to beg lunch money off my mom or depend on the charity of the lunch ladies if my mom forgot to pay it or refused, but sure. I‚Äôm positive it‚Äôs me asking for new shoes bc my last pair have a hole in them and not him trying to buy a 15k piece of farm equipment thats the imbalance in the checkbooks. To be clear, he has not been employed full time since he married my mother. I was forced to get part time gigs to support myself.

I think it‚Äôs really sad honestly because my mom was already a super paranoid and angry person, and I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs exacerbated that or just been a victim of it. There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that they justify each other‚Äôs worse behavior, because I experienced the way they prop up each other‚Äôs completely false realities first hand. But I kind of worry that maybe I lost what little relationship I could have had with my mother due to him always trying to turn me into this horrid person. I kind of doubt it though. The abuse definitely got worse after they married, but not until my mom came into a significant amount of money, and I think the money was what really caused her to become unhinged. It was all kind of downhill from there. Now that I don‚Äôt talk to or see either of them, except for at holidays, I guess they get to turn me into whatever they need me to be to make sense of their lives. I don‚Äôt answer my mom‚Äôs calls anymore for my own mental health and I‚Äôm completely financially independent except for my phone plan because she is unwilling to relinquish my phone number to me. I wouldn‚Äôt even see her or him at holidays if other members of my family I do want to see didn‚Äôt feel that they should be there for it to be a complete family gathering.

Sorry I know this got kind of ramble-y. I hope it‚Äôs ok if I still post it. Writing this all out kind of made me realize some things.

TL:DR; my step dad called me crazy for telling him to fuck off. If I ever see him again it‚Äôll be too soon."
3283,"He kept telling me he loved me, then kept saying he was just drunk."
3284,"When my first boyfriend flew off the handle one time for enforcing a boundary with my friends when I felt I had been slighted. He turned around and acted shocked when I told him the situation, told me he was disappointed with me, that I ""wasn't acting like myself"", started a fight and threw out my antidepressants. Glad to be rid of him."
3285,"My daughters father. He stole over 3000 dollars from me, he slept with everyone around the sun. One of the women actually called me crying that he was cheating on her. Im like why the fuck are you calling me and how did you get my number, and shes like I knew about you. She was the crazy one. He was in a different state due to his job. He would beat the shit out of me. He then told everyone I was lying and of course people believed him because they said he would never do something like that. He told people not to believe me because I was a whack job. This was over 8 years ago and people still dont look at me the same. They have no clue."
3286,When my husband told me that it was just my anxiety when I made the decision to self isolate us at the beginning of March. Turns out I was right.
3287,"My ex confessed to me that he never deleted any dating apps after we had gotten together because I was at work 40 hours a week and couldn‚Äôt give him the attention he needed throughout the day. He didn‚Äôt have a full time job, he did face painting and balloon animals as a side gig and lives at home with his parents. I shit you not. He claimed that he‚Äôd need at least 2 or 3 other girlfriends to fill his time. He knew I was the monogamous type going in. I was understandably hurt by this and communicated this with him. He later asked if we could forget about the whole thing and go back to where we were before. I said no. He came back with ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we just get married?‚Äù. No again buddy!! He returned with, ‚Äúthis is why I can‚Äôt be honest with you, you always freak out! Don‚Äôt you see how that‚Äôs a problem? I can‚Äôt ever tell you the truth because of how you respond.‚Äù

Aaaaand so I dumped him."
3288,"my bf constantly stares at other women when we're out together in public. when I would bring it up, he'd deny it all and say that he had only been looking at me this whole time. it happened so many times, and he'd always make me feel like a crazy gf. recently, however, he finally admitted most of it."
3289,"I once play ""slapped"" a guy who was in my ex's social circle. I use the quotation marks because it was very slow and very soft - it was basically a caress in the context of a slap. I was very deliberate about the motion because I was slightly drunk and didn't want to accidentally use more force than I meant to.

My ex started losing his shit and properly hit me in the face. I got pissed off, yelled at him and left.

He forever maintained that he'd done me a favour because if he hadn't slapped me the others would have resented me for essentially using a pussy pass to get away with ""hitting"" a guy."
3290,Would straight up call me spaz and psychotic. Said my suspicion was unfounded....  found him on a dating website lol
3291,"My ex boyfriend ‚Äúfound‚Äù the condom in my bathroom trash that we had just used like 15 minutes before and came out of the bathroom with it. He was screaming, accusing me of cheating and kept completely denying we had sex that day at all. He just kept asking me who I‚Äôm cheating with and calling me all the names in the book.

This guy also wouldn‚Äôt let me sleep with out being in a phone call with him all night and if the call dropped he would accuse me of cheating and  spam call me untill I woke up."
3292,"I worked in retail and I had this coworker who coudnt admit his mistakes. We had another sale on already reduced items. The items were 30 % off the original price and they gave another 20 %. He typed in a total of 50% off the original price. This was of course wrong. (100 Euros original price for a shirt reduced 30%- 70 Euros. Then 70 Euros  and 20% off- You pay 56 Euros.) This guy insisted I coudnt do math. He said I was crazy for getting it wrong. Later the boss came and asked who typed it wrong. He pointed at me and said I was too dumb to work at the register. Boss listened to the story, put me on the register and him to organize the clothes. He insisted until I quit I was too dumb for math and loudly told everyone. So I became the ""cant do basic calculations"" lady that somehow still worked at the register. Crazy right?"
3293,"We lived in different states and decided to meet somewhere halfway. He parked his car in a public garage and we used my car to get around town. He wanted to go to a museum there but he never told me that part. Just told me he had something planned. We get there and the museum is closed. Great. So we had no idea what to do for the rest of the day. We stop to get a drink and he keeps telling me we should go to Haverhill (which was kind of a hike from where we were) because his friend Matt worked at a bar there. Kept bringing it up, let's go to Haverhill, let's go to Haverhill. I didn't want to go but I finally gave in. He gets all upset and says "" you only want to go to Haverhill because you want to see Matt, you just like him more than you like me!"" I'm like ok, this was your idea... Finally decided that wasn't happening and we should just end the day there. When I was driving him to pick his car back up so we could go our separate ways, he jumps out of the car at a red light and walks away. He was not that far from the parking garage so I just let him go and I started driving home. He was an odd duck so it wasn't that out of character for him to do something spontaneous like that. About ten minutes later I get a text from him saying ""what is wrong with you?"" Acting like I'm the crazy one. Yeah, ok buddy. That was one of the last times I saw him."
3294,"This isn‚Äôt nearly as bad as other‚Äôs, but my anxiety is triggered when my stuff is out of place because a lot of my life, I depend on muscle memory for things and my mind blanks if I reach other to a place and what I need isn‚Äôt there.  I have dyslexia and I rely on the color and location of the apps on my phone rather than the name or logo of the app.  One day, my boyfriend at the time had gotten ahold of my phone and was playing keep away while in class and I was just bored of it so I stopped trying to grab it.  He moved every single app on my phone.  Once I saw, I began to panic and I began to sort them back into place.  He kept trying to laugh it off and talk to me.  I told him I can‚Äôt talk until everything is back in place.  He called me crazy.  Said it not a big deal and I can do it later.  He never understood anxiety or depression since he was homeschooled and never had experienced it or witnessed it before.  Years later he apologized."
3295,"He gaslit me for a long time. 

He'd hide my things, let me go crazy looking for them. Then I'd come back and find it next to him."
3296,"This is a slightly different issue, but my husband was a wrestler back in college and had many concussions when he was younger. He doesn‚Äôt have a very good short term memory anymore. Sometimes I‚Äôll say something (and he‚Äôll be fully engaged in the conversation) and then he won‚Äôt remember it an hour later. Sometimes I‚Äôll mention something that happened and he‚Äôll have no memory of it. I used to think I was going crazy, but not so much anymore now that we figured out what probably caused it. Poor guy looks so sad when I mention something he can‚Äôt remember. 

I hope he doesn‚Äôt lose memories of our kids as they grow up."
3297,"My ex used to belittle me and talk down to me all the time.  Would laugh when I struggled in school, would tell me I was wrong all the time blah blah.Treated me like I could never be as smart as he was , and then when I got into a really high ranking private college in our state & he got rejected from all 3 of his top choices , he broke up with me after not talking to me for days.
& told me that I was trying to make him feel dumb... when I was just happy about being successful for once."
3298,"from like 15-19 years old my ex (19-23m) was literally a serial cheater. i let it go because the first time i tried to leave he ingested like 30 pills and i had to take him to the ER (my 17th birthday). well when i was 19 he asked me to drive him to his cousins, but it was really his mistresses house. i saw her outside & confronted him about it being a females house when he said he was going to be at his cousin vyntrells house and he called me crazy. he told me to stop being insecure and that he was no longer cheating and if it was an issue we didnt have to be together. i felt very guilty and apologized.. 1 month later i find out hes been sending her money and they have their own relationship. i left and to this day he thinks it wasnt a big deal"
3299,"I dated a man who had me convinced I didn't ""know how to love"" or ""know how to communicate"" 

Ironically, HE had no one in his life except me, and I was/am still surrounded by folks who love and accept me and would do anything for me, proving that I DO know how to love and communicate. 

By the way, I now have a wonderful man who loves me for me and thinks all the others are CRAZY for letting me go. :)"
3300,"When I was married to my ex husband I was in a really bad state of mind, for reference I had a past relationship end because my boyfriend committed suicide, Rene. My ex husband new this.

Due to this I was and am adamantly against suicide and have never attempted myself, but I was in a place where I was seriously considering this. So I went to my husband and was trying to talk to him about it and I said ""it just feels like Rene is haunting me."" which from prior conversations meant that I was headed down a dark path.  


My ex looked at me, rolled his eyes and said ""you're just unhappy so you're just trying to cause drama."" and then  promptly went back to his video game.  


I soon found out that he was on girlfriend #4 in the course of our relationship/marriage...yeah left after that. No so much making me feel crazy, but it was so dismissive that it did make me second guess myself, and due to this and other instances like it I ended up doing some serious counseling when that marriage ended."
3301,"My ex wasn‚Äôt able to see me for two months and spent the entire two months on the phone and playing video games with his ex girlfriend. When I confronted him after I was able to see him again, he said it wasn‚Äôt his fault, he was depressed and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôd fallen for her, but he still wanted to be with me I just had to give him space to deal with this issue and he definitely would still continue to hang out with her even though he‚Äôd confessed his love for her and I was a crazy bitch for wanting him to stop talking to the ex girlfriend he was in love with. And I stayed for another 2 years..."
3302,One of my exes swore up and down that he was only rooming with his ex gf because it was tough times. I was skeptical and eventually I believed him like a fool. Fast forward and he kept making excuses at to why he had not moved out and why she had not move out either. I kept asking and crying and he kept saying I was overreacting and would give me the cold shoulder. Regretfully it took me longer than I had wish to finally admit that I was dumb for believing that. I really wanted to believe his kindness and ‚Äòhonest‚Äô way were genuine.  He is still with her last I heard.
3303,"Ooooof.

Context: I'm 7 years younger, and our relationship has been strained and scary with many abusive events I tried to excuse. We're on month 9 during this event.

Invited me out downtown to see him when he was with his (also toxic and awful) group of friends. I walk up to him to say hi and he freaks out in front of all of his friends saying that I'm stalking him and he didn't invite me there. Then later outside he says he was kidding and we proceed to be goofing around, he gets a cigarette out and I took it out of his mouth bc I was going to smoke it instead (we did this often to eachother). Right as this happens, his friends come outside, and he goes, ""Did you see that??? She just hit me! She knocked my cigarette right out of my mouth!"" and then acted ""scared"" of me... literally cowered in my presence? His friends completely bought it and kicked me out of the bar.

A special kind of crazy, I tell you.

Yes I still dated him after that. I was the dumbest 22 year old in the world"
3304,"A dated a guy I work with and he got too much shit from people that he was dating me (it‚Äôs because I work in Human Resources and he‚Äôs in a Union) and he got tired of it so he ghosted me and told all his coworkers that I chased after him and I was in love with him and I wanted to move in with him after the first date. 

He still texts me to try to check up on me.."
3305,"""this was never a relationship, I never wanted a relationship, I don't know why you thought I did, I told you I was only after friends with benefits""

Still had ""interested in a relationship"" on his dating profile, apparently only brought me flowers on Valentine's and wanted to spend the day with me because sometimes his sister got sad if she didn't get flowers on Valentine's, only told me he wanted to meet his grandparents (after saying ""because you're important to me and I want them to know how special you are"") because he supposedly felt sorry for me not knowing my own grandparents.

Etc etc etc. Lies upon lies."
3306,"My fiance hit me for years and made me believe it was my fault and that he really loved me

This was years ago, I'm with an amazing person now"
3307,"When he went out one night. I had this gut feeling that he was cheating. I went overboard and sent him 600 messages begging him not to do it, not to ruin our relationship, that I was having extreme panic attacks and i was alone. He told me ‚Äúit‚Äôs my anxiety‚Äù and he‚Äôs going to bed and he loves me. 
The fucker was cheating on me that night. He confessed in the morning in the most casual way possible."
3308,"My ex told me it is my fault that he drove drunk home, cause I didn't let him sleep at my home, on single bad with me after a party. We were not a couple at the time anymore. I told him I will call an uber, but he refused. He was arguing with me at 2am and I had enough and just shut the door.
I called him after few minutes to check if he is ok. Found out he is at his home, took his car. He also told me few days later that I am lying cause he was not that drunk and he did not had problems with walking. Also I am a bad person cause now he knows he cannot count on me when in need of help. And his friends are on his side."
3309,"This literally happened yesterday. My father was in a crappy mood because of a customer interaction earlier that day and when he came back, he was very pissy with my mom and I during dinner. 

When my parents argue, I try to not say anything and just leave because I don‚Äôt like seeing it or being dragged into it. It‚Äôs uncomfortable seeing a couple fight in front of you. Well, I tried that and he indicated that I was crazy for doing that and that ‚Äúthey were not fighting.‚Äù And other bs."
3310,"My ex once tried to convince me I was a pathological liar, because I didn‚Äôt tell him about having a conversation with one of my male coworkers while I was working. Apparently, not mentioning that directly after it happen, was me lying. And when I mentioned that he lied to me regularly, he gaslighted the fuck out of me and tried to convince me I was lying so much I couldn‚Äôt keep them all straight. So glad to be out of that relationship."
3311,"I canceled a date on this guy because he kept saying creepy stuff like ""can't wait to hug you and hold your hand"". He called me a prude and that he ""wasn't even asking for a kiss"""
3312,"My current boyfriend gets upset with me that I have a problem with him using cam girls. Every time I try to bring it up and talk about it, it's my problem because I'm jealous and insecure. My actual problem is he just doesn't communicate with me about it and tried to deny it in front of me instead of admitting to it. Then I caught him doing it and he said he did it once, then a few hours later admitted twice, and then told me he'd done it a few times since telling me he'd stop (less than a week before). And then guilt me into saying he didn't get why I was upset and made me feel terrible because it was things wrong with me as to why I was upset, not that it was wrong that he was doing it.

He also tries to gaslight me into saying that I abandon him when he's having bad mental health times (drinking too much and throwing things, having full-on freakouts) when he's always here for me (I'm sober, currently attend therapy, and my bad mental health days do not present like this). So he says he can't ""open up to me"" because that's just now how it is for guys."
3313,"I had a stalker when I was 19 and he created a fake Yahoo accounts to pretend to be his cousin and friends trying to talk to me about how nice of a guy my stalker was. Then the guy ended up in the hospital, and my own MOM was one of the physicians who‚Äôd round where he was who said he actually had heart problems. I tried piecing it all together to see how he‚Äôd gotten to be near my mom, never figured it out. I ended up telling him to leave me alone but he‚Äôd drive to my college apartment and sit outside for a bit or call me from random numbers for a while. It was the weirdest fucking thing ever and I felt crazy through the entire ordeal."
3314,my ex called be a psycho bitch cause he was high with his friends and started texting me how he wanted to kill him self (he has severe depression) so i texted his friend that was with him to look out for him and make sure he was safe and then my ex started yelling at me saying he saw what i texted him saying that i was a psychotic manipulative bitch. soooooo...
3315,"Not romantic- my boss.

The TLDR: I got in trouble at work and my boss said some nasty things to me. Not derogatory or discriminatory but just kinda not nice. This was EOD Friday... he took me outside to yell at me. Obviously I was humiliated and felt like a child. 

Monday morning as soon as I come in, I‚Äôm told to come to boss‚Äôs office with our VP, where I am told I‚Äôm being ‚Äúwritten up‚Äù for ‚Äúinsolence‚Äù or whatever. I mention the conversation with my boss and include some particular words he‚Äôd used and he said ‚ÄúDelightfulcheer, I never said that. I need you to repeat after me, ‚ÄòBoss, you never said that.‚Äô‚Äù I STARED at our VP helplessly, saying ‚ÄúHe said that. Boss said those words. I‚Äôm not making this up‚Äù but VP didn‚Äôt do anything... just sat there quietly, didn‚Äôt stand up for me, and Boss said again, ‚ÄúDelightfulcheer, I need you to repeat after me: ‚ÄòBoss, you never said that.‚Äô‚Äù

It was patronizing, humiliating, to be gaslighted like that. Although things have been mostly smooth since, I honestly have never seen my boss - or our VP- the same. Once you try and gaslight me like that- forcing me to ‚Äúadmit‚Äù that something ‚Äúwas never said‚Äù when it WAS? You lose my respect.

To add to this: the next day I had to sign the ‚Äúwrite-up‚Äù, which was very clearly a template they‚Äôd pulled off a Google search, lol. The form said ‚ÄúEmployee did:‚Äù, ‚Äúemployee signature‚Äù etc... I‚Äôm actually not an employee, I‚Äôm a contractor (‚Äúperma-lancer‚Äù, which yes is a messed up concept but sadly common in our industry). I took a picture of the form to save it for my own records... to be honest I‚Äôm considering taking legal action against them at some point for the ‚Äútreat you like an employee, pay you like a contractor‚Äù thing (when I talked to VP about the form he said ‚Äúoh well we think of you like an employee‚Äù... cool, more reason for me to take action). 

I have applied for sooo many jobs since all this went on, but.... no luck. I‚Äôm in a niche, competitive industry and obviously right now the job market isn‚Äôt awesome."
3316,"Its so dumb.  I've told this story before, a lot, you've probably seen/read it before.

I caught him cheating in a video game.  We had two characters that we were supposed to be playing together, and he would constantly out level me, by a lot.  He tried to say it was because I was bad at the game.  I mean, I am the one who introduced him to the game, and I'd been playing for two years before he came along, and in that time the content had only been made easier...  but okay, sure.  

I let it slide because it honestly wasn't a big deal until I actually caught him on the character when he was supposed to be at work.  I was home sick and I was logged in at a time I wouldn't normally be. I came to where he was any watched him playing the character, and then I made myself known that I was there.   I could practically see the ""oh shit"" moment.  He immediately logged off.

I asked him about it and he denied it.  ""Someone must be logged in as me!"" he insisted.  Accounts get hacked all the time, so he changed his password, updated his virus protection, etc.  I even helped him with it (I work in IT).

A few days later, same thing.  This time I didn't say anything to him.  I just watched to see how long he would stay on.

Eventually he was outpacing me by multiple levels and saying it was because I was so bad at the game, so I confronted him about all the times he was logged on when he wasn't supposed to be. 

He insisted I was crazy, that I was imagining things, etc.  That I was so paranoid about not being good at something, so on and so forth.

I cut him out of my life -- and for my trouble, I was stalked for almost two years.  I found out eventually that he had a drug problem, didn't actually have a job, and the money he used to take me on dates/pay for the game/everything he was stealing from his mother.

I still get messages from him periodically on an email account I only for ""give us your email"" stuff that call me a crazy bitch.  This was 11 years ago.

Who's crazy?"
3317,"I have a history of drug use that's affected my short term memory. Sometimes i forget things, and sometimes I dont. My ex would use this to gaslight me all the time. My ex had a habit of teasing me for the things I love (movies, music, my clothes etc) and when I would get mad, he would say hes joking and I need to get over it. When he'd do it again and I'd remind him that i hate being talked to like that and I'd ask him to stop because hes done it before, he would say ""I dont remember saying that"" or ""maybe you're not remembering right"". But I know what he said because I'd be so upset about it. He would tell me that my anxiety is out of control and that I need to get over or and stop being so sensitive. 
One night after drinking, he tried telling me that my best friend wasnt really my friend and that no one would ever love me like he does. But of course, he doesnt remember saying that either. Well i definitely remembered that, and noped the fuck away from him."
3318,"TW: rape and sexual assault 

. 
. 
. 
. 
. 

My ex raped me many times throughout our two and a half year relationship. I don‚Äôt know when it started, as the first like six months of our relationship was loving and we were each other‚Äôs first partners in every sense. 

I just remember freezing when he‚Äôd do it, and sometimes crying while he would. He never stopped when I asked him to. Then he‚Äôd tell me later, ‚ÄúYou never said ‚Äòno.‚Äô That‚Äôs the magic word.‚Äù 

Spoiler alert: he still wouldn‚Äôt stop when I‚Äôd say no. 

So then he started telling people (after we broke up) ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not rape if it‚Äôs your girlfriend.‚Äù AND PEOPLE SIDED WITH HIM. Needless to say, none of those people are in my life anymore."
3319,I had a friend who is a world renowned artist and I deeply respected. We worked on projects together all the time & had a deep connection that was NEVER sexual. He tried hitting on me once and I turned him down bc I‚Äôm married & i chalked it up to him being drunk. it later turned out he had sex with my sister twice who is older than me & has a son and is in a relationship of over 12 years. He tried to tell me that I was crazy for being mad and not wanting to be friends anymore. My sister admitted it to me and I forced her to tell her partner. They (sister & her partner) decided to work things out. He told all my friends that my sister and I were both crazy and lumped me in with her & her shenanigans. I don‚Äôt personally like my sister at all and would never be friends with her. I hate that I get lumped into anything with her bc she‚Äôs in the same art scene I‚Äôm in with very few women in it. I‚Äôve completely back away from it bc of her actions.
3320,"The guy I had all my firsts with always called me crazy for thinking he was talking to other girls. If I looked on his Snapchat there were nudes, him flirting, etc..when confronted he said it was his friend tony who had a gf and a baby. So he used my guys phone to cheat on his girl. LIES LIES ALL LIES"
3321,"When I asked for a divorce from my ex-husband he contacted any of my friends and family who would listen to him and told them that ""I'm not well"" and tried to get the to ""talk some sense into me""."
3322,"My ex was an abusive gaslighter who liked to tell me all kinds of terrible things about myself, and when I rebutted him and asked where and why he formulated these opinions, he'd drop in the old nugget, ""I'm not the only one who thinks so"". He always tried to make me think my friends were talking about me - to him - behind my back, and they all agreed with him about what a (whatever suited the moment) I was. I knew better, thankfully."
3323,"The time my ex told me I was faking being nice in front of his family because I cleaned my plate after eating. 
He made me feel like I was crazy almost on the daily but I remember that one incident specifically because how mad it made me feel. 
And contrary to a lot of the comments on this thread he never cheated he was just like that."
3324,"Whenever I would address hurt feelings I was harboring, he‚Äôd bring up how he had never said that, would never say anything like that, I must have said something first. Things about my body, my appearance. Or for example girls that he found hot. If I said ‚Äúit made me a little uncomfortable how you would just tell me everything about random women that turn you on and now I have to remember that anytime I see a woman with __ hair or __ outfit.‚Äù But according to him, he would never say anything like that to me out of nowhere and I must have asked him first if I thought someone was hot and he was just answering. Like why would I just ask him to give me every detail that he likes about random women?? And some of them were so random for once I was actually thinking ‚Äúhuh, I don‚Äôt see anything that he‚Äôs said turns him on‚Äù and I‚Äôd feel safe for a second before he‚Äôd helpfully inform me about all the things that turned him on about HER. Yeah but okay, apparently I asked him to do that for reasons??"
3325,"Husband acting stupid, I locked the master bedroom with me and my youngest son just sitting on the bed playing. He kicked the door and it came swinging back and half the lock and its screws went flying everywhere. 

I said that was also childish ""kicking the door in"" 

He said he ""kicked the door"" he didnt ""kick it in"" and I'm a liar that sensationalizes everything. 

Then called me a stupid bitch for not using the right words."
3326,"My old co-worker was infuriating. Whenever I would disagree with him he would always get angry and belligerent before telling me to 'calm down'. He used to laugh afterwards and make references to me being dramatic. It would always throw me a little and make me question whether I was actually raising my voice or overreacting because in my head I'd been perfectly calm and reasonable. 

It took several other people to point this out to me before I realised he was the one with the problem. Im so glad they did because it's that kind of thing that can make you never want to speak up."
3327,"I ended things with my ex almost a year ago.. He had it embedded in his brain that I cheated on him - I never did, the thought of doing that to someone sickens me. 

After I ended things, he told EVERYONE we knew - family, mutual friends, close friends etc... that I was a (and I quote): *Cheating whore*. 

Not ONE of our friends or anyone in his family took the time to reply to my messages or ask for my side of the story. Even my ""best friends"" his friends' wives, wouldn't reply to me. 

It was heart wrenching because I was genuinely unhappy, for reasons that you don't disclose to a family member (sexually unattractive, mental abuse etc...) which is why I ended things... not because I ""cheated on him"".

&#x200B;

He had this image in his head that I was indeed a cheater and made me seem like the crazy person in the relationship."
3328,"My ex tried to sexually coerce me, ghosted me for 10 days, refused to do anything about it and then tried to convince me that I hadn‚Äôt said no. 

When *that* didn‚Äôt work out, he said I had an ‚Äúemotional problem‚Äù (for having a perfectly normal reaction to a shitty situation) and that I needed to get therapy and ‚Äúleave all of this in the past‚Äù. Yeah, no, bye. I *am* going to go to therapy, but because of what he did to me, and not because of anything else really.

Hopefully, in time, I‚Äôll be able to fall for people that don‚Äôt gaslight me/think with their genitals. The bar is at its lowest but being in a shit relationship does that. If anyone out there is encountering anything similar, I urge you to break up with that person."
3329,"long story short my dad's wife assaulted me a few years ago and my dad, who wasn't there for it, said it didn't happen and i made it up. then proceeded to say that my mental illnesses make me unreliable and i need psychiatric assistance üíÄ"
3330,"GOOD LORD DO I HAVE A STORY. 

TW: sexual abuse


So my ex, needless to say was an abusive pos. When I met him I was an atheist and he introduced me to the teachings of Jesus Christ (I am now agnostic). He would refuse to keep a job for longer than two or three months and would regularly make me quit my jobs and have me work from home. He set up an account for me on a site similar to Pornhub live and would force me to have sex with him on cam every night for hours and thats how he would make money off of me cause he couldn‚Äôt keep a job cause he had a problem with authority. He would make me quit jobs that I had to go to by car because ‚Äúits a waste of gas money‚Äù. We had many arguments about how I hated having sex (being r*ped by) and I begged him repeatedly begged him to get s job and let me get one too. His reasons as to why we shouldnt do that were the following:
1. Regular jobs don‚Äôt pay enough compared to porn. (not true in our case)
2. Since I had a kink for being a bit promiscuous during my adolescence now as a grown adult I should enjoy my boyfriend forcing to be abused in front of thousands of viewers. (Ridiculous)

Get ready for the third reason:

3. Jesus Christ suffered a lot and died for my sins so letting myself be abused should be nothing in comparison

He made me feel like I was crazy and like I was forcing him to treat me this way 


I left him shortly after and moved across the world and have made a new life for myself."
3331,"My very recent ex, who has been on again or again for roughly 5-6 years. I‚Äôve posted in /r/JustNoMIL because of him and his family. Let‚Äôs see the list;

-convinced me his family loved me and everything was fine. I learned Greek, found the real shit.

-cheated on me several times, and gaslighted me into thinking I was being crazy about it.

-got upset that ‚Äúit took too long‚Äù for me to ‚Äúget over and rebuild trust again‚Äù, 

-told his friends I was acting crazy when I asked him to stop messaging those women and remove them from social media.

-gaslighted me into believing I told him to stop messaging ALL women. I know this to be not true now that I‚Äôm out of panic and read the convos.

-after breaking up with him, he kept posting shit to Facebook that was passive aggressive, making it seem like I cheated, making himself look like a victim. I DID do some things I‚Äôm not proud of, but I went to therapy and changed after year 2. We‚Äôd be in year 5-6 when he says this.

- told me ALL of his ex‚Äôs were fucking insane, and I believed him because I was naive. He was cheating with two of them, while still convincing me they were nuts.



All this to say, I‚Äôve been talking to a man now for a few weeks and my mind is consistently being blown with how easy and clear communication should be, along with what actual respect, consent and encouragement... night and fucking day ladies. Everyone deserves better! üíô

**edited to add more because that‚Äôs how my brain works.

- same guy as above, was dating for a year before I found out he was addicted to coke. He got into it with loan sharks and shit before I told him no more. Stayed home and he got sober. Relapsed and lied many times.

-went to another woman‚Äôs house to exchange sexual favours for coke... truly sickening when I think about it. Then told me nothing happened and he was just looking for a hit. 

-used me to use sex to put me to sleep, go out in the night to pick up coke and pretend to be asleep until I left the house. I was so naive"
3332,"Got catfished found out and got blocked. Shit happes. After a while i went back on a datingwebsite. Met a man different name, different photos. But I got the vibe it was him again. Offcourse he said no. Again no contact. After a while again. The same pics, different name. Same story.
After a while again: different name, different photos. Same story. All of this (after the blocking) was in a period of 3 months
Gave him my skype when i called him out. Offcourse he said it wasnt him. I blocked him on the datingsite. And after a few days he had send me a request on skype with his first skype account."
3333,"I can't remember what the situation was exactly, but I was upset about Guy B and was telling Guy A about it. The situation had nothing to do at all about Guy A, he wasn't involved. But he told me I needed to calm down and stop acting crazy. I laughed at him and I said, ""oh come on, if I was truly crazy I would go slash some tires."" And Guy A said ""I'm going to take that as a personal threat. Do not contact me ever again, and if you show up at my apartment I will call the police"" 

I was dumbfounded. I think he said those things so that he wouldn't have to talk to me ever again, but they were extreme. I wasn't upset like screaming and crying, I was angry. I wish I could remember the whole thing but that particular exchange has never left my memory."
3334,My rapist tried to match with me on a dating site. He asked if I remembered him.
3335,"Does my entire 8 year marriage? My ex STILL tries to do it. He twists and turns my words, even when I have them in texts, and will say ‚ÄúI never said that‚Äù when he clearly did. He likes to tell people I‚Äôm an alcoholic because I bought a case of wine coolers (for a party) and it took a month for me to drink them."
3336,Conspiracy theorist.
3337,"When I finally set boundaries on things like ""treat me with basic respect and kindness"" (i.e. on par with what I'd do for a literal stranger), he got angry, defensive, and said that my ""behaviour raised numerous red flags for him""."
3338,"When I broke up with my ex boyfriend he did not tell anyone. I am the one who told his family when I went to pick up my stuff and they ended up asking him about it that night at the table.

He told me by phone he was going to kill himself, I called his best friend to ask him to check up on him, he didn't know why I wasn't the one checking up on him! He had not told him either that we had broken up and it had been a week since I left! 

I am still friends with his sister, and she told me that he told everyone I was gone temporarily because I was in a ""crisis"" (so he appears to be the nice stable boyfriend who waits on his crazy girlfriend...) Because he was sure I'd come back. 

Two months prior he had cheated on me (with a girl who had JUST turned 18.) He told everyone I cheated on him. So now all of his family, new girlfriend (yeah, he got a new girlfriend two weeks after I left him), friends, thinks that I am mentally ill and that I cheated on him. Of course."
3339,"My supervisor at work always went on and on about how he was a huge feminist, respected women, and loved my take-no-shit attitude. At the exact same time he constantly sexually harassed me (always in a ""complimentary"" way) and got super pissed anytime I disagreed with him. I was also doing half his fucking job, making him look good while I literally worked 16 hours a day with no thanks or recognition. I finally brought my problems to the owner of the business, but my supervisor brushed it all off as 'kitchen talk"" and ""just a joke"", and even a year later he tells people that I was overreacting and that he doesn't know what my problem was.

Heads up girls, it's never fucking appropriate for a 56 year old man to tell his 19 year old employee that even if she didn't want to fuck him now, he'd wear her down eventually and have his way. Never. Fucking. Appropriate."
3340,"We went on holiday to the other side of the world to Hong Kong where he met a lot of my extended family and in some kind of freakishly extraordinarily circumstances, he matched with one of my cousin's (that he'd met) friends on tinder... 
My cousin awkwardly told me about it over Skype after we had returned home with aforementioned best friend, which was both uncomfortable and humiliating. I almost didn't believe it until she showed me him on her app. 
When I brought it up, he claimed paranoia. When I told him how I knew, he punched the wall. 

Nein cool."
3341,I had to share an apt with my ex (and three other people) for a year after we broke up because we'd already signed the lease. Early on we were all hanging out and I was super hopeful it'd be smooth. It's like 1am so I went upstairs to sleep and he freakin follows me up and gets into bed with me? Since he's drunk af I explain that if he's gonna chill here with me he's gotta be willing to talk through how he's been passive aggressive since we all moved in. Things escalated and I decided to go back to the living room but he tried to pull me back. Eventually I end up going past the living room and outside and he follows me asking why I'm so mad (it's like 3am) and I keep getting more hysterical just telling him to leave. Nothing like being in your PJs and barefoot in a parking lot at 3am yelling to make you think ya may have lost your sanity.
3342,"One night my ex was beyond annihilated. When I got home from work, he was passed out on the bed. I somehow woke him up and it started a huge fight. He insisted on breaking up with me and moving out immediately. Just to appease him, I said ok but he could not drive. He wanted to drive 30 mins to his parents house, while completely drunk. I took his keys from him, which angered him. He ended up getting extremely violent (not the first time while drunk). He threw me into the ground, twisted my arm, and broke a door/my phone. The next day I told him we had to talk about it bc that behavior is not ok. His answer to me was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just going to roll over. You took my property. I did what I had to do‚Äù. Went on for 15 minutes about how I was in the wrong and he couldn‚Äôt believe i would take his property."
3343,"I had an ex boyfriend who claimed he was over his ex he had a long time relationship with. She left him because she was gay, and he never stopped obsessing over her. I had a feeling deep in my bones that he was lying about being over it and it tore me up. But he kept saying I was paranoid and that nothing was there. 

He even called me her name a few times by accident and tried to brush it off and call me CRAZY that I would think he was still in love with her. 

A long time coming break-up later, he‚Äôs still hanging around her and obsessing over her and leaving thirsty comments on her social media. I blocked him from everything and life feels so much better. 

Ladies, trust your gut. If the guy seems like trash, he is trash."
3344,"Oh my god. When I didn't want my boyfriend smoking weed on my property, he would hide it and tell me that I was crazy and that I talked myself into seeing/smelling it. Or I would see text messages to people and even have the proof in my hand and he would tell me I'm making it up. Every guy I've ever dated will say something and then actual seconds later be like, ""what are you talking about? Those words never came out of my mouth."" It always makes me feel like maybe I'm crazy and misheard it, but it's like, no I know what I heard...."
3345,"I dated a guy who was an all around drunk, I developed a drinking problem as well. 2 months into it we went to our couple friends house for a regular night of partying. We all got so wasted, him and the other guy talked me and the girl into making out. It went farther and farther with their encouragement. 

I woke up naked on the floor with a splitting headache and no memory at all of the night before. When I drink my memory will sometimes get hazy before I even really feel that drunk, I ""black out"" almost any time I've had 3+ drink, didnt know that until I really developed this problem. I tried to get in bed with him and he shoved me onto the floor. I looked around and I was sleeping right next to a door on the ground. 

We talked about everything on the drive home because I was genuinely clueless. I didnt know why he was so mad, didn't know why I was on the floor, and definitely remembered that door being on the hinges. I didnt realize at the time how loosely secured it was though.

He got so mad at me for everything he told me to do, that he threw me at the door and when I didnt get up he just left me there. Honestly glad I didn't because he might have beat my ass, who knows. 

And weeks/months after that he cheated on me multiple times said its because I cheated on him. That *I* hurt him and betrayed his trust. That *I* had a drinking problem and was out of control. 

I blamed myself for everything that happened and tried so hard to fix our relationship. I let his brother and sister move in in a 1br college apartment so they wouldn'tbecome homeless. Meanwhile he was making 50k a year living in a nice house with friends. 

I basically catered to everything he wanted. 

When we finally broke up was because I told him I developed feelings for a coworker and it wasnt going to work out. He called me every name in the book. He threw his full coffee mug at me. He kicked me out before I could get any of my things. 

I knew in my heart it wasn't my fault, but it was hard to break that mentality after he called me crazy and manipulative for so long. I never remember trying to manipulate him, but maybe I did?"
3346,"My ex used to tell me that men and women couldn‚Äôt be just friends. He said all of my guys friends, some I had known for years and knew didn‚Äôt want me any other way, were after sex. Period. In a sad attempt to keep him happy, I cut a lot of really good friends out... but I‚Äôm happy to say they forgave me and we‚Äôd still JUST FRIENDS :)"
3347,"My ex nervously told me that he had made plans with a new ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù A girl I had never met, but had heard about... namely that she had slept with my boyfriend‚Äôs friend who was in a committed relationship. The activity they were supposed to do? Go to the look out point of the town at sketch the view. No no, that‚Äôs a romantic date. 


I pointed it out to him and told him that I trusted him but didn‚Äôt feel comfortable about it. I asked if he felt guilty enough to ask me to hang out with her then he needed to reflect a little on why that is. He got angry and accused me of being controlling and telling him who he can and can‚Äôt hang out with... which I had never done. Glad I‚Äôm out of there."
3348,"My ex secretly went and told all my family and friends that I have borderline personality disorder and tried to convince them that it was in my best interest for me to go and stay with him (he lived in a different country) so he could ‚Äúget me help‚Äù. 

After we split up because he was quite clearly a menace, I found out that his army psychiatric evaluation had flagged up that he probably suffered from borderline personality disorder. Go figure. 

Now, 5 years since splitting up, he still sends me bizarre chatty emails either telling me how much he misses me, inviting me places (?!), or just random chats, at least once a week (which I have never responded to). He still sends me gifts in the post, and tries to make contact with my friends and family, none of whom want anything to do with him, obviously.

I‚Äôm fairly sure I‚Äôm not the crazy one."
3349,"One of my ex boyfriend‚Äôs used to gaslight me on a daily basis. He crafted lies out of thin air and did it with incredible ease. He dropped out of college without telling me. So when we started spending the night together in the morning i would ask him ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be at class?‚Äù And he would get upset and retort ‚Äúi have Monday, Wednesday classes, not Tuesday, Thursday! (and vice versa) You always forget! Are you mixing me up with your other boyfriend?‚Äù  Or ‚Äúmy professor canceled‚Äù. He also got in trouble on campus as an RA for stealing somebody‚Äôs mini fridge. He told me that the resident moved out and that they had to clean the room and that the item was left behind as trash. Most RA‚Äôs salvage things of value to keep and give away. Which is very believable because the room i had lived in left a lot of stuff behind that i kept so it is common. It turned out that no, he actually abused his role as RA and just stole it with the master key. He had to go to court for it and put off his community service until last second because he felt targeted against the system. It wasn‚Äôt until i dumped him that his friend and accomplice told me the truth about the theft. He did so many other things as well including accusing me of cheating on him when ever I had to work double shifts at a nursing home, when he could simply drive 5 minutes to see me working. We had been friends for a year before we dated so I thought I knew him but boy was I wrong. I felt like I was going crazy and needed to write things down to keep his story straight. I snapped near the end of our relationship and felt numb and trapped. He did not want to get out of the picture and went as far as to steal my ssn and other legal documents as revenge. He wanted cheap gifts back that he bought me despite the fact that the gifts i bought him cost much more and that you can‚Äôt take back gifts. He even tried to get a friend to mess up my car. I threatened to call the police and he finally backed off and gave me my documents back. Man, that guy was nuts but I‚Äôm in a great relationship now and it makes to be a funny story I can tell when having drinks with the girls."
3350,"My ex told me he cheated on me while we were on a break, and when I told him it was over , he was like I dont feel like it was cheating, we were on a break... and then he went on fb throwing me under the bus... well karma is a büíïtch, he started dating new girl and she cheated on him"
3351,"He tried to declare reality for me, denied or distorted how things really went down."
3352,"Telling me i said things that I KNOW i didn‚Äôt. For example after a fight telling me that he broke something or screamed in my face because i was telling him to ‚Äúhit me.‚Äù 

Um no- i definitely was not."
3353,"I had a date with a guy I met on a dating app, first official dinner date but we had met up casually before hand. He texted me beforehand and asked me to wear a dress for him. I asked if we were going somewhere fancy that I would need to dress up for and we weren‚Äôt, he just wanted to see me in a dress. I told him I didn‚Äôt appreciate him making requests about my appearance especially since I barley knew him. He flipped and called me crazy, narcissistic and a bunch of other shit. Apparently I‚Äôm the insane one for not wanting to wear a dress to please him and being creeped out he would even make such a request."
3354,"I have an ex who was very touchy, so I told him all the time to knock it off. I had been having a small panic attack and I don‚Äôt remember how he touched me but I ended up clawing his finger (which left a scar). He then would constantly say to our friends that I was crazy and violent showing them the scar. This lead my friends to think I‚Äôm violent. even after I explained They thought I was extremely violent when I‚Äôm not. Turns out he was a player and ended up dating my best friend two hours after I dumped him. I‚Äôm glad that I found someone better and can forget about him."
3355,"I was 19, he was 27. So, red flag right off the bat. He was also in a position of authority over me at the college I was attending. YIKES. He wanted to take a girl out for coffee that he had a thing with... just the two of them. He wanted to take another girl on a looong walk throughout campus. Made me out to be totally crazy and jealous because I wasn‚Äôt down for that. I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, those are totally normal standards to expect from someone you‚Äôre in a relationship with! Yeesh. So many other things as well but those stick out when I think of feeling really crazy. Glad to have a very healthy marriage now with a caring and kind husband."
3356,"The title goes to my ex. He shut down every concern I'd raise as me being 'too sensitive, looking for problems, make a drama out of nothing'. Basically if he didn't agree to the problem or didn't see it that way I'd be the crazy one trying to make things up to ruin the beautiful course of the relationship. And it could be a sexual concern - 'I'd like you to spend more time on foreplay'. Or 'I'd like us to go out more and do stuff'. It'd be turned around like he's not doing enough in my eyes and I always have to find things to complain about. He thought I was crazy because he refused to listen to me and accept I might see things differently to him."
3357,"My ex would cheat on me then accuse me of being paranoid. He was cheating, as I found out when I found his ‚Äúsecret‚Äù cell phone and I wasn‚Äôt crazy at all."
3358,"When I found other womens photos/sexual conversations with him on his phone (several occasions, this was my first HS boyfriend).

He would literally see me look at them (either I was on his phone for something else and it would pop up, or I stole his phone because he was so untrustworthy and I SHOWED him what I saw), and then deny that what I was looking at was true. That it never happened, I was crazy for thinking he would do something like that, and if I didnt forgive him right away, he would threaten to dump me instantly and never talk to me again. I was so afraid of losing my first ""love"" that we kept dating for a year and a half.

I was ""crazy"" during that whole relationship. Never again."
3359,"Oh child. I had a boyfriend claim our ENTIRE relationship never happened. It was relatively brief and I don‚Äôt post a lot about my personal life on social media, so it was pretty easy for him to make it out like I was insane and fabricated the whole thing for attention. Turns out that, while he was telling me I was his girlfriend, he was dating another girl the whole time, and had us so thoroughly under his spell that it never occurred to us he was the one lying. So it only made sense that his next course of action was to lie again. It fucked up a lot about my life, because when most of your community believes the lies someone tries to spread about you, it takes a toll on your mental health. I‚Äôm doing better now, and actually have become friends with the other girl, who was equally hoodwinked by this guy. It turns out she‚Äòs actually really amazing, so the silver lining is I got a pretty great friend out of the whole thing."
3360,"My ex cheated on me, I kept *almost* catching him and he used my recent bipolar disorder diagnosis as a means to manipulate me. ""You're just having an episode, you need to calm down and stop being so paranoid"" etc.

I felt like I was legit losing my shit and it made something that was already pretty difficult to deal with and accept even harder. Mind you, I was on and off medication for a while, trying to find the right combo for me so during this time I really did not feel like myself. I was extremely vulnerable and he was sociopathic levels of aware of these facts. 

Finally caught his ass red handed and called him out on it on facebook for her to also see (not because I wanted to be petty but because I felt like she deserved to know too, regardless of what she chose to do. He cheated on us both for about 2 years by this point.)

The kicker? Instead of just admitting it, he took it a step further and introduced us to each other. Like, what? Like maybe I would get it if it was like some crazy Mary Kate and Ashley movie doppelganger shit, but otherwise why the fuck would I wanna meet her? Still don't get it.

I got the last laugh in the end tho because he still lives in our shitty hometown and works some lame dead end corporate job afaik, while I've been fortunate enough to avoid that sort of monotonous humdrum and live in some really cool places."
3361,"My ex would work with some girls and every night would exaggerate how annoying or how bitch they are, but would especially talk about one girl. I had suspicions about it because I would see them snap chatting each other. One day I read through his messages and bam.. sharing sexual messages and talking about meeting up. I confronted him about it and he denies it 100% saying I‚Äôm crazy, even though I literally saw it with my own eyes. Told me I had no reason to be crying about it."
3362,"There was a gal in our social group who clearly did not like me for reasons that had nothing to do with me. Constantly nitpicking my outfits and suggesting i was underdressed etc. She was an unhappy woman who couldn‚Äôt lose weight or get a bf so she made meed her Target I guess. Anyway, my bf insisted she liked me- she even told him she liked me!- but it was the people who I had been friends with for
Over 10 years who actually didn‚Äôt like me, according to him. Lol ok bro"
3363,"I'm rather perceptive to moods and emotions, and my SO is not. So I'll mention something I can feel brewing and he'll deny it. And two days later the issues finally hatch and we have a fight about something else. After a while I realise it's not what he's really mad about, tell him to think about it and we take a time out. And then he comes to me and spills the beans, which often conveniently explains that mood from days ago. 

But until we get there, I sometimes feel like I'm crazy. And he's been raised to never say what he means. I do. So I'll take his word for it, when he didn't say what he meant, and he'll doubt me when I'm telling him exactly what I mean. We misunderstand eachother a lot."
3364,"First ex blamed me for his cheating. (So did his family which I loved more than my own, I thought they had accepted me as one of their own.) They said it was my fault for spending to much time at the university. (Full course load as well as writing a thesis).

Second ex I lost 100 lbs for. Him and his family kept finding new ways I wasnt good enough and had to change. Whenever I said they were going to far, they would reply that they are trying to make me better. Any objections I had, I was wrong."
3365,My ex would yell at me for having feelings about anything. A perfect example was when I grabbed my drink but forgot about his drink because I was reading something( usually I‚Äôm not on my phone but I couldn‚Äôt help him fix something on his car so I was reading reddit cause he said it would be fast) as I was walking to the car and when I got in the car I put my phone down and waited for him to get in the car. He got in the car and looked at me and said that I should have grabbed his drink and if it were him anyone would think he‚Äôs terrible and that I don‚Äôt think about him. I felt like shit and I really felt that I did the worst thing ever I grabbed his drink and I was still sad and I already said sorry. He then yelled at me and we were on his way to his friends house so he could get something out of his car and he proceeded to tell me to suck it up and asked every second if I was feeling better. After that day and everything he put me through we broke up for a second time for good. I really did love him but he made me feel like shit for a lot of things and I was very blind to it all and thought I was wrong.
3366,"Guy I dated would get really drunk and then get upset with me for ubering home instead of having his drunk ass driving me, said it was because ""I didn't trust him"""
3367,"Wellll. I had an ex who called my dad when I broke up with him. He told my dad that he wanted to kill me and kill himself. He later tried to justify it by saying that he knows my dad was sad when my mother divorced him. Even later, he tried to deny it. He then wondered why I was nervous when he got me a gun.

He would also do things like aggressively chase me (had to lock myself in the car once... then he got mad and kicked it), gaslight the ever loving shit out of me (do things, but act like it all was my fault/call me passive aggressive when I would get upset), and was the biggest hypocrite in the world (1. asked for an open relationship while I was deployed, but all hell broke loose when I did the same 2. tried to have sex with other ppl while we were separated, but all hell broke loose when I did the same 3. Because of 1 and 2, started making videos accusing me of being a cheater but of course ... didn‚Äôt mention 1 or 2 in the videos, and also lied and told me that him and his ex gf were broken up so we could have sex.... they were not broken up). What else... in the middle of the divorce, he told me he wouldn‚Äôt be paying half of rent, but knew that I would break down and pay all of it because I ‚Äúactually cared about my credit score.‚Äù 

I left a lot out, but I could write a book on this situation. And Yeah, won‚Äôt say I was perfect, but was definitely not the brightest to stay in that situation!

Didn‚Äôt escape that situation without severe mental damage, but nothing a little (A LOT OF) therapy and meds can‚Äôt fix:)"
3368,"Hahaha it's not a severe as everyone else's but my MIL was diagnosed with cancer and I was having other challenges in my life. My main group of friends seemed to abandon me. When I brought it up they said I never advocate for myself or my problems are too serious to talk about. They'd all still disappear when I showed up in the group video chat and blame it on different schedules. After six months and serious pleas about how I'm feeling abandoned they just told me I was overly sensitive or crazy. (I mean what sane person would feel abandoned when their friends won't comfort them lol) during the start of the pandemic I tweeted about how isolation can make people more tender. And I was talking to a different friend openly about good ways to comfort friends feeling isolated. The whole group got in the chat to call me crazy and cruel and demand to know why I was subtweeting them! Which.... Kind of clicked things for me. After a few restless nights wondering if I was actually having some kind of psychotic break where I was being a totally different person around them and not remembering it, I realized if they weren't avoiding me why would that be a subtweet?

Good news is I feel ten million times less crazy and stressed with them gone."
3369,"So this was when I was a bit younger, like 18, second job I'd ever had. Ihad a boss who, on my third day, pulled my aside and told me I wasnt allowed to be friendly or joke around with him (even though he did with me. Nothing disrespectful, just more of a casual demeanor), and that if I said that I know how to do something (when he asked me if I know how to do it) is disrespectful. He told me I was a brat, and I dont know how to do anything. Literally made me cry. It made me feel like I was acting horribly when I really wasnt. He also sexually harassed me (touching me and making inappropriate comments) and continuously told me this was normal behavior.

It got to the point where I was having constant panic attacks before going to work, and feeling crazy because this was all ""normal"" by what he said. Eventually I told my boyfriend and mom how I felt about it and broke down to them because I couldnt take it anymore and they were absolutely horrified. They validated all of my feelings and told me this was NOT normal at all. I quit the same day I told them."
3370,"A guy tried to tell me that I have borderline personality disorder because I decided that hook ups aren't for me. He was trying to say that people with BPD go from 100 to 0 with things. Yes, I did hook up with ONE person, and I found out it wasn't for me. But this guy was trying so hard to get me to hook up with him."
3371,"Before I was menopausal (im 32 but went through chemo, radiation and a bone marrow transplant which threw me into early menopause) my bf would blame me getting angry on my period or me being in a bad mood. All complaints that had any emotion behind them were invalidated, I couldn't be pissed off that his shit was everywhere, that I took care of almost everything around the house, he ""doesn't see that these things need to be done because his brain doesnt work that way""(which is bs, you walk on the floor, you know when its dirty my dude). Admittedly I tried to not get angry most of the time because that is how his mother dealt with anything she wanted out of him, but sometimes I would explode because I would get so tired of being the caretaker. He has since improved his behavior but every now and then when I get angry about something he still does the ""your just in a bad mood"", as if what im angry about isn't a big deal, im just being overly emotional about it. I'm not crazy, you just suck sometimes."
3372,"My ex ""being confused"" when I got mad at him for blatantly hitting on another woman at the bar we were at while I was dancing 10 feet away. I told him it was wrong and hurtful, and he acted all offended like I was asking him to cut off all contact with other women. He said anyone he knows would be allowed to talk to whoever he wants. Okay bud, sure. Probably not while they're leaned up against her, fiddling with the necklace that's still on her neck."
3373,"A guy I thought was my best friend treated me like shit after I rejected him.  He kept trying to start talking to me about that personal business in really public ways, probably trying to pressure me, and when I would turn that down too he‚Äôd get mad and act like I was the unreasonable one.  Got to the point that I couldn‚Äôt throw a rock without hitting some random who thought I was a mean person for not throwing him a bone.  He convinced everyone for a while, then he started dating girls with my name and four years later complains on Facebook about the situation.  Ex mutual friends finally thought maybe I wasn‚Äôt the asshole.  Jerks."
3374,"when i stopped loving him and told him so, he wanted to have some time before we could make it official because ""love starts with a fire, but it's actually just like coal burning, your fire stopped, but your love didn't"". and i agreed. AFTER the breakup, he wanted to have a say on who i could like or not, or when, bc he didn't like it that i allowed him another chance for 3 MONTHS and moved on while still on a relationship (no, i didn't cheat, just started liking someone else). he would say my then crush was a drug addict (he smoked weed once with a family member and dropped it) and a ""chad"" just waiting me to get something serious with him to hurt me after and that i was blind if i couldn't see it so clearly. 

almost 2 years with this ""drug addict chad"" and i am my happiest version."
3375,"My ex tried to blame his cheating on: me, being a ‚Äúsex addict‚Äù (he isn‚Äôt). He would accuse me of cheating to the extent of smelling me when I got home and accused my mouth of tasting different after drinking cherry coke or wearing lip gloss. He also would track my phone, which notified every time he did. 

He also told me all my male friends at one point or another wanted to sleep with me, so I couldn‚Äôt be friends with them or hang out with them. Ever. But then he wanted me to be happy and do what I wanted to do, and asked why I never went out with my friends. 

He made enough for me to be a SAHM and told everyone that, but I didn‚Äôt want to do it. I didn‚Äôt, so I worked. Which always looped to paragraph one."
3376,"I found out that every time my ex, then Boyfriend, would tell me he is busy, he was just getting high. To make matters worse, I found out that he was talking to a friend of mine telling her to send nudes if she lost a game of chess against him.
When I confronted him about this, he said that I have problems, that I fight for every little detail and that when he is high, he likes to be in a 'good mood' and fighting with me kills his high.
He then also told me that he would never ask her if I would come to meet him, 600 miles away.
Me being stupid and SUPER SUBMISSIVE actually apologized.  I, 18F that time, spent over 160 USD on flight tickets for a one day trip to his place WITHOUT EVEN TELLING MY PARENTS (they thought I was gonna stay late in college). All that just so after a week he dumps me.
Today, he says I was too crazy for him. I guess he is right- to crazy enough to have fallen for his bs"
3377," 2 years ago Me and my ex broke up but we still went to the same college at the time and all his friends used to hang out outside of the block where all of my classes were, even though none of their classes were there. And because all my classes were there they used to see me around a lot so, one of my ex‚Äôs friends started to harass me and shout at me everyday whenever they saw me in the courtyard, saying I was stalking them and making me out to be crazy. Then what topped it off was I told my tutor because it was constant and it was upsetting me because I was trying to move on and his friend wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone; my tutor called me crazy and told me I was imagining him yelling at me :/"
3378,"Best friends husband (lived with them for awhile). His ocd was top notch level outta control, and he had this control issue, and he would get crazier with each passing month. Ended up sabotaging my stuff under the radar (deflated my car tires, poisoned my foodstuffs, endlessly unplugged my microwave and chargers etc) and somehow convincing my best friend he didnt do it. So we went a few months of me being paranoid over my food, my car, every little thing.

Thankfully, im free of his insaneness now and living in peace with a new roommate. Still best friends with my best friend"
3379,"My ex acting like I was the asshole when I accidentally hurt him after he wouldn't stop tickling me. I tried to old back, tell him to stop, explain that laughing during tickling is a panic response, not a sign I was actually enjoying it. He made me feel like I was abusive because I would hurt him while trying to get away from him. For years it ruined days and made me cry because I felt like a bad person and SO.


 I never stopped trying to hold back, I never wanted to hurt him, but by the end of the relationship I stopped apologizing. I remember telling him, this has been happening for years, if you tickle me you know what happens."
3380,"my ex created fake accounts on Instagram and Facebook to dm me, trying to go on as another dude who wanted to have sex with me
 and then when i told him i didn't know those (completely ivented) guys he'd yell at me and call me whore and liar"
3381,"I caught my STBXH messaging his old FWB saved as a different name on his phone on our two year anniversary, but I recognized her phone number, and he tried to convince me that it wasn‚Äôt her and that was his actual friend, that I was crazy and want to leave him so bad that I‚Äôm looking for things so I can break up with him. He turned out to be messaging her and guess who‚Äôs actually not crazy??"
3382,"My ex told me I kept losing my keys and that‚Äôs why I was always late for work.

It was really interesting how I still kept losing my keys even when I took photos of them in the place I always left them, and they weren‚Äôt there the next morning.

In my massive forgetfulness, I also ended up losing the man two years later. Weirdly, I remembered where my keys were that time. And every time since."
3383,"I went to college out of state (500+ miles from home) on an urban campus in a large city. I had a night class for 2 semesters and made friends with a male classmate, who lived near my apartment. He didn‚Äôt know it, but it was mostly so he would walk with me home, because the city wasn‚Äôt as safe at night. We‚Äôd chat about class as we walked and then I‚Äôd go in my apartment building and he‚Äôd go on to his. 

My boyfriend (of 2+ years) at the time got jealous, accusing me of cheating on him, despite my repeated assurance that it was a safety thing for me and had never even almost crossed the line. He was more worried about me talking to this dude than me being safe walking home. When I‚Äôd tell him that, I‚Äôd end up apologizing to him, even though I wasn‚Äôt in the wrong, so he‚Äôd stop being mad. I ended up lying and telling him the guy wasn‚Äôt walking me home anymore to prevent a weekly fight."
3384,"My first boyfriend made it seem like I was the one who asked for the break up and how horrible I was for moving on.
He broke up with me over the phone saying how he wants to be a man and be able to go out and have new experiences. He said he simply could not do that with a girlfriend.
We tried to give each other a week but I changed my mind and just wished him the best.
I went out on dates, started to gain back my confidence, and started to be me again. 
Well.
He started to text disgusting messages to my parents on how we were sexual, texted me saying I was the one who changed and how dare I move on when he isn‚Äôt ready for me to move on. How I was the one who had clearly been cheating. 
He tried to make me seem like the bad guy in the whole thing.
He ended up getting with the girl he cheated on me with.
I ended up blocking him and everyone around him, ghosted our relationship as if it had never happened."
3385,When they lied about something and deny it when you know the actual truth because you have proof.
3386,It was my fault for being upset and going through his phone when i found out he was sexting his ex.
3387,"growing up my dad would deny my reality, saying something never happened when i thought it did... after many years i wasn‚Äôt too trusting of myself because i thought i was just making it all up. 

looking back i can now remember a few times where i brought it up and he got so mad and i felt that it was allll really twisted. he would hit me and then go on to say something like ‚ÄúI never hit my kids‚Äù or deny my reality, invalidate me then say ‚Äúi‚Äôm the best dad‚Äù"
3388,"I don't know if this fits, but here it is. 

I had a ""friend"" continuosly gaslighting me a few years back. I have a notoriously bad memory so whenever we disagreed on what had happened, he just insisted and insisted that what I said didn't happen and that he was right. There are two time in particular that stand out, I'm going to say the ""silly"" one first.
This one time, through him, I got invited to a Pathfinder game (where I met my current boyfriend <3). I asked said ""friend"" to please be on time, since he's always late (he said he never is, and we're talking 1-2 hours late), because at the time I didn't deal well with new people and he was the only one in the group that I knew back then. We also made a deal that their characters, him included, were going to pay my character since she's a mercenary. We got this in writing too, since he wrote to the GM about it.

Not only he arrives like 1h and a half late, leaving me to deal with social anxiety and my first serious roleplaying session, but then he tries to gaslight us saying ""I never said I was going to pay her, she's just cannon fodder like the rest of them and useless, why would I pay her?"" (there were other mercenaries too). 


The other one is much, much darker. I'm just going to drop the anvil. He tried to  rape me, admitted to trying to do it, seemed regretful, and then... He went around saying that I got into his bed (it was a couch in the living room, we all sat there when he wasn't sleeping), that we made out, then I got scared and wanted to stop, so if they heard me going around saying that he tried to rape me, you know, she's lying, ahah. /s

No one fucking believed him because back then I identified as a lesbian, I didn't date men, and lots of people didn't like him, so they were set to not believe him from the start. Funny thing is, I never said what happened to anyone but my then-friend-now-boyfriend, another three of my best friends (in the span of a few *years*, too), a girl he was kind of seeing to warn her off, and I told about it to the guy who warned me that he was going around saying this stuff. So he could've just shut up and no one would've find out about it, because I really didn't feel ready to shoulder the weight of pressing charges and proving what he'd done to me."
3389,"All of these comments make me kinda sad, not only because y'all deserve better, but also because my boyfriend does some of these things too.. whenever I'm upset with him, he turns it around as if it's actually my fault. He only apologizes that I ""see it like that""."
3390,"A friend of mine kept calling me fat. I knew this, but he was so mean about it. He said he was just trying to offer tough love and I need to get over it.


Long story short, he's a terrible person who was mad I was dating someone else.


Also, my last boyfriend seemed really mad when I told him I was uncomfortable with him going out for coffee with a female friend. Turns out, my gut was right and he'd been cheating on me (not with her as far as I know; with others)."
3391,"When I texted my father that he needs to leave Arizona and come back home to Canada (snowbird) immediately a few weeks ago. No-one was taking it seriously down there, he went to a flea market 2 weeks ago. Then his sister texted him and told him the same. He brushed us both off. Then his insurance notified they will be cancelling all virus health claims after Apr3. He drove up. Now he's back home and not allowed to leave the house for 2 weeks. He's fine thankfully and all nice and tan. Wonder why he's still single?"
3392,"caught my ex cheating when i found someone else's  huge dangly earrings on my nightstand.  he tried to tell me that they were mine.  i started stretching my ears in 2002 and only wear 1/2"" plugs.  :|"
3393,"Trigger warning: family abuse. 

Not a man, but my mom, does that count?
She started hitting me one day, hard, throwing punches and scratching me. I ran towards the street so she grabbed me by my shirt. I took it off and kept running, hid behind my car, which was parked outside. She started screaming 'llok at you! In the middle of the street in bra! You're CRAZY!' I can't quite recall what happened next."
3394,"My ex once told me ""If you had not found out I was cheating then we'd be fine right now.""

Yup."
3395,"I was out with my husband for a group activity with his co-workers (work party with SOs invited). We were going to a bar with arcade games. It was nice to get dressed up and go out for once (since we both moved across the country for new jobs, we didn‚Äôt get out of the house much and babysitters are expensive). 

It had bothered me that he kept complimenting how nice everyone else looked and hadn‚Äôt said anything to me. I finally after a couple drinks got the courage up to ask why he never says that I look nice. His response was, ‚Äúbecause you always over do it. You don‚Äôt need to dress up because nobody cares what you look like. We‚Äôre going to a bar, so you only need to throw on sweatpants. Nobody cares about you‚Äù. I was wearing jeans, a cute sweater and ankle boots. The EXACT same thing that all the other girls were wearing when he complimented them. But they‚Äôre different because ‚Äúhe sees them in gym gear everyday, and it‚Äôs nice to see them in normal clothes for once‚Äù (they‚Äôre personal trainers).

Then one of the girls asked me why I wasn‚Äôt calling him out on the fact he was hanging with a co-worker more than me (they knew we don‚Äôt get date nights much), and I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs because I‚Äôll be called crazy for thinking he‚Äôs paying more attention to her‚Äù. They said I was not crazy. Then it clicked for me all the times he‚Äôs manipulated and conditioned me to think this way. 

I‚Äôm still sadly with this person. It‚Äôs a hard process to leave an emotional/mental abuser. I‚Äôm working on it though."
3396,"When I'd \[ask\] for him to spend time with me, after he spent 10 hours playing video games, and then called me ""needy"". (:"
3397,"Every time I tried to talk to my ex about something that was bothering me, he would pick apart every word I used, twisting my words into completely warped and unreasonable things and thus 'winning' the argument screaming at me that I was being a bitch and how could I ever be so mean to him. I developed severe anxiety around any form of confrontation."
3398,"My ex would hide my keys. I'd look all over the place for them, then find them somewhere I'd already looked. This resulted in me being late to class and work several times. Finally, I caught him replacing the keys where I'd put them to begin with. He laughed and said he was ""just messing with me"" and it was a ""practical joke""."
3399,"I found a text thread between my ex and another woman. It was full on cheating, complete with nude photos. Talking about all the physical things they couldn‚Äôt wait to do when I was out of the way. 

I confronted him. He threw his phone at me, obviously cleaned up, and told me to show him exactly where I saw any nude photos. 

He called me psychotic and begged me to get mental help. I actually felt crazy for a while."
3400,"This is a long story so I‚Äôll keep it short and sweet. I had a coworker last year that I ended up being close with and eventually talked to him romantically. However, I ended up backing away from him after I realized he was manipulative and had so many issues he never handled properly. After that, he began telling multiple coworkers (and friends of mine) that we dated and that I cheated on him, and that‚Äôs my current boyfriend (another coworker of ours, ironically) was just picking up his sloppy seconds. The coworkers who were also good friends of mine would tell me about it. Thing is, they were not coordinating this, as they would tell me weeks or months apart and I trusted them all as good sources.  They would also give similar details as to what he was saying to them. Couldn‚Äôt be coincidence. I confronted him, and was quite rationale about it, but he ended up denying everything and told me that I was the crazy one who needed professional help.

We no longer speak."
3401,"I had an accident that had affected my memory and my husband started using it to his advantage. The last thing I remember doing was calling him at work to come get me and take me to the hospital because I thought I broke my foot and my collarbone. I don't remember what happened the next 2 weeks but my daughter and sisters said that I was acting really weird and calling them about the Christmas tree chasing me around the house and such. I asked all of them why the hell didn't anyone take me to the hospital and they all said that my husband told them he would/did. I asked him why he didn't take me to the hospital and he said because I told him I didn't need to. He just didn't want to go to the hospital. Then he started telling me that he told me things when he didn't, and that I never told him things when I thought I did. I started text him or writing what I said down on a calendar for proof. Still didn't matter to him. He would insist I never told him. It has been several years since the accident and he still tries to blame me, even with documented proof that he was told of things. He still tells people that I can't remember anything, so don't tell me anything.

He also thinks I am either nuts or stupid for not being able to follow his fucked up logic. It happens a lot, but the best example is when we were going through a really rough patch and I just started sleeping on the couch for a year. During that time, I had asked him several times to go to marriage counseling and he wouldn't. Or he would say he would and then cancel the appointment. To make a long story short, he was doing everything he could to destroy our marriage. He admitted then and admits it now. So I finally told him that I would no longer be cleaning or cooking or doing anything else until he either started acting right or started counseling. A month into it, he tells everyone, including our daughter, that we are getting divorced. He tells me that the reason why he was being a total asshole for over a year was because I didn't clean the house for a month. It doesn't matter that he acted like an asshole for a year BEFORE I stopped cleaning, or that I stopped cleaning BECAUSE he was an asshole, that is why he did it. And he still can't understand why I don't accept that ""completely logical"" explanation. He honestly thinks that something is wrong with me for not understanding this."
3402,"I saw this on Love is Blind where a girl tells her fianc√© she self-sabotages when relationships are going well and I thought to myself ‚Äúokay I get you‚Äôre trying to be honest but...‚Äù Low and behold, whenever the couple got into arguments later (even if the debates were legitimate) the guy kept telling her ‚Äúyou said it yourself you self-sabotage‚Äù to undermine what she was saying. I was like ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3403,"My ex was sitting on our couch with another woman while I was home. They waited until I got hammered and sick in the bathroom and I walked out on them cuddling. I tried to kick her out, but he left with her...the next day he chalked it up to me being drunk and overly jealous. he told me he slept on her couch downstairs ...when I went to her house to apologize for overreacting she had no furniture in her living room because they had just redone the downstairs floors the day before."
3404,"Years ago, around the first year or two I started dating my husband, he had a female best friend. He had a crush on her before we met and had asked her out, but she turned him down and went out with another one of his best friends at the time instead. They still remained close friends afterwards. She even pushed him into getting the courage to ask me out before we started dating and for the first six months or so everything was good. Then she started having trouble with her boyfriend...

That‚Äôs when she decided to invite herself over to my boyfriends house every chance she got. Spent the night, invited him out with just the two of them to go swimming and hiking, even came over while we were having a date night. Never invited me and only talked to me if she had to. Needless to say I started having a little issue with this. It was starting to become suspicious that she had feelings for him, but anytime I brought it up it was start fights and me being called crazy and feeling guilty. They had been friends before we dated and I was cool with everything between them up until the point their ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù became nothing but flirting and teasing each other. Even his parents thought I was crazy and kept inviting her on family trips and even to a family reunion! She knew I had an issue too and began complaining to my boyfriend about it, even eventually talking to a couple of my ex‚Äôs for ‚Äúdirt‚Äù on me! Thankfully I was on good terms with one of my ex‚Äôs at the time and he decided to tell me what was going on instead of talking to her. When she was caught she didn‚Äôt even apologize to me, just to my boyfriend and I was forced to make amends with her.

A couple months later me and her finally talk and she at first denies she had feelings for my boyfriend, but keeps saying how lucky I am to even have him and how she wished she could have someone like him! At this point I‚Äôm still being called crazy and me and my boyfriend fight and break up for about a week. After a week passes, I go to my boyfriends house to drop off some stuff he left and talk to his parents since they were there and I felt awkward. Went back home and a couple hours later my boyfriend knocks on my door, clearly upset, and apologizes and wants to start over. He admits that during the week we broke up his ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù told him her feelings immediately and they made out. He said he felt awful and guilty and so we talked it out. We decided to give it one more shot and started dating again. The ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù even came over when I went back to his house the same day we were talking things out. She only pulled into the driveway when she saw me and immediately backed out and drove off. Needless to say their ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù didn‚Äôt last much longer and everything became great and we married four years later‚ù§Ô∏è

Tl;Dr:: Husband had a female friend when we first started dating. She obviously liked him but nobody believed me and I was called crazy. We broke up due to fighting over it and a week later we reconcile and he admits she did have a thing for him and that he even kissed her and flirted with her but realized she wasn‚Äôt who he wanted and came back to me. Haven‚Äôt had issues like that since and we married 4 years later~"

3413,"That's the shittiest thing, using your mental illness to make you doubt yourself! Gaslighting at it's finest."
3414,"I've been in this exact situation! He even accused me of cheating on him, but not remembering because I was too crazy to trust my own mind. Ended up leaving me for the girl he cheated with. 

You deserve all the love and support in the world. I'm proud of you for being here still, and overcoming such emotional pain!"
3415,"Girl... I feel. My ex told me I was needy, suffocating him, etc. After breaking up with me, he kept texting me on and off and even though I saw pictures of him with someone else (I thought this was a girl he was dating AFTER me), he kept denying he was dating anyone and saying I was crazy. Eventually I found out that he was twotiming and this girl during my whole relationship with him and that she had no idea... eventually told her and she ended things w him immediately and we became friends. Lol. Cheaters are the worst."
3416,He was using your mental illness... so he could cheat.... holy fuck? Could he sink any lower? What a piece of shit! Glad he‚Äôs an ex. You deserve much much better! I hope you‚Äôre doing better now ‚ù§Ô∏è
3417,"My ex tried saying all of our problems were because of my depression and anxiety, that he wasn't treating me bad, it was all in my head. I eventually believed him, I'd go to therapy and feel a little better, but he would then get mad saying therapy was a waste and I should just be able to deal with it."
3418,"My ex-husband did this. It was my therapist that made me see him for what he truly was. She invited him for one session and after that she started educating me on a variety of issues. I had justified his previous infidelities and continued to turn a blind eye to his habits while I continually picked myself apart at what must be wrong with me. 
Turns out, you can‚Äôt sleep when enemies are nearby. I‚Äôm a lot better these days and I certainly hope you are too."
3419,I hate when boyfriends do this. If you have a feeling and you know it‚Äôs right and then they try invalidate your feelings or make up excuses. Always go with that gut feeling. You know when something‚Äôs wrong. I‚Äôm sorry he did this to you. My ex would call me crazy and obsessive but he was cheating too. You deserve better and your feelings are valid!!
3420,sounds like we dated the same dude Lmao. my ex literally did this kinda shit. I would catch him doing sketchy shit and somehow by the end of it I would end up apologizing? For not being enough? The gaslighting was unreal and I have severe trust issues now. Wasted years on that clown
3421,"I‚Äôve been in a very similar situation, luckily I‚Äôve been out of it for a few years now. I am so glad you got out too!"
3422,"Do we have the same ex? Because same. Even when I had proof he erased it and tried to convince me I was crazy. Gaslighting is hell to go through. Rereplying, because I called gaslighting a bad word and it got deleted. Sorry you went through that."
3423,Ahhh same. :(
3424,This exact same thing happened to me...
3425,"oh no, do we have the same ex?

seriously, aside from the ‚Äúoffering to pay for the therapy‚Äù part, I had a relationship devolve in the exact same way."
3426,That‚Äôs awful holy shit
3427,"Oh my god my ex did EXACTLY the same thing! Claimed I was paranoid and my anxiety was making me see things that weren‚Äôt really happening eg him cheating, when in reality he was cheating the whole time. He told me to go to the doctor to get meds for the anxiety, knowing full well I didn‚Äôt need them and everything I felt was valid and true"
3428,"LOL this literally just happened to me. Caught my ex on tinder for the 4th time, and then he blew me off for nearly a whole day when I tried to confront him. Didn‚Äôt answer a single text or phone call. 

And when the blowout fight happened, it MY fault because my anxiety and paranoia blew stuff up, and I accused him of things he never did, assumed the worst, etc etc...

Absolutely no recognition of responsibility on his side. The disrespect was unreal. I‚Äôm still pissed so the pain has yet to hit :( I‚Äôve taken him back after worse things, so I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to start wanting him again after the anger lessens. Somebody smack me if I do please."
3429,"I know this feeling. My ex-boyfriend was an drug-addict and i had a hard time, helping him all the time and beeing worried. Everytime when he took something, you could notice something strange on him like he wouldnt want to have Sex, he would lose weight etc. but if i would say something,  he would always get angry and sad that i wouldnt trust him and acting Crazy, and he told me that i should change my therapist blabla    At the end i was right with it every Time, but i felt also bad about myself, it was a hard feeling.. If you are in a codependent relationship like this, it is so hard to leave it, but you should. It was a different kind of time in my life but anyways i think about it often even today"
3430,[removed]
3431,"Fucking same thing here, douche was cheating for the whole six years."
3432,This is straight up gas lighting. Hope you‚Äôre in a better place now
3433,"same here! and when i tried to talk to him about the issue he just kept telling me i was crazy, i had mental issues so i shouldnt trust my thoughts .
truth is, he was cheating on me for 2 years with one of my best friends"
3434,"Same. 

Sisters in sorrow i guess."
3435,Always trust your gut!
3436,"That's similar to a thing my ex did. He didn't *cheat*, but he was an ass who treated me like crap, and whenever I stood up to him it was ""because you just haven't taken your happy pills today""."
3437,same thing happened to me
3438,"I felt this. Ughhh. Same sis, same."
3439,[removed]
3440,"Similar story i had an ex who was figuring out he was bi or whatever and we would talk ab it and i always said that i supported him and loved him but if he wanted to experiment we would have to break up bc im not one for open relationships but id still support him, anyways turns out he was pretty emotionally manipulative and toxic and when i would try to break up with him hed always bring up the bi stuff and claim thats why i was breaking up with him and that i didnt actually love him and i was giving up.......again he was always the one who brought it up during arguments like that no matter how many times i said it didnt bother me and i supported him."
3441,"i hate this epidemic of thinking calling someone -phobic/-ist is a get-out-of-jail-free card. spoiler: people in oppressed groups can be assholes you want nothing to do with, too!"
3442,"You could have written this about me and my ex as well. Only mine was about a month later, but still. He bought me a ring I didn‚Äôt truly want as I was wanting a watch as mine stopped working. A month later I found out he cheated on me. Then turns out he had gotten that girl pregnant. 

But he threw the ring in my face saying ‚Äúif you didn‚Äôt make me buy you that ring and make me feel like we were engaged, I wouldn‚Äôt have been scared and wouldn‚Äôt have cheated!‚Äù 

I was seventeen. He was nineteen. We dated for two and a half years in high school. But yeah. My fault you bought me a ring and my fault you felt engaged to a seventeen year old. üôÑ"
3443,[removed]
3444,That‚Äôs a slick way of distracting from the real issue of him cheating. I don‚Äôt think he was confused at all.
3445,Maybe the OTHER girl was begging for it and he got y‚Äôall confused? So weird
3446,"I could feel my blood pressure rising while reading this.

What a scumbag. Good riddance. I hope you threw the ring at him, if you didn't sell it instead."
3447,Gaslighting!
3448,After witnessing so many failed relationships around me I believe a guilty conscience is what drives random gifting (if not a part of SO‚Äôs character).
3449,That's fucking infuriating.
3450,"Ah gaslighting, my old friend. Same thing happened to me to the point where I would start writing down all of our conversations bc I thought I couldn't remember anything and then felt more crazy bc who writes down entire conversations?! That stone kept rolling."
3451,"My ex did this literally *seconds* after he insulted me. Like, less than 30 seconds. I called him out on it and he outright **denied** it.

One of the many, many times he gaslit me, but this one was so glaringly obvious it actually made me realize I wasn't crazy all the other times either, he was just a lying piece of shit.

This was more than 10 years ago and I still have trouble trusting my own recollection of events and subsequent emotional reactions. Gaslighting is the absolute fucking worst."
3452,My ex did this CONSTANTLY. Every single time it was ‚ÄúI never said that‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never say that‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember that‚Äù etc. He‚Äôd get blackout drunk and do/say things and then never believe me when I‚Äôd tell him why I was angry with him.
3453,This sounds like my mom tbh.
3454,"I had posted this, too! Every guy I have dated does this! My boyfriend will say something and then actual LITERAL seconds later, he will be like ""wtf youre crazy! I never said those words!"" He does this so often and I think truly believes he doesnt say them, that it makes me feel crazy. I can't tell if he is either a really good liar or genuinely doesn't think he said that. Drives me so crazy."
3455,[removed]
3456,"Same mate, same. Glad we put them boys in the bin"
3457,Same here. My ex had the worst memory and whenever I was bringing up something that he said or we agreed he looked so surprised. I thought at some point I was crazy. Until he actually said he had never tried some food I'm actually cooking every month or so. And the last time he tried it he loved it. He denied it so vehemently it was hilarious.
3458,"It always baffles me how shitty some people can be. How the fuck can you pull this kind of crap on anybody, even more so on someone you're supposed to love and want the wellbeing of, as a partner should."
3459,"God, same. My ex once said something to me, I don't remember what it was, and as we walked in silence I just thought ""that's not right"", so I went through my phone and showed him the text from him that was the opposite of what he'd said. Maybe two minutes had passed. He went wide-eyed, freaked out and demanded to know what I was talking about, he never contradicted that, when were we even discussing this topic?! I was really freaking him out and messing with his head! As always happened, I apologised to him profusely, and I just felt guilty and confused and started questioning my memory and mental capacity."
3460,"THIS! My ex will still do this to me, and we divorced almost 10 years ago. He will tell me ‚Äúthat never happened! I never said that!‚Äù  Even though I know what he‚Äôs doing (lots of counseling) there are times that I get very frustrated. I‚Äôll talk to him mother and she will confirm, ‚Äúyes, he did that. Yes, he said that.‚Äù And I‚Äôll remember why I‚Äôm not married to him anymore and let it go. GASLIGHTING IS THE WORST."
3461,"My most recent ex did the same thing! I was seriously questioning my own memory for about 1 year while we were together. I finally snapped out of it when, in one breath he said:

""You sound crazy right now. I WOULD NEVER CALL YOU CRAZY!!"" 

That's when I knew he was the crazy one."
3462,"This is exactly what would happen to me with my ex. He would bring up conversations we had in the past and twist them to where he said I was insulting him or that we had an argument when we didn‚Äôt, and then would tell me that I said these horrible things to him and that he‚Äôs still hurting from them and couldn‚Äôt trust me whenever it had NEVER happened. I would sit and cry over things because I knew it hadn‚Äôt happened, but he convinced me to think it had and that I was some terrible person and an even worse girlfriend."
3463,"Haha such fond memories.. my ex, from a long while ago, got me memory pills off amazon to help me recollect things because he was 'done with my bs, forgetting everything'!

I messed up by believing everything he said, and have issues getting angry - it's hard for me. 
And so I'm still not sure what was real and what wasnt like a lot of people on this thread.

This lockdowns got me thinking that maybe now is a good time to document things out - try and recall as much as I can and write it out. Just so that I know down the line when it's completely fuzzy that these things actually happened (and that I let it happen)."
3464,That's my ex husband in a nutshell! He would even chuckle in my face while calling me a liar. When I could prove him wrong... oh he did not like that at all.
3465,"My first boyfriend when I was a teenager did this. Messed me up for a while. He truly made me believe I was crazy to the point where I sought out medication because he convinced me I was bipolar (I'm not). When I learned the term ""gaslighting"" when I was 25, it changed my life, honestly."
3466,"Omg! My ex did the same thing. Because of this I was so traumatized that I don‚Äôt delete any conversation with anyone. He would say one thing and the next day it‚Äôs like he never said and it‚Äôs all in my head. For the record, I have an excellent memory."
3467,OMG I have questioned if I had Asperger's because I felt I wasn't able to read my partners emotions correctly. Despite me working retail for over 10 years and can usually tell right off the bat if someone is trying to get something for free from me.... Fuck maybe I was being gaslit.
3468,"My ex tried to tell me I'm bi-polar because ""my mood was always different"". Some days I would be sad, and some days I was happy.

I had been incredibly depressed at the time, so most of my days were bad. But, when I was having a good day, it would always be ruined by a different lie I would uncover or some gossip I would hear that he was spreading about me (while we lived together, too) and that would make me upset with him. And that change from depressed, to having a less bad day, to becoming upset that he was lying to me, is bi-polar in his eyes. 

That whole relationship felt like I was taking crazy pills the whole time."
3469,"Pretty much everyone on this thread has had an experience related to cheating.

I'm sorry you had to go through that."
3470,I've never met your mom but I love her üòÇ
3471,I wonder why he planted the underwear? Was it just to accuse you of something? Just to bring you down? I can't figure it out.
3472,"I lived in an apartment with a shared laundry center, once accidentally got some random guy's sock in my laundry when I was done and my ex thought it was completely unbelievable that someone would miss a sock when taking their clothes out of the washer or dryer"
3473,"My ex was so similar! If ever I made suggestions of what to do/what to eat/what to watch he would either outright reject *everything* or say ""I don't care."" But the secret trick was that he *did* care and if I picked incorrectly he would sulk for the entire rest of the day (no matter how trivial!) and then text me later about how he was just so disappointed because ""all he wanted was [one of the other option]"" despite never saying or doing anything to indicate that he'd had a preference. 

But he insisted, to me, to his family, to our friends that he never had a choice in anything, that I was the one making all the decisions. He would complain that we only ever ate what I wanted, we only ever watched movies that I liked, we only saw our friends when I organised it. But when left to his own devices he just wouldn't do anything. 

Like your ex, he never outright said that I was crazy but he always made me feel like I was being unreasonable or really mean. I felt like I was constantly letting him down because he was always ""disappointed"" whenever we spent time together, but whenever I tried to talk to him about it, he flip the switch completely and be like ""What are you talking about? We had a great day, I really enjoyed myself, I love you."""
3474,Omg that‚Äôs so controlling. He wasn‚Äôt allowing you your own independence and freedom. Sounds like he was trying to make you into something he wanted. Wowwww.
3475,">He never said I was crazy, he just kept insisting that what he wanted was reasonable and by implication, if I didn't want that too I was unreasonable.

The details are a bit different for me, but damn if this doesn't sound familiar."
3476,"Ouch, this hit home!"
3477,Oh my god
3478,"I had a similar experience with my ex. The worse part was that he was older than me, my professor at university. He was an awful human. He always manipulated me and made me feel small just to bring his ego up. After I broke up with him, he told everyone how mean I was, how bad he was feeling, how he was sure I cheated on him, when in reality he cheated on me so many times and tried to tell me I was crazy."
3479,"This was my ex/high school ‚Äúsweetheart.‚Äù Reflecting back, I think he felt insecure that I was graduating a head of schedule, valedictorian, etc while he didn‚Äôt have similar accomplishments. He would put me down in front of others and privately via ‚Äújoking.‚Äù I‚Äôd confront him about it and get accused of not having a sense of humor or twisting his words. He would also feed me misinformation to pit me up against folks he didn‚Äôt like or encourage me to not hang out with certain people, pretty much narrowing my social circle dramatically.

When I was finally free of him after three and a half years of getting put down, my sense of self worth had been so severely affected. It changed what university I went to, and what I thought I could accomplish or pursue before and during my formative years."
3480,"My ex that I mentioned in my comment did the exact same thing! Threatened to call the cops on me if I didnt leave his house after I ""invaded his privacy"" when I found a love letter in the open on his nightstand from his ex. Lol."
3481,"I was dating a guy around 8 years ago who had a sound system in his house. You could control it with an iPad. There was an iPad dock in the bathroom and one day, after he left for work, I went to take a shower and turned the music on... to see that he was currently texting with another woman and they were coming through the iPad in real time. 

Fuck that guy."
3482,Whata douche nugget. Defenition of fighting right here.
3483,"Omg, something similar happened to me minus him trying to make me the crazy one.  


He had logged into a messaging app on my tablet while he was at my place visiting. He forgot to logout and I hadn't realized because I never used that app myself.  


A few weeks later, on Valentine's day no less, I woke up from a nap to him and his baby mama sexting via said app. I was getting all their messages sent to my tablet in real time. My reaction to it all was to say ""You can both go fuck yourselves,"" in the middle of their conversation. Then he started texting me trying to apologize.  


No thank you. Some people are so damn stupid."
3484,The outrage some people possess in reaction to their own behaviors just kills me.  What an asshole.
3485,"Came to post a somewhat similar story.  My ex husband was a serial cheater and any time I'd catch him, he'd turn things on me for ""invading his privacy,"" and ""being too insecure to have a mature relationship."" Our relationship was technically open, but he always went out of his way to hide things from me or lie to my face."
3486,"Cheating is cheating, verbally, physically, emotionally.

Glad you still got therapy and out ü§ç"
3487,"Wow, that's a lot.  Good thing you are now free of him."
3488,Insane!
3489,"I just don't understand how men ever got away with conditioning women to think boundaries are ""crazy"". 

You don't want me to threaten to murder you? Wow *you* must be an emotional crazy psychopath."
3490,"Your first point happened to me in a physically abusive relationship, too. Yeah, my fear definitely DID come off crazy - that happens when you‚Äôre being shoved into the carpet by his knees so long and so hard that you think you might suffocate. Or when he chases you with a baseball bat. Yeah, I‚Äôm probably gonna act pretty crazy, out of FEAR FOR MY LIFE. ‚ÄúI just wanted you to calm down‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou were freaking out‚Äù. One time ran out of the apartment with no pants or shoes after the first time he hit me in the face... Never lived that one down and that incident was the reason I needed therapy.. Because I was crazy enough to run away from someone who was physically hurting and threatening me. Sorry, my reaction was pretty normal considering YOUR craziness."
3491,"And now I'm shaking with anger.

Some people shouldn't be allowed to be around kids, let alone raise them."
3492,"Good god are you me?? This parallels my relationship w an older man disgustingly well!! I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre away from that, I can say for sure I have never been as tired as I was in that relationship."
3493,">  would do cowardly, self-serving and inconsiderate shit on a regular basis and then make me feel ridiculous and dramatic for getting upset about it

Same here. My ex was about the least considerate person on the planet but if someone inconvenienced him in the slightest or didn't prioritize his selfish wants over everything else he would act all disgruntled and indignified and annoyed."
3494,"So he is a total idiot but what even does that mean anyways? Sorry I'm just sitting here like... Was he complaining to his side chick about her telling her friends or something? Weird. 

Anyways I hope he is trapped in his house under a stay at home order with no snacks, crappy internet service and a clogged toilet."
3495,Omg he really thought that line would work?? What an ass
3496,Lol why do guys say shit like that üòÇ they try talking their way out of everything even if it sounds stupid üòÇ
3497,Same but my brothers sadly.
3498,This exactly
3499,Preach
3500,[removed]
3501,"Or even better ""Well, you're ugly anyway.""

Did I hear that right pal???"
3502,Just ignore them. It's the only way.
3503,This is f***ing scary. Takes lots of time to ever believe in humanity again.
3504,">always playing the victim and losing control on something be thought to be the perfect crime

God, I feel that like so much. Sounds like my second ex. He‚Äôs the only ex I live in fear of running into (still after 7-8ish years). He took advantage if my na√Øvet√©, probably cheated, and would commit actual crimes that he thought no one would figure out when it was super obvious. Every time I tried to leave him, he would rope all of my family and friends into it. He would call my mom telling her I was pregnant (I wasn‚Äôt), call all my friends and spread misinformation about me. He drained me of funds so I couldn‚Äôt move out. I had to move into my car and go live in a separate city escape. 

When I moved back to my home city after over a year, he tried contacting me again, and I had a male acquaintance do the ‚Äúwrong number dude‚Äù to get him off my scent."
3505,"What happened to all your friends that turned against you? Surely someone that insane and narcissistic outed themselves eventually and your friends realised?

I am so sorry by the way, that sounds truly awful to have to go through!"
3506,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your fault for letting me crawl into your bed and hold you while you were asleep, it‚Äôs also your fault that I was naked‚Äù - ‚Äòfriend‚Äô who asked to sleep on my couch."
3507,Eww. Gross. I‚Äôve got my own experiences of that too.
3508,"Yes, same."
3509,Same here
3510,I feel you. Been there.
3511,Same here
3512,Sadly same
3513,"Same, time and again. Many friends have stories of their own too."
3514,"My ex used to force me into performing sexual acts for him even when I was crying and having panic attacks, then years later when I realised this wasn‚Äôt okay (I was very young, only around 12) he claimed that it was fine and that‚Äôs just what needed to be done for us to have a sexual relationship like we ‚Äúboth‚Äù wanted"
3515,Holy hell. How could one ever justify this.
3516,even if you didn't get closure from him - you know what he did was wrong and thats all that matters
3517,"This happened with my exbf too. I'm so sorry you experienced this. It was confusing to the point of having a hard time believing myself that it actually happened, coupled with how he tried to change the narrative 

His demeanor ranged from sheer surprise I would insinuate such a thing as rape occurred to him being disgusted I would think he would ever do that to me.... To the present day ""you're lying that never happened"" and ""but we've done anal in the past already""

For clarification: he raped me in my sleep, when I was passed out after having too much to drink. Woke up to him anally raping me. I cried and screamed when I woke up and ran away from him, locked myself in the bathroom-he got mad about that too"
3518,Glad to hear that you are no longer with him. And congratulations on the Master's degree. That's huge!
3519,WOW. You are one strong woman. Keep your head up.
3520,"""Some people are a lot like clouds, you know.. 
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go"" - Bring Me the Horizon"
3521,Take all my upvotes
3522,[removed]
3523,"that dude sounds like an ass. Nobody ""deserves"" to be raped, what in the hell."
3524,Agh what a disgusting asshole
3525,"Narcs are pure cancer. They're (mostly, I have yet to met someone who isn't) serial cheaters AND because of their no self-awareness it's so frustrating calling them out because it makes you feel like you're crazy. 

I remember my narc-ex too and I'm so angry at myself for staying and keeping up with shit. I should have sent him to eat shit sooner than I did."
3526,"Or, my other favourite, when they try to explain to you how you've misinterpreted/misunderstood a situation or conversation that they weren't privy to."
3527,"> Getting told by men that I'm lying, imagining it, or making it up for attention is pretty darn common.

Once when I was talking about my abusive ex on reddit I got a comment to the effect of: ""He doesn't sound very nice, but you don't either."" Like how dare I not sing high praises of an abusive ex!"
3528,We have the same Ex!
3529,Did we date the same guy? Lol!
3530,It's sad how many people have dated these kind of people.
3531,"I have literally been told this. ""It is *your* fault I act this way""...yeah okay, because I am responsible for *your* actions and my own. Who knew."
3532,"This is my Ex.  He lies to our adult kids about how horrible I was/am.  Luckily, I raised two smart kids and they see through his BS.  They see him for the pathetic liar he truly is, always was, and always will be."
3533,"My ex put everything and everyone above me and our relationship. And then had the nerve to gaslight me and tell me I‚Äôm ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù or ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù  because he claimed that he puts more time into me than his work and family. I was like Lmao, okay, bye."
3534,"My ex always told me that I ‚Äúneed to be patient‚Äù and that with ‚Äúpatience I will marry you and we will have a family.‚Äù It‚Äôs been 2 years and he has dumped me around 8 times, cheated 3 times, and refuses to commit to me until we have an ‚Äúestablished friendship‚Äù."
3535,"> The idea that a woman should sit idly by while a guy decides the relationship status is deeply troubling, and I'd rather be alone than with a guy who is loath to commit. 

They get mad about this because then they know they can't lead you on forever. Men are so used to having the upper hand in relationships they take offense when women have timelines, boundaries, and standards that don't enable them to fuck her over."
3536,S A M E. He would NEVER want to talk about clearly visible problems in our relationship because it was too ‚Äúemotionally draining‚Äù for him.
3537,"I had the same thing happened. I could never bring up anything that hurt my feelings with out my ex walking away and acting hurt. Then we would stop talking for days and weeks and go back to acting like nothing happened. It was too much, honestly I felt like I had bottled up so much that when I did start to confront him it was more toxic. I had to say what I needed. Looking back the fact I couldn‚Äôt talk about what bothered me was a massive red flag."
3538,"I‚Äôve studied with the GIA and am nearly done my Graduate Gemologist cert. Do you know how many men I know who asked for help with picking their engagement rings who then challenged every single thing I said? The actual scientist who works in a lab who refused to believe me that his grandmother‚Äôs sapphire is synthetic, despite me showing him curved color zoning/growth lines that ONLY happen in flame fusion synthetics, a process we‚Äôve been able to do for 150+ years, because ‚Äúthis is old so it must be real!‚Äù Or a friend buying body jewelry insisting a heavy piece would be more expensive in gold than platinum, since platinum was trading for less per oz than gold on the world market. PLATINUM IS HEAVIER AND TAKES MORE WEIGHT TO MAKE THE SAME PIECE. Precious metal is sold by weight. He at least realized and would admit he was wrong. 

When I‚Äôve helped women? I‚Äôve been thanked, bought dinner. I‚Äôve been respected for the time I put into having the knowledge and experience I have. It‚Äôs never gone a different way. I won‚Äôt help men with this in my personal life ever again."
3539,[removed]
3540,"So much this! Have you found any effective way of dealing with it? I usually either switch to a level they can't follow and throw some difficult terminology around, or go the ""sure, honey"" way with a sweet smile and refuse to be baited... Sometimes works, sometimes not. I teach English to adults and when I correct men, it's so often ""no, that's not the way it is."" Buddy, I studied linguistics, you worked one summer in England in a warehouse full of Polish people and have watched a few episodes of some crap show... I mean, I might misspeak or make a mistake or explain something in a confusing way, of course, but female students always phrase it like ""really? I thought it's this way..."", not the imperial ""you're wrong"". I've also written a book on slang, and men go out of their way to tell me where I've got it wrong, even in social situations where the conversation/context is completely unrelated, they just try so hard to ""put me in my place"" or whatever...not sure if it's because swearing and slang are ""unfeminine"" and they feel they should rule there, might be similar with the political science perceived as a ""typically male domain""... But it drives me up the wall and kills the joy of doing something."
3541,"Oof I feel that. I'm studying political science (major), Arabic (4 semesters), and Middle Eastern history (minor) right now so of course I have a pretty damn good understanding of what's going on in the Middle East and why. 

When I talk to my female friends about it they listen to me, and we usually end up having great discussions and debates. 

When I talk to my male friends I have to literally shout over them to keep them from interrupting me with their wrong ""facts"" and misconceptions, and then they get pissed at me for being too aggressive and try to tell me that women have no rights in the middle east so why do I care so much anyway"
3542,"> Whenever I explain my guy friends something political that they obviously get wrong, they tell me I am wrong. 

Not obnoxious at all. I used to gently and politely correct my ex (who was an idiot) and they would act like I was just being silly and they were this expert despite the fact that they barely graduated high school"

3544,I would have slapped him with that extra physical power I get during my cycle üòÇ
3545,"Same!  So, I began writing everything down and calling him on his BS.  He made fun of me for writing everything down and would still claim I was wrong.  He was a total bully/coward & Gaslighting was his speciality.  I‚Äôm so glad he is gone!"
3546,"Bro. My ex would beg me to tell him what was wrong and if I didn't he'd say ""if you don't tell me, we can't fix things"" then when I would share my feelings he'd say ""keep it to yourself"" and he wondered why I wouldn't tell him."
3547,"Same. My ex would do the same shit over and over again and every time, act hurt and betrayed as if it was the first this had happened. If you don't like me getting angry and freaking out at you for something you know I've told you not to do...then don't do that thing."
3548,"Ahhh my ex husband did/does this all the time!!  Like I‚Äôm trying to talk to him about something that upset me in a calm way. He‚Äôs not hearing me the conversation is derailing so i say we should end it and talk later. Then all day he does things to push my buttons. Over and over and over again. And then bam I snap. And he‚Äôs like geez calm down. You‚Äôre always like this this is why I can‚Äôt take you seriously. Blah blah blah.  

Like no buddy! You are self fulfilling your own narrative in your head. I hate that I let him push me there. and I have worked so hard in 10 years. But finally am divorcing him because I can‚Äôt take it anymore."
3549,"Great question!
Good he is your ex now."
3550,"With people like this it makes one wonder ""is their memory really that bad?"" Is this somehow a *me* problem that I'm not being considerate of said bad memory? Or, as my gut suggest, is this person a lying, manipulative ass?"
3551,Sounds incredibly jealous too. That‚Äôs very creepy to keep count. What the hell!? I hope he‚Äôs an ex friend now.
3552,[removed]
3553,Lmao did we date the same dude? Mine told me bf/gf 'means something' and he has qualifiers for his girlfriend but went around introducing me as his girlfriend.
3554,"Genuinely no offence, but I think you need to consider deep therapy. You‚Äôre a victim of your mother‚Äôs abuse - and quite possibly, so is he. If your ramble is any indication of your mental state, you lack self awareness, self control, boundaries and are still deeply entangled in some pretty unhealthy dynamics. You‚Äôre also 26, for God‚Äôs sake, get a new phone number. 

The fact that you think telling someone to fuck off is a mild thing to say is pretty indicative of your lack of perspective. You‚Äôd just had a screaming match in his house .. whatever the background, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs entirely unreasonable for him to react and say something. Anger feels justified to the one who is angry; to everyone else it just feels scary, sometimes mad. It seems that after anger you might inhabit the same fugue state as your mum.

As I saw, I write this with compassing and concern, not judgement. Ive been there, believe me."

3566,Yeah I don't think she had mental illness. She had a normal response to an unhealthy situation.
3567,Someone I know‚Äôs boyfriend kept accusing her of cheating while he was cheating on her. He had a history of cheating too
3568,Despite the bad situation you got a friend out of it. I find it really cute when the two cheated girls dump the trash and become friends!
3569,I freaked out when I saw your username and thought I commented on here already and forgot!
3570,"THIS IS ME. somehow I always ended up apologizing for my anxiety being the cause of everything, even though my reactions were in response to him doing sketchy, dishonest shit. He made me feel like I was going crazy. My anxiety definitely got worse because of our relationship too, due to the rockiness and his dishonesty. 
I don‚Äôt even know if he was aware of how manipulative he was being. He would constantly accuse me of gaslighting HIM when he was the one doing it to me all of the time. Oof."

3573,"I feel like the way this post is worded will bring up tons of gaslighting stories

Edit: a word"
3574,Oh man. Frick. Writing down conversations? That is so smart and so horrible you felt you had to do that. So sorry.
3575,"Someone coming out of a gaslighting situation realized she only felt that way with him. She had no trouble remembering conversations with other people. It was a real lightbulb moment for her. Not for me, because I forget most conversations regardless of whom I'm talking to, but I can see how that would be a wake-up call. Oh... I only ""forget"" things with him. Hmm. Or I'm being lied too. Or, I only need to write down conversations with him."
3576,"My ex once told me he didn‚Äôt like eating me out and pretty much insulted that part of my body to my FACE, and when I got mad at him he tried saying he didn‚Äôt say that. When it was literally what he said. 

Cue a few minutes later when we pull up to his house, I‚Äôm driving, and he starts screaming at me and when he gets out the car he slams my car door hard as fuck.

Yeah. There‚Äôs a reason why he‚Äôs my ex."

3580,"It‚Äôs terrible... women need to realize that we do not have to put up with this shit. Men are 100% aware of what they‚Äôre doing. ‚Äúbad memories‚Äùand being blackout drunk are the dumbest excuses for gaslighting and should not be tolerated. they just don‚Äôt care. If you let this slide it will only get worse. Gaslighting is horrible manipulative behavior. It‚Äôs a form of emotional abuse and believing their excuses will encourage it and it will only get worse. Men that gaslight aren‚Äôt worth it, they don‚Äôt have a sense of empathy. They are not contributing to your relationship or to society, they are very harmful."
3581,Cut to my ex convincing me that I don't understand sarcasm. I began to believe that I really don't understand what someone's underlying intention is when their tone is dry... But I do. He just lied a lot.
3582,"It is a common theme here. Thank you, it messed me up for a long time, not what I was expecting to happen during our tenth year of dating."
3583,Because he was probably cheating and wanted to catch her cheating so he felt justified and vindicated.
3584,Especially HIS OWN underwear hahaha
3585,"That‚Äôs the thing, I didn‚Äôt even have shared laundry, I lived in a crappy apt so I took it to my moms to do when needed! Absolutely no way any other guy‚Äôs stuff would get in there! Lol"
3586,"This seems to be an extension of ""mental workload.""  Somehow you're responsible for his feelings because you're a woman. (I'm assuming?)"
3587," That's true. Eventually I stood up for myself, firmly and fairly.  That's when he checked out, cheated, and eventually left.  Nothing ruins a bad relationship like self respect."
3588,"Yeah, it was insidious and just got worse and worse.  The refusal to acknowledge any view point but his, and to especially do discount mine was actually the downfall of our relationship."
3589,You have a voice and a vote in your life.  Don't forget that!
3590,Meanwhile he was sleeping with students which is super creepy and not acceptable at all.
3591,That‚Äôs so terrible! That‚Äôs honestly even worse than what I dealt with because of the dynamic of him being a professor. I‚Äôm so sorry!
3592,"Ugh that‚Äôs the worst! Mine was a high school ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù too. It‚Äôs so tough too because in the moment it can be so hard to tell that something is not right, but then looking back you‚Äôre practically facepalming over how obvious it seems. Hindsight really is 20-20. I‚Äôm glad you got out of that relationship! There‚Äôs lots of really great guys out there too, and at the end of the day it‚Äôs always important to remember that your worth isn‚Äôt tied up in a partner!"
3593,"That is just so pathetic of him! I'd love to see him actually call 911 because ""my girlfriend read a letter/text on my phone waaaah!"" 

Honestly it has to be a bluff."
3594,How can one cheat emotionally?
3595,This is 3 separate people haha
3596,"Right! Trademark of a narcissist. I once came to visit him (he was English, lived in London while I‚Äôm from LA) and he stood me up for THREE DAYS because he was ‚Äústruggling emotionally with the long distance relationship‚Äù when I was literally right there. Waiting. In my hotel for three days. But god forbid I don‚Äôt answer his call, or post something provocative to ‚Äúget a rise out of him‚Äù on social media, or don‚Äôt answer his messages while I‚Äôm working on set (working actor). Just ridiculous shit like that. It makes me sad that I actually let myself be treated that way."
3597,"Haha no, she (ex gf who I found out was the side chick), said that to him, meaning she wanted me out of the picture. It‚Äôs how I found out he was in that inappropriate relationship. Sucks but at least I knew!"
3598,"I don't know how they think these things would work on us. Do they try it on each other and say ""yes dude, this is the one, she'll never suspect anything!"""
3599,"That he did. And this wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôd seen him texting her. I was just like, how dumb do you seriously think I am? Also tried to blame me for it, claiming I was pushing him away and he was in a bad place...I was trying to marry the guy. Dudes are so weird."
3600,"Big mood. My dad when I wanted to get an engineering degree. ""Get a business degree, like your cousin."" You don't think 3 years ago would have been a better time to talk about this? Plus I'm introverted, have ASD, and have Agoraphobia. People terrify me. Business school is all about the connections you make. How am I supposed to make connections when I'm afraid of people? Now my cousin runs a restaurant that his rich parents bought him, and I work in software engineering. Who was right about that?"
3601,"Ugh. I've gotten ""hey ugly. better?"" As though I'm going to be amused by their disregard for.my boundaries"
3602,This is the Way.
3603,"Yeah, they get a one way ticket to blocksville every time"
3604,"It will never be the same, for sure. I became a jaded asshole for years but I got better!"
3605,"I feel you, I had a few ones like that, it took a long time to break the vicious cycle but here we are!

You can be proud of yourself for escaping, it was very courageous of you."
3606,"It wasn't my friends that turned against me, it was all the friends of the girl he was dating. 

At the time, I had very few friends because narcissists make a point to isolate you by being overly jealous and controlling. And the few friends I had felt sorry for me but didn't really know how to handle this, people sometimes tend to ignore your hardships, praying that you won't ask them anything. 

Needless to say, I changed friends and all surroundings after that!"
3607,"Exact thing happened to me! 

On a different occasion, a guy I barely knew took a cab to my place in the middle of the night, walked into my house, room, bed, etc. I'm so glad my two male roommates were home and came to check on me when I woke up screaming. Who the fuck does that!?"
3608,"They rewrite the scenario where they ""didn't see any signs"" and ""thought you were enjoying yourself"" and ""c'mon don't be dramatic"". They're the hero in his own story, they can't be the villian in hers, she much be lying, doesn't remember it right, making him out to be the bad guy etc."
3609,"""I was just-""
""It was only-""
""You didn't-""
""Come on, we were-"" (bonus infuration because they make it sound like you both came up with the idea?)
""Don't be so-""
""It went nothing like that! We-""

The weasels will say anything to try and keep you from seeing how it really was, of how horrible they are."
3610,People never want to believe they're in the wrong.
3611,How did you heal from your situation? Did you go to the police? I am facing something similar
3612,combined with a having to care for a baby girl.. that is seriously impressive.
3613,Thank you so much. It's been a journey to say the least!
3614,Thank you so much for your kind words. The strength comes from the village supporting me :)

3616,"Everyone talks about ""the red flags"" and years later I can see every single one, now. I think back and realize a million different times I could have easily and cleanly walked away. But that's not what happened. Seven years I road that roller-coaster the best I could and when I left the last time it was me who broke up with him and me that never looked back. I have realized what it taught me. It's taught me patience. If someone doesn't immediately answer my text or call, I can wait. It's taught me to know the difference in how I'm treated is how a person deep down feels about me. I learned that people say things they don't really mean all the time, but someone who means what they say is worth everything. I've learned that people don't change. You either love them as they are or don't get involved. I've learned I'm not responsible for another person's behavior. I can only control myself."
3617,I am going to a similar direction recently. I have a partner who is very supportive but in the beginning of our relationship he was also asking me to ‚Äústop giving a lecture‚Äù and one day I broke down and i said ‚Äúthen stop talking like an ignorant f*ck‚Äù I still regret being rude but at that point I‚Äôve had enough of these...
3618,"Lmao! I used to be a jeweler and I got the SAME treatment. I finally just adopted a really blunt way of speaking to the men with LOTS of technical terms that left no room for them to question my knowledge. If they continued to be asinine then I would tell them that trust is important to me in customer relations and if they don‚Äôt feel comfortable with my work they are free to find another jeweler. I had one guy tell me he could do my job, ‚Äúfixed‚Äù an antique 18k gold ring with lead solder... He came back with his wife(she set him straight) to have it properly repaired(cost him more money). Things with that customer went more smoothly after that incident. The women were usually lovely to speak with and more receptive to the information. The men were usually condescending towards me, customers and other jewelers, because of my gender."
3619,"I understand you so well... I wrote a huge paper on propaganda and got the best grade and a male friend told me ‚Äúno, you‚Äôre wrong. Propaganda is not something like this‚Äù, I just said ‚Äúoh really? Please do enlighten me‚Äù and then I just went ahead and ask the waiter and ordered stuff while he was waiting to tell me. I couldn‚Äôt care less. Sometimes I hate men for making us feel that we are never enough, never will be enough."
3620,"Why is the go to immediately ""you are wrong"" rather than trying to practice open mindedness?"
3621,"It's not a man but with my mom the exact thing happened. I'd write it down. Years later when I pointed out how it had happened she said I was lying.

Why would I lie in my own diary???"
3622,"Oh, so you married my ex-husband?"
3623,"Yes same!
With a much better man right now who makes me feel so much better about myself."
3624,Oh his memory wasn't bad. He was a straight up lying narcissist. Just to make it more fun
3625,I did take some major distance from him after that (and after giving him a huge scolding about how he was not entitled to have a say in my doings and how disrespectful it was etc) and strongly recommended him to see a therapist for his underlying issues which he did. We do talk again and he‚Äôs come a long way. We‚Äôre not as close as we used to be but he did put a lot of effort into making a change and it honestly changed our entire dynamic for the better. I do still look out for any odd behavior (towards me and other people) and it seems he is genuinely doing better and not just pretending so I‚Äôll be his friend.
3626,[removed]
3627,I really appreciate your perspective and your reaching out. I will consider this deeply.
3628,[removed]
3629,"That‚Äôs awful. Good on you for not accepting his behavior, though. I know walking away from a friendship wasn‚Äôt easy. I wish my friends had as much dignity. As if I wasn‚Äôt hurt enough, having people I trusted rationalize and enable his shitty behavior was the icing on the cake. It just makes you feel like you deserved the abuse even more üòî"
3630,Oh.... my god! Look at that! I always wondered who‚Äôs the lucky person who got this u/ first. Hello! Nice meeting you! Hahah
3631,"Gaslight inception lmao! Truly, my mental health declined DUE to our relationship. And it‚Äôs true, some people are so manipulative that they aren‚Äôt even doing it maliciously. They are on auto pilot, and that is simply their natural way of decision making. My ex didn‚Äôt realize that part of my resistance to seeking help was knowing that any sane therapist would tell me to end my mentally abusive relationship, and I didn‚Äôt want to. Eventually, that‚Äôs literally the only thing that helped me get better"
3632,"Beautifully put. Like, I really don‚Äôt know how else to explain that relationship besides ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù lol."
3633,"Yeah he was cheating.  He was just an abusive sack of shit too in general. So nothing he did really made sense, he just liked tormenting people."
3634,Good thing they are exes now
3635,"Oh definitely. I was 100% responsible for him all the time. Not just his feelings but his health, his social life. If I didn't tell him to see a doctor he wouldn't and then when I finally did he'd be upset I hadn't told him sooner. He'd be upset that his friends didn't text him more often but wouldn't text them any more often and I would be the one to hear him complain about it, and I was expected to solve it. When he had problems with anything, he just wouldn't do anything and complain until I got so sick of hearing about it that I'd just fix it. It was exhausting."
3636,"Needed to read the last sentence so much, thank you! A platonic/friendly relationship of mine has been going really sour recently and I kept thinking what I was doing wrong,and why every conversation ends up in some kind of spat, and that I might be not understanding enough...but it was because I just found the guts to stop playing the roles he assigned to me. And me being myself doesn't fit his narrative. And you put it in such a nice way, I might finally stop looking for my own fault in being me and not who he wants me to be. Thank you."
3637,That‚Äôs good and very correct too. No one can ever get in the way of your own self respect. Love that for you.
3638,"Same!  Once I put an end to the bullying, he couldn‚Äôt handle it and left.  Life is harder in some ways, but so much better in every way.  Wishing you continued strength and courage"
3639,"This happened to me, too. Once he had nothing else to hang over my head or use to control me, he immediately ran away and started sleeping with the next woman.

It was such a relief."
3640,"My ex did this whole countdown to nothing on my birthday and then got mad I wouldn't tell people we were getting married because we had been together for ""so long"" (but we weren't engage). Long enough to tell people we were getting married, but not long enough to get me a decent birthday gift? Really?"
3641,Indeed
3642,"This is why I make it my mission to not believe gossip or word-of-mouth about someone else and their supposed misbehavior or ‚Äúdrama‚Äù. The only person that can change my mind about you is you. Shit-talking is an orange flag for me and automatically makes me distrust the shit-talker, I always assume they have a hidden agenda. I‚Äôve been the victim of abuse like this and it‚Äôs so frustrating and depressing/anxiety-inducing knowing someone is telling convincing lies about you and other decent, unaware people believe them despite everything you do to disprove them."
3643,"I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that and glad you had someone around. How did he get into your house?? That‚Äôs what nightmares are made of. 

For me, I had to be polite till he was out the door, so that he wouldn‚Äôt harm me (I never believed he would be the kind to until that moment!). Lesson learnt from this thread, trust your gut."
3644,"I didn't go to the police. I thought about what that would mean, and in my head I thought for sure I wouldn't be taken seriously for all kinds of reasons (being drunk, significant other, no other wounds, etc) 

I was confused about the experience for awhile after. Im still confused so, not healed. There's a lot of reasons for that confusion, considering him as a person and the relationship we had.... But the main one was that I was in denial that someone I loved that much would hurt me like that"
3645,"Even after you actually being graded for that, and having like an external proof (not that it should be needed, for fuck's sake) that you fucking know what you're talking about? That's...just unbelievable. Some male friends tried to explain to me that when somebody does this, it's a way of hitting on me...but in that case thank you, I'll be looking for ways to legally marry my Hitachi. Also, in one glorious instance, I had the presence of mind to lean to that guy, brush his shirt and say ""sorry, you've got something here...oh,it's just your ego"", but...it was in a situation where I was getting ready to leave anyway and knew I wouldn't have to deal with him ever again. But it's one of my fondest memories :))"

3649,That's such a coincidence!! Do you mind me asking what it means?
3650,"Exactly, I honestly don't think he was doing it maliciously at all. If anything, it was a defense mechanism. He was abused and neglected as a child, and I think he developed techniques for ensuring codependence/devotion out of need for survival. It's part of why I stayed so long...I know he's not a bad person. He just has extremely unhealthy relationship habits. 

And yup, I lied to my old therapist for months about the reality of my relationship, because I knew she'd tell me to stop seeing him. She had no idea how fucked it was. I've been honest with my new one, and she's basically been like ""holy hell you need to stay away from that person."""
3651,"Just realized I'm in this same situation!! Gosh I've been feeling horrible but now it makes way more sense. Thank you both for sharing, it was really helpful!"
3652,"There's definitely a balance to be found.  Responsible people do double check their thoughts and actions to make sure that they are being fair, kind, and positive.  I think this is why manipulative people seek us out.  But you should also be reviewing other peoples thoughts and actions and then hold them to the same standard.  

I learned from my marriage:

1.  Love isn't enough.  If there isn't also kindness and respect there, it won't be a good relationship.
2.  If the actions and the words are different, believe the actions.  Words are cheap and easy.  My ex would apologize at the drop of a hat...then go ahead and do that same thing again.  Apologizing was a very easy way to shut me up.  Who keeps arguing after someone says I'm sorry.  This was his ""get out of jail free"" card.
3.  If you have made a reasonable request, several times and there is still no change, it's not that they don't understand  It's that they don't care.  I spent so much time trying to find the right words to make him understand that he was hurting me with him actions.  I couldn't find them because he didn't *want* to understand.  If he understood then he'd be held responsible.
4.  Leave someone who isn't treating you well, even if you love them.  I couldn't do it.  I kept trying.  I'd never do that again."

Favorite quote of mine....

>No one can make you inferior without your consent.


~Good Ole Ellie Roo.  
She knew her shit."
3654,Same to you my friend.
3655,"The logic is the worst part isn‚Äôt? Like, this person is supposed to be your partner and their rational is SO dysfunctional that after a while, it literally makes you wonder if you‚Äôre the crazy one. I‚Äôm sorry you had to deal with that and glad you‚Äôre out."
3656,"Honestly, we were all too lazy to look for our keys to lock/unlock the door.. So we just never did. I started locking my bedroom door after that. Never the front door though. 

I've also been in the position where I've had to just be nice and sweet until I could either get away or get a dude away from me. Same reason, I didn't want them to get angry and hurt me."

3659,"I know, right?! It‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Starry Night‚Äù in Dutch. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre familiar, but Starry Night is probably Vincent Van Gogh‚Äôs most famous painting.

Edit: spelling"
3660,[removed]
3661,YES! I absolutely love that quote. I live by it every single day.
3662,"Thank you! I'm glad you're out, too. It was hard to feel bad because his logic was so nonsensical. He wanted all the ""fun"" parts of marriage but none of the actual work (sharing finances, prioritizing me over family, compromise and sacrifice, etc)."
3663,[removed]
3664,"Oh! I am familiar and it's one of my favourites of his! That and field of sunflowers...and the vase of sunflowers. (Not sure of their names!)
Beautiful!
Thank you"
3665,"So glad to be of help.  I didn't really tell my friends about this, or our families.  I didn't want to complain.  I wish I had.  Or I wish I had somewhere like /r/askwomen to consult.  

Good luck to you.  Know your worth.  Know that you deserve to have someone who treats you just as well as you treat them."
3666,[removed]
3667,"I can't even imagine going through this without quite plentiful feedback from a few friends, and it's not even such a close relationship as a husband... You have my utmost respect that you were able to figure out all on your own and get out. And inspire others along the way on top of that! Hope things are much better and will continue that way..!"
3668,[removed]
3669,"You support them for a while, then you say: 'I don't want to hear about your relationship problems any more. If you want to make a change, I'm here to help.'"
3670,"I dip. I refuse to let my mental health suffer because two fools won't accept they should either seek serious help or just not be together. My brother and his wife are like this, I told them both to either leave each other or STFU but to keep me out of the b.s. I value my inner peace period."
3671,I used to think I could save them. Took a long time for me to realize that I can't. Harsh but true. Even supporting them is too draining.
3672,You wait for them to realize their worth and be there for them when they finally leave the toxic partner.
3673,"I used to just support it because I couldn‚Äôt tell my friends I didn‚Äôt approve. Now I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt support your relationship,‚Äôbut I‚Äôll support you if you leave and I‚Äôll be there for you‚Äù. If they take me up in that then that‚Äôs awesome, and if not Then whatever."
3674,"All you can do is tell them your piece and then wait until they've had enough. Only THEY will know when they're ready to leave a toxic relationship. Sad, but its all you can do. Especially when they're stubborn (like me and most women)."
3675,"I‚Äôve recently had this problem with a friend and we have grown apart. My friend is in a mentally abusive relationship and refuses to leave. Lost almost everything (place in school, living situation, car) in the span of 6 months because they refused to let a toxic SO go. 

I couldn‚Äôt hear anything else about this relationship. I‚Äôd said everything that a good friend is supposed to say. Eventually I stopped responding to the ‚ÄúBF and I are fighting again‚Äù texts and they stopped coming."
3676,"Not a friend for me, but a family member. There's not really anything you can do. I've tried talking to him about it, but hes still in the defensive stage where he thinks its normal to borrow 100s of dollars to do shit he doesn't want to do, because she wants him to. I've been in his position. I wouldn't admit anything was wrong, and by the time I was able to see it, i was scared to leave. 

So I guess ultimately, just let them know you're there to talk if they ever need it, and otherwise tap out for the most part. You have to look after your own mental health too."
3677,"I never wanted to outright say to him, *""Break up with her. For good this time. You're clearly not right for each other and you're making each other unhappy.""* Because I wanted him to come to that conclusion on his own. 

He would call me up every other week about it, I'd listen, and the main thing I'd try to do to get him to think about it was to ask him if he thinks it's going to be better this time, and if so, why? 

Unfortunately, even though he came to the conclusion of ""No it won't, it keeps happening, I'm gonna break up with her this time for good,"" he would later tell me that he either didn't go through with it, or that they got back together a few days later.

Important detail: He's my ex who I stayed friends with. A lot of their fights were caused because his girlfriend was insanely jealous that he was still talking to me at all. If this were any other friend, I'd probably say ""BREAK UP WITH THEM ALREADY.""  But I, the ex-girlfriend, didn't want to be the one telling the guy to break up with his current girlfriend. You know what I mean?

Anyway I don't know how the story ends because he decided to cut contact with me 6ish months ago, partly due to the insecure girlfriend. I just hope he's happier now."
3678,"I'd cut those friends off, to be honest. I don't have time or patience for that, and I don't want to support people engaging in toxic behaviors. I'd offer them help first, of course, but if they kept going back to it, I'd have to say goodbye."
3679,I remained supportive. End up his girlfriend said I was sabotaging their relationship. Oh well.
3680,"Be supportive but i drop the advice on breaking up and how they arent meant to be. Ive been in the situation and ive been the advice giver. They only want to hear it once, any more than that and it starts pushing them away. When youre in these situations its not that you dont know the truth, its that your defensive about it, dont know how to leave, scared, or ignoring the obvious"
3681,"I first understand and acknowledge that it‚Äôs their life and I need to respect my space and let them know that I support them but love them. Normally I‚Äôll ask first if it‚Äôs okay for me to be honest and say something or ask something. If they say yes I ask if they‚Äôre sure. My friends know I‚Äôm blunt and honest but I always want their permission first before I say what I think. Then I tel them that I love and support them and understand why they‚Äôre with such person or understand that they love this person but here are my concerns, here‚Äôs what I think, here‚Äôs what you need to know, I‚Äôm saying all this because I love and care about you and don‚Äôt want to see you hurt more. I address how they can do better and they know it, how I‚Äôm here if they need help, and then I ask for their thoughts on what I said. They tell me their thoughts and usually it‚Äôs them saying they understand BUt .... and ultimately they almost always choose to stay with their toxic partner and I tell them again I love them and have their back but their partner doesn‚Äôt treat them right and I don‚Äôt like seeing them hurt constantly but at the end of the day it‚Äôs their life and I just want them to be happy and safe so if they think they‚Äôre happy and safe then okay. 

I said what I needed to say, maybe opened their eyes a little bit, let them know that even tho I don‚Äôt like their S.O I still support, understand, and love them- I just don‚Äôt like who they chose."

I found myself yelling at them to get shoes on, or finish eating, etc. It was probably two months of this when I decided I didn't want to be that mom anymore, I didn't want my kids to think of this when they remember me (my mom yelled all.the.time, and I remember that vividly). So one day, I just stopped. I haven't yelled since, and I am so proud of myself for that (of course, we are approaching pre-teen years, so....)"

3703,Chewing pens
3704,"Smoking cigarettes. I quit when I was pregnant with #1. Picked it back up when he was about a year old. Quit again when I was pregnant with #2 and just didn't have time to even think about smoking after he was born. Youngest is 10 yrs old and I still miss the act of smoking, but not actually smoking if that makes sense."
3705,"biting my nails - two years of braces meant I literally couldn't!   
Then I started biting my cuticles . . . I broke that habit by putting medical tape on any fingers I was biting at and religiously carrying nail clippers so I could clip off any bits I was tempted to pick at.   
A habit I'm glad I broke now that all face-touching has been banned!"

3711,"Nail biting.

One day I got so fed up with myself. I told myself how it was sooo nasty that I'd bite my nails without any regard to where my hands have been touching, even if I was just at home. So I bought a bunch of nice polishes and started painting them a couple times a week and filed my nails as they grew into a nice shape. After about a month I considered myself over the bad habit."
3712,Biting my nails
3713,Nail biting
3714,"Ok, since many of you mention overcoming nail biting... How do I stop? :(

When I'm home doing my own thing, I don't have the urge to do it, but I noticed that I bite my nails (well, cuticles) whenever I'm in a slow situation that I can't control: classes, talking on the phone when I don't want to, waiting in lines, etc."
3715,"Yes same!! I can't believe I would drink a 32oz mountain dew before work every morning at 6am....now I've been soda ""free"" for 5ish years...i have some here or there but rarely NEED it like i used to."
3716,Me too! I had a summer job where I had to wear gloves and that totally broke the habit.

3724,"It was my first session. I was 16 and I was doing court ordered therapy after a suicide attempt. I was sitting there being bratty and silent because i didn't think it would help. After about 5 minutes of me being a pessimistic asshole, my therapist scooted his chair real close to mine, looked me dead in the eyes, and said ""dont waste my time and cut the bullshit attitude. Do you wanna live? I can't make that choice for you so if you dont even want to live, get out of my office. Because I can't convince you to be here. You're the only one who can really save you. I'm just here to help you be happier, but first you gotta wanna live."" That man single handedly fixed my attitude problem and showed me how to find purpose"
3725,‚ÄúYou have to be taught to hate yourself. No one starts that way.‚Äù
3726,"She said, ""You're not the asshole you seem to think you are.""

What she meant, and what really hit me in the face, is that I feel like I'm in the wrong for not being the perfect Me. Whether I'm not measuring up to some vague ideal of what I think I ought to be, to whether I'm enforcing boundaries that I need to reinforce, I felt like a complete jerk/asshole/wrong in my wrong-ness for not being perfect.

I needed to hear that not measuring up to some arbitrary, and always moving level of perfection didn't mean I was an asshole. Saying No, and meaning it, didn't mean I was an asshole."
3727,"‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that working for you?‚Äù 

I often get stuck in a loop where I just try harder. That‚Äôs helped me step back and see what should be blindingly obvious: that what I‚Äôm doing isn‚Äôt truly helping me achieve my goals. 

‚ÄúWhat are you going to do about it?‚Äù

When I‚Äôm stuck or miserable and complaining, this phrase helps me see that I have agency in my life and I can use the tools and skills I have learned to help myself."
3728,"Sorry, this isn‚Äôt really a neat quote but: I saw a therapist my freshman year of college at an away campus. I came back for a summer program after about two years and went to her office to catch up. Midway through the conversation, she started crying. I was like Um holy shit did I say something?

She said she was crying because when she‚Äôd first met with me, I had been constantly stressed and really high strung, even hopeless. Now I seemed like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, like I saw ‚Äúa light at the end of the tunnel.‚Äù She said since she usually saw kids just passing through on abroad programs, she‚Äôd never gotten to see one of her patients improve so drastically. She said she was just really happy for me.

I was kind of floored because I hadn‚Äôt really reflected on how much I had changed, or on just how dark those years had been for me. And I‚Äôd been shocked she remembered me at all, much less with that kind of detail. It was probably the most powerful moment therapy ever gave me."

3732,"That anger isn‚Äôt just anger, it‚Äôs a mixture of hurt, sadness, or fear.

He was awesome and it was hard for me to let go. The last day I saw him I thanked him for saving me. He told me that I saved myself, he just helped me along. I was like wow, he‚Äôs right. It took MY effort to get better. It made me feel proud of myself."

3739,"My first session. I completely unloaded about all my issues, as you do. She told me, after commenting the occasional affirming nod, that I was quite insightful to recognize where I was struggling and coming for help even though it was hard. It may not seem like much, but it made me feel so much better. It made me feel more in control when I felt so out of control for a long time. I realized that taking baby steps and doing the next right thing is what matters."

You throw other balls for the dog to catch.""

2) ""Okay I don't think I can help you because you always say"" Yes yes I know, you're right"", it's a pleasant conversation but nothing changes because you're so guarded.

3759,"The one that‚Äôs hit me recently from past therapy sessions was her saying that I will struggle to make friends with people and fit in because 

I‚Äôve been mentally ill for 10 years now (since I was 13). I went to therapy twice a month minimum (1.5 hour sessions generally) for three years. Went to university, went through a lot, and had six hours of ‚Äútune ups‚Äù when home for Christmas one year because I was at the lowest point since I was 15 (suicide attempt, popping pills, self injury, severe bulimia, etc.). The semester prior to that Christmas I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (finally), still off my rocker, fully relapsed regarding my eating disorder (no binging though so more anorexia with purging this go around), bordering on substance use disorder, cutting, not sleeping, making awful impulsive decisions, etc. I was existing mostly on alcohol, edibles, and coffee. I felt so out of control. 

But I was beginning to do the work again. Utilizing the tools I‚Äôd learned (that she was reminding me of... sometimes brutally). I wasn‚Äôt really at a place where I was willing to make the big life changes that I needed to manage my bipolar disorder and she was harsh about my need to do the work. But she said it would be lonely. I wasn‚Äôt going to fit in with people. Something along the lines of ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. Everyone around you can drink and party and not sleep. You can‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs not fair when you desire to throw yourself at extremes. But you have a lot more to lose from doing so, and a lot more to gain by doing the work and getting your shit together.‚Äù She said that I would struggle to be friends with people my age. She said that I need to be friends with people who have done the work, or at minimum are doing it currently. Because I‚Äôve gone through a lot of trauma and hardship at an early age and had to work through that early on as well.

I more or less lost three extremely close friends a couple of weeks ago and she was right. I‚Äôm heartbroken and I‚Äôm hurt about how it happened, but I feel capable of picking myself up, using the tools, doing the work, and staying healthy. I hope that one day they begin to do the same."
3760,"That I'm being too responsible.

I never thought that being responsible was a bad thing till my therapist said this to me. Seems like I always thought about being responsible and that meant I never really allowed myself to enjoy things, never allowed myself to make mistakes.

It's such a simple sentence but it made me think a lot about the way I'm living my life."
3761,"You don‚Äôt have children so they can love you, you have children so that you can love them."
3762,"I'm kind of humbled and sad after reading so many comments on here about people needing their therapists to tell them that they are good/sufficient/intelligent/correct/forgivable...My experience has been the same. It's almost like most of our issues come from how harshly we see ourselves and how Perfect we expect ourselves to be at all times. 
I'm also glad that I found this thread because even without engaging with everyone and without really knowing anyone here, I still feel like I'm part of something bigger, and that always helps. :) Thanks for sharing, everyone, and stay well."
3763,"""Have you considered you might have ADHD?""

At first I said hell no, only young boys have that.
Then he told me more about it and I realized that yeah, I definitely have ADHD. Now everything is different."
3764,"My therapist helped my mother and I realize that my mom‚Äôs husband at the time (my stepdad) was a narcissist. This made my mom snap out of the cycle of abuse, research narcissistic personality disorder, kick him out, and divorce him. I think we both would‚Äôve been driven to the brink of suicide if he kept living with us. That therapist saved our lives by telling us about narcissism; I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be here today if we never knew about it. We are all doing so much better now."
3765,"My husband and I were struggling and arguing over parenting. I was overwhelmed spending most of my time caring for our daughter while he was at work. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt being prioritized. We had a big blow out fight where divorce was brought up. I immediately agreed to counseling and we set up the appointment the next morning. 

During the counseling other things got brought up - I was unemployed, my visa was under renewal, I couldn‚Äôt leave the country and be guaranteed a chance for return if I left, and Hurricane Maria wiped out Puerto Rico And we lost track of my grandparents for two weeks. 

The counselor stopped me and said: ‚Äúwell of course you‚Äôre stressed out! There are a lot of things going on in your life that you can do anything about. Anyone in your situation would be stressed. What you‚Äôre feeling is normal.‚Äù

And in that moment I felt so validated and seen and understood.

3767,"This was back in 2016, and my therapist was an ex-boyfriend's aunt. I would travel to a different state by train to see her twice a month, and used to stay at her place. She changed my life in many ways but in One of the last few meetings, after listening to a year of me talking about my severe issues with my mom, she said, 'maybe the coldness you sense around her is the result of she being as scared of you as you are of her'. 
I came back a changed person and even though my relationship with my mom is still fraught at times, there's definitely more warmth, connection and understanding because of that insight I got from her. (mu therapist and I are still friends and I now help her daughter study :))"
3768,"I was talking myself down, how I often felt alien among my peers for certain ways of thinking they never seemed to possess (or at least never vocalized). And after I explained that, she just kept silent for a while and then said. ""I think that \[way of thinking, seeing the world\] makes you a beautiful person.""  

I felt like I could cry right then and there, and I almost did. I still almost do every time I think about it. I'd never really had someone comment on how I am instead of how I look in a manner like that. Outside of therapy, only once have I gotten a comment/compliment like that since then.

It made me embrace my way of thinking and feeling more and I have since then learned to work with it, instead of against it. Real game changer in my relationships with others."
3769,"""Instead of just being angry, you're angry at yourself for being angry. Who does that serve? Just be angry.""

3770,"Here is conversation with my therapist while trying to break up with my at-the-time current boyfriend. Evidently the breakup didn't work out because I went on to marry the guy.

Therapist: How are you doing?

Me: Not so great, very sad about breaking up with my bf. Makes me think I'll have to be alone for a very long time and I'm afraid.

Therapist: But if you stay with the guy, you'll be alone anyway.

Great call by the therapist. Turned out to be true."

She respondes: ""I'm afraid it'll always be a part of you"" something along those lines. It made me realise that I was trying to change myself into something I'm not, which doesn't work and I'd end up frustrated,sad and angry because I wouldn't reach that goal.

3783,"Very often I would do compulsive and destructive things when I felt boredom or anxiety. My therapist said ""What if you just sat in the feelings of boredom or anxiety and acknowledged them instead of trying to make them go away?"" It really helped me become familiar with those feelings and stop being so scared of them. I hadn't even considered doing that. I just wanted the discomfort to go away. Now I'm much more capable of handling uncomfortable feelings without needing to frantically cover them up with something bad for me."
3784,"I expressed concern about my overthinking to the point that it would feel navel-gazey and he said that he would rather have his patients introspective instead of never bothering to ""look within.""

I was stuck in a victimization rut, thinking I would never be able to move on or be happy until he stopped and that it was not fair that he was doing all of that and not leaving me alone. Looking back, I can see that was mostly a way for me to avoid doing the hard work, accepting all the crap I had gone through and seeing the 8-year relationship I had been in for what it truly was, and moving on.

3806,"Not me, but one of my past SO‚Äôs told me he faced some tough love in regards to his anxiety when he was younger. He said his therapist told him, ‚Äúyour anxiety is your responsibility, not anyone else‚Äôs.‚Äù He explained he used to blame others for triggering his anxiety because he felt if they knew he had anxiety, they should avoid his triggers, but that created a problem in itself. So when he became more accountable and not reliant on others, he felt better because a sense of control was there. And that relying on others for a problem he had was unfair. 

I thought that was interesting."

3808,"""You being apprehensive to being assertive to the ones you love, and even the self doubt you face daily about your decisions in life even when you know they were logiclly sound is clearly due to years and years of gaslighting done to you, by your mother."""
3809,"I‚Äôve been going to therapy for years but recently my therapist hit on some deep down trauma and insecurity. I have to paraphrase for context but we were talking about how I feel the need to be doing something or helping in some way, especially in my marriage. Which was blocking my partner from doing his own emotional growth because I was always picking up the slack. 

She was trying to figure out why that was the case and she touched on something and just looked so sad and said something along the lines of ‚Äújust existing makes you worthy of love‚Äù and it really really got to me. 

We had been trying to figure out this block I was having and she hadn‚Äôt realize until that point that despite all the work we had done, I still was terrified of not being ‚Äúworth it‚Äù. And she just looked so crushed and sad for me that when she said that it made me realize how she wasn‚Äôt sad for me in a pitying way, but because she was so sad I couldn‚Äôt see that I was lovable by just existing. 

My therapist is great. She‚Äôs much more ‚Äúkindergarten teacher‚Äù than my last therapist and it‚Äôs taken a long time to be comfortable with her kindness and patience."

3811,"There's a difference between should and could. You could do something, but there's almost never should. I get to make the choice and I'm not obligated to do something just because I think I should. For example, I could do the dishes instead of taking a break after work. There's no ""I should do the dishes now."" That takes my choice away and leaves me with a near-constant sense of obligation."
3812,"""Can you look back at yourself with compassion?"" I was really depressed in middle school, and as an adult I find that embarrassing. But remembering that my feelings were real, that I was really struggling, and I was a real person allows me to feel empathetic towards myself"

I was struggling with my husband‚Äôs very dysfunctional family and how they‚Äôve never accepted me. I spent so many years trying to make them accept me for who I was or change myself into someone they would accept. Hearing that crystallized for me that their unwillingness to allow me to be part of their family wasn‚Äôt something I had a choice about, and that my only real choice was how to handle myself in the face of them never changing."

This moment was the first time a doctor helped me, who didn‚Äôt label me as a bad child or believe my ‚Äúmom‚Äù when she said I was copying friends. He didn‚Äôt let my bad attitude blind him. 
He was always calm, patient and kind.
Because of him I was able to start to go of the guilt I had carried my whole life. He inspired me,to someday get to a point in life where I could believe him."

3827,I‚Äôm in therapy now and only a few months ago she asked if I can see the connection with food and fluids all throughout my childhood and not only as something that came out of the blue in my twenties. At that moment I actually could see how far I have been having these issues.

3836,"When I was body building, fit, in shape, and told my therapist I was planning on losing 20 lbs. She was shocked and told me that I don't need to lose any weight and suggested discussing this with my physician if I didn't believe her.

It was my first indication that I had body image issues. I thought I was a fat cow. I can look back at pictures of myself at that point in my life and I wasn't overweight at all.

Of all the crazy shit I talked about in therapy, this one really just stands out. It's not as deep and profound as other comments here, but it's what still stands out to me today."
3837,"She told me it‚Äôs not my fault and validated my feelings, but told me it‚Äôs not okay to sit in them forever"

I was in a 2week hospitalization after a suicide attempt and she was right. If I really wanted to be dead, I would‚Äôve just gone all in."
3842,"Although there have been plenty of statements my therapist has said, that have been brilliant, when I was talking about the beginning of my relationship with my now ex husband who was pretty abusive:

""Sounds like you had some reservations there and that you had other voices inside you going: Hello, we're in the meeting too"".

It was the moment I realised that I had never listened to what I actually wanted. It was the beginning of me  having some massive realisations and therapy has really changed my mindset. I love the sessions, because I often have these brilliant ""shit, he's right"" moments and it has a knock on effect for other things."
3843,"Mine has helped me identify that I was thinking about most issues and decisions as black and white, and that really, ‚Äúeverything in life is a grey area‚Äù. I mostly only hear things being discussed as black and white as an issue of morality, and that wasn‚Äôt what I was doing, so I never would have recognized that thought pattern until she helped me find it. 

I was really struggling with how to know what was the ‚Äúright decision‚Äù and what was the ‚Äúwrong decision‚Äù but of course there‚Äôs no way to know- and more realistically neither decision is 100% right or 100% wrong. 

Thinking of everything existing in a grey area has seeped in to almost all parts of my life and has really helped me sharpen my thinking about politics in an increasingly polarizing environment, find empathy and forgiveness in other people‚Äôs actions, and has freed me from always having to make the most perfect choices."
3844,"I can't remember exactly what she said, but it was something like, ""You use jokes and laughter as a way to deflect any kind of serious conversation. And as a way to protect yourself."" I sobered up really fast after that. I didn't go back after that session because I wasn't ready for someone to break through like that, but I will never forget it."
3845,Stop trying to be that person you were before the trauma.
3846,"It‚Äôs ok to feel your feelings. 

When I learned my roommate said ‚Äúshe needs to learn to not feel all her feelings all the way all the time‚Äù

And my therapist said fuck that guy that‚Äôs bullshit. They‚Äôre your feelings feel them!
It was surprisingly validating."
3847,"After I told her I almost got hit by a car crossing the street and didn‚Äôt care if I died then or any other time. 
‚ÄúThe trauma you experienced has lead you here. You can‚Äôt be scared of death if your already spiritually dead.‚Äù
This hit me really hard because I‚Äôve never thought of it that way. At that time I was disconnected from myself and had no purpose for living. I was just here. She recommended I connect with a higher being through chakra work and if I wanted to a god(Christianity). I blew her off about that because I have bad experiences with Christians and want nothing to do with that religion. I was interested in Wiccan practices yet didn‚Äôt feel a connection to that either. I focused most of my energy  trying to regulate my emotions and keep my suicidal thoughts at bay.  About a month ago, I started dating a man who is Nordic pagan and was so fascinated by the religion that I‚Äôm Nordic pagan as well. I‚Äôm still learning more about it every day however it just felt right. I wish I had her email still so I could update her!"

3851,"""You never really had a father.""

After a mental breakdown and unrelenting anxiety after a move and new job, I started to go to therapy. After a few years of talking about how I was feeling, we were able to unearth an entire childhood filled with physical, emotional, and verbal abuse from my dad that I had buried deep deep down. 

Even though I love him, and I have empathy for him as he was also abused, and I had a relatively good childhood by societal standards with a dad and mom who were involved, it became apparent that I walled off my father emotionally to protect myself and that being constantly scared of my dad and having a dad did not equate to having a healthy father-son relationship.

I still haven't forgiven him and I'm not sure I will ever be in a place that he and I can talk about it or find forgiveness."
3852,"Sustainability, not perfectionism."
3853,"It was on my initial phone interview with him. I had interviewed a couple other therapists, but was on the fence. His closing remarks were ""it does really sound like you have alot going on that's overwhelming and I hope you find the help you need."" It was so affirming. I felt like I was crazy for feeling so overwhelmed and anxious about everything and was mad at myself for my feelings. 

Also later on in sessions he said ,""I'm sorry you didn't get to have a childhood where you felt loved and taken care of. Every child deserves that."""
3854,"""Why don't you just say 'No?'"""
3855,"Last session with her before I made a big move across country my therapist told me how proud she was of me and how many steps I've taken to better myself. She told me not every person is out there looking to better their own situations but that the energy I put out into the world and the work that *I did* made it happen for me.

Really made me realize that I'm working towards stuff, that it's not just ""a lucky break"" and that there is always something to be proud of."
3856,"From first after nervous breakdown at 27.  Her response after I told her my history:

""Oh my, you have been depressed for a VERY long time (I estimated the start was age 10)

From my post-partum therapist 10-years-later:

""As an adult you are responsible for you are responsible for your own feelings and actions., and not someone elses'. ""

\- Regarding how my father always blamed me for how he reacts.

""Well, aren't you the most powerful person in the world?""

\- After I informed her how my father said that I was ruining the family because I agreed with him to cutting ties after he told me ""if you are going to treat me this way then we should no longer associate with each other.""

Didn't speak to my father for TWO years.  He now watches what he says to me."
3857,just because she is talking doesn't mean you have to listen.
3858,"Unfortunately I‚Äôve only had a negative experience with a therapist. I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for my entire life and I finally spoke up to my doctor a few months ago. She did an evaluation and concluded it was severe and prescribed me lexapro for daily use, a small prescription for Ativan as needed (for panic attacks only), and gave me a list of therapists to check out. 

So I had about 6 sessions with one of the therapists on her list. My research showed she was highly recommended and professional and kind. So I decided to start with her. 

I‚Äôm not delusional about therapy, I know it takes time to really get things sorted out. I also know a lot of times it‚Äôs common to have to try several therapists before finding the right fit. So I gave this first therapist a shot but after our final session I was honestly left with really bad feelings about the whole experience. 

She never took any notes so every session we talked about the same things, because she asked the same questions. She never remembered what my job was (which is the #1 thing I would talk about during our sessions), and she spent more time talking about herself than asking me anything. 

On top of my full time job, my boyfriend and I also run our own cleaning service for the bank he works for. And during our last session (which was the final straw and I never went back) she texted during our session, and then asked if my boyfriend and I would be interested in starting a cleaning contract for her office (after asking for the 6th time what my full time job was.) 

Anyway. The one thing she said to me that really hit home, in a bad way, was that she directly said ‚Äúyou already have a lot of great coping methods in place. There‚Äôs nothing else I can teach you or help you with.‚Äù 

I was blown away by that, considering I‚Äôve never felt worse - anxiety wise. It was really upsetting that I finally hit rock bottom with my anxiety after 27 years of dealing with it alone. It was getting to a point where I wasn‚Äôt able to function or hide it anymore, and this professionals only analysis was that...I‚Äôm fine and there‚Äôs nothing more I can do to feel better because I already do the self help techniques. 

I left the office feeling defeated. I thought that asking for help would be the deepest valley, and that I would finally start climbing out with some help. But what she said only made the mountains grow taller, and my valley deepened. I spent a few weeks feeling angry, and I didn‚Äôt even look for another therapist because I was just so angry and upset. 

Now this whole coronavirus thing is going on so I plan on waiting til it blows over a bit before I set up with a new therapist. Someone recommended an art therapist to me recently so I think I will reach out to her for help. I‚Äôm just treating myself with kid gloves right now, taking my anxiety day by day. I can‚Äôt achieve simple tasks everyday, but I celebrate the days that I can."
3859,"""Why cant you be both?"" after telling him I am either *the good girl* or *the bad girl* but can never choose a side"
3860,"I have issues with my romantic relationships, I obsess and get attached super easily. I was confused by this because I had a normal childhood. My therapist made me realize that my mothers own trauma made it hard for her to express her love verbally and physically to me as a child, despite being a constant in my life and a great mother. My father was the only parent that worked so my time with him was limited to dinner and a few hours on the weekends but he showered me with verbal praise. My therapist said ""Male love in your childhood was special and the actual affirmation you needed verbally"" and boy did i sit with that one for awhile."
3861,You‚Äôre allowed to choose joy.
3862,He said we all have a major impactful moment in childhood that has an effect on us as adults. He helped me figure out a pivotal moment in my childhood that I thought was just a crappy thing that happened and then found humor in it later as a way to cope.
3863,‚ÄúYour mind is an instrument. You are not your mind‚Äù
3864,"""You are allowed to be selfish"""
3865,"Honestly one of my biggest ""hit home"" moments was not a therapist or anything of the sort - just a friend I met from work. She was taking psychology and we got on the topic of how we dealt with childhood.

After telling her an example of how I dealt she burst into  tears. 

I had apparently described textbook high level dissociation so clearly it matched her textbook. I had never even considered it as dissociation or even as a something to think about as different. It shocked and horrified her that I was pushed to such a point so young.

- clarifying that yeah that was not a good family situation."
3866,"     ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt want to be happy and nothing you do will give her that‚Äù

    The first time I went to therapy was in high school. I was depressed and my mom was a huge cause of it because she was a major narcissist (but I didn‚Äôt know it at the time. I just thought I was a bad daughter). My dad took me to my first session under the guise of behavioral issues. The therapist asked about why I was there and my dad talked almost the entire time about my mom and my relationship. 
    The next time I went I talked more about my mom and she stopped me and said, ‚Äúwhy do you try to please her? She doesn‚Äôt want to be happy and nothing you do will give her that.‚Äù Hearing that just floored me. It isn‚Äôt my responsibility to try to cater to her every emotion and need. That really helped and 5ings have gotten a lot better since."
3867,"""You have grown into exactly who you need to be.""

This was awhile after I'd been screwed over and betrayed by my then-boyfriend and a group of friends (two separate incidents). I felt like I was becoming a cold and shitty person because I set boundaries and wasn't bending over backwards to help/win the approval of people who were just using me."
3868,You are not a failure or evil for having anxiety. Being anxious does not make you undeserving of love and kindness.
3869,"""You're not a victim, you're a survivor"" I had been through years of sexual abuse from a close family member, resulting in depression, anxiety, and self harm/suicide attempts. When she said that I just started to see myself more as a strong survivor and began to heal."

3871,"‚ÄúYou have an eating disorder and it‚Äôs time to talk about that.‚Äù I was hoping I had everyone, including myself, fooled about that. It‚Äôs been very painful to address but it‚Äôs something I must confront every day now. No more hiding."
3872,It wasn‚Äôt a therapist but a nurse practitioner in psychiatry. I told her the general gist of my childhood so she could have some background. She looked at me and told me I was a strong person. It was the first time anyone had ever told me that. It really made me change my perspective of myself as sensitive and weak. It really meant so much to me that she said that.

3879,"That it wasn‚Äôt my fault. 

I was raped the summer after my freshman year of college by my first boyfriend. After spending 2 years digging myself out of a black hole, I decided I needed real help if I was ever going to move past it. I am painfully self-aware, but the one thing I could never shake was that it was MY fault that had happened to me. My decision to trust the guy, my fault for being at his place alone, my fault for putting myself in that situation. She looked me in the eye and told me I had done nothing wrong and couldn‚Äôt be at fault for someone else‚Äôs terrible actions. Seems simple, but I‚Äôll never forget the weight that lifted off my shoulders as soon as she told me that."

3882,"So I havent been to therapy in a long time, but last time I was there I was ranting on about trauma and how it should make me stronger and a better person, but I still feel like crap and nothing special.

She told me, 'Sometimes trauma is just trauma. You had to overcome it to get where you are, and you are strong for that, but at the end of the day you are you. Being exposed to toxic environments doesn't make you better than anyone else, just different. You should be proud of what you've accomplished, but realize its not up to others to congratulate you on getting over your issues, since they are your issues.'"
3883,Wow thanks for sharing. What a perspective-shifter!

3897,"WOW I was in day therapy after an 11 week hospitalization for depression a group of us were sitting around feeling sorry for ourselves. We were playing what I call the if only game. If only I had a job, if only my parents would get off my back, like that. And a 65 year old nurse stood at the door and asked ‚Äúwhat are you going to do about it?‚Äù It hit me hard. I realized that I had a problem. It was the start of a 3 1/2 year recovery."
3898,That must have been really great for both of you to experience! I'm happy for your progress
3899,I had a multi session conversation on how forgiveness doesn‚Äôt equal acceptance or approval which really helped me release a lot against myself and others.

3902,"Mine often says ""what would you say to a little girl with that same fear?""

3904,"I was literally about to comment this. I'm 16 and to be completely honest I'm a very angry person, and I thought that was just that. When is started counselling a few months ago, and she told me this, it completely changed everything.

I realised I wasnt angry at what had happened in the past with my parents, I was just hurt at how little support I received at the time, and how much more they could have done had they put in the effort then.

Its massively changed how I deal with things and my emotions, and I find I calm down much quicker once I figure out which emotion that anger is hiding."
3905,‚ÄúFeeling are not facts‚Äù

3908,"I still hear Dr. B‚Äôs voice in my head at times like those ‚ÄúOther people‚Äôs emotions are not your responsibility‚Äù. 

So helpful."
3909,"I don't understand this one. If you do something to piss someone off or said something rude then you should apologize instead of blaming the person who's pissed and saying ""you're responsible for your own feelings"""
3910,"Yes!   
""how much power do you want to give them over your emotions?""

3928,"I had this sense that if I could just never be wrong, never make mistakes, and be the best at everything I tried, then I would never be criticized or rejected and everyone would love me and ... yeah. It was stupid. But whenever I felt threatened by perceived criticism or rejection or whatever-whatever, my reaction was to try to improve myself and to be stricter with myself. Like, how could I become someone who this would never happen to?

My therapist gently helped me realize that people who are always right and never make mistakes don't exist and that the people who think of themselves that way are generally not awesome to be around. It freed me from a lot of unhealthy expectations that I had for myself. 

It did NOT free me from oversensitivity to criticism and rejection. I've learned a lot of exercises to help me process those feelings and react to them in an almost-but-not-quite-entirely-not-neurotic way, but as far as I can tell, the voice that says ""you're the worst and definitely Not Enough"" will always be there. I can just (mostly) tell that it's lying now. 

(I say almost but not quite entirely not neurotic because I still sometimes fall into the old patterns. One of the best things that ever happened to me was kind of falling apart in front of a colleague, who afterwards just said, ""I've known you for 8 years. You don't have to apologize. It's fine."" It made me realize that I really don't have to be perfect to be acceptable.)"
3929,"I wish I could say that there was something that changed all of the feelings behind the problem, but unfortunately I haven't found that button yet. I did change the way I acted in response to them, though."
3930,"Yes! I've had the mindset of looking far into the future, thinking 'How am I going to get from here to there? The distance is too great. It seems impossible."" My therapist advised me to set smaller goals. 

Right now, I'm looking for a job and she reminded me it's okay if my goal is applying to 1-2 jobs a week. It's a small, specific, measurable goal. In the past, I've set goals to do x, y and z, then give up on all three because it's just too much at once. Remind yourself that it's okay if you just do x for a little bit. Once you acclimate to that change, you can build in y. Lastly, it's okay if you have a bad day that ends up being a wash. Get through the day. Get some rest. Try again tomorrow."
3931,"It has in my case. It started with things I could improve in my habits and routines, I started paying more attention to small things that make me happy (watching the sky, taking care of my plants). I started taking a good look at what friends I had and whether they actually suited me or were good for me, took up hobbies and through that got better friends. Now I'm in a happy healthy relationship and still working through trauma, but I can honestly say I'm happy where I am, and I have been either suicidal or depressed for a great part of my life."
3932,Yes
3933,"Thank you for all of your replies. I got good news today, so it looks like things do get better. üòä"
3934,I'd like to think that any therapist worth their qualifications would know when and when not to use that kind of technique.
3935,"I definitely needed the sternness to help me stop being bratty, but what really hit me is the idea that if I really wanted to kill myself, all the therapy and meds in the world wouldn't help me. Nobody was coming to save me except me."

3937,"I use ‚Äúwhat are you going to do about it‚Äù all the time now. Sometimes, the answer is ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, but at least I‚Äôm being honest with myself. It‚Äôs just such a helpful phrase."
3938,"I assume it means think back on your past. Potentially about previous traumas that they've overcome. ""Look back"" on it. But don't let the thought pull you back in and undo some of the progress you've made."
3939,It's hard to move forward if you keep on living in the past.  That's how I interpreted it.
3940,I can't tell you how freeing it was to let go of the guilt of not loving my mother.  I had no idea it was okay
3941,So so hard to live by but the only way to keep yourself sane
3942,"Obviously if I slap someone across the face it‚Äôs my fault.

However I come from a family where people would get mad for no reason whatsoever and then they would look for something to yell about.

Example: when I didn‚Äôt do the laundry I get yelled at for treating my mother like a slave 

When I DID do the laundry I got yelled at for trying to isolate myself from the family by not allowing my mother to wash my clothes


As a result I was living my live just constantly calculating other people‚Äôs reactions and emotions  for each situation. If you spend every minute of your day thinking about different terrible outcomes for every action at some point that will drive you crazy. So yeah for me it was important to hear that other people‚Äôs feelings were not my responsibility because their anger 90% of the time wasn‚Äôt justified but  it was driving me to the point where I was just people pleasing the whole day and didn‚Äôt make decisions based on what I would like for myself anymore but on which outcome had the smallest chance of someone getting angry about it."
3943,Ditto!!
3944,I‚Äôm glad this helped. Good luck.
3945,I know!!! Lol
3946,Thank you! I was in the best place I‚Äôd ever been prior to this pandemic mess affecting my entire life lol. So if the situation was going to happen this time in my life was probably the best. It‚Äôs just not worth getting sick again so my mental health has just needed to take priority.
3947,"Let's just say that he gave me a list of like 15 symptoms common in ADHD and 10 of them fit me perfectly.
If you're curious or think you might have it I honestly suggest googling and try to find a site that at least seem reliable."
3948,"Waiting for quaruntine to be over so I can see a psychiatrist and eventually a therapist. I haven't had a single good e,xperience with them or counselors. The issue is that I'm always too self aware, and I give too good of a reasoning for the negative sides in life. They don't see how they can get around it and help I guess"
3949,"Wow i really wish my wife would come to this realization.

Stuff like this needs to be heard by more and more folks (men & women) so we can stop shaming others for making mistakes and work towards a society that accepts one another for all of our flaws as well as strengths."
3950,"Thank you for sharing your experience! Just know it means a lot to at least one person out there :). If you don't mind sharing, what kind of exercises do you do to process the oversensitivity to criticism and rejection?"
3951,They do indeed
3952,"Someone on Reddit (probably /r/getmotivated) had a post that asked, ""What would you do to make progress?""  I wrote that out and stuck it to my computer where I see it all the time.  It helps remind me that I need to DO something to get where I want to be; passively sitting around waiting for things isn't helpful."
3953,"Same. When I overthink and stress about things, I always ask myself ""what can you do about it right now?"" and if the answer is nothing, I gotta let it go and stop overthinking. I am kinda worried it'll lead to laziness or procrastination if overused, so gotta keep an eye on that"
3954,Taking responsibility for the illness is an important first step. Once you do that you can begin to r3cover
3955,"Reading the stoics and learning about DBT/CBT has helped me a lot, but I'm not sure if exercises was the most accurate word I could have used to describe my strategies. When I'm having an anxiety attack, I try to write down exactly what is happening, so that I can separate what is real from the disasters my brain cooks up. (I am the queen of thought patterns like: ""I haven't heard from my friend in longer than I expected"" equals ""My friend is mad at me and never really liked me anyway"" equals ""It makes sense because I am basically the worst person ever"". Not fun. I don't recommend it.) 

I also try to remind myself of a few truths: 

 - The feelings are uncomfortable, but they are not dangerous. I can live with a feeling and wait for it to pass. I don't need to act in an attempt to end it because it won't actually hurt me. I don't have to ask 'are you mad at me?' or try to fix the flaw in myself that I imagine led to the situation. I just have to wait for the feeling to pass. 

 - The feeling WILL pass. One of the most valuable books I've read, Awareness by Anthony DeMello, says something like ""The feeling is in you. Not in the world. When you change, the world will change."" He compares it to looking through a dirty window. The feeling might be happening right now, but soon it will not be happening and everything will seem different. 

 - Anxiety is an experience, not a state of being. I try to frame my feelings in those terms. ""I am experiencing anxiety."" ""Anxiety is happening right now."" Or, ""My brain is overdoing the chemicals right now."" Anything to remind me that this is some bullshit that is happening to me but not the way the world really is, and definitely not a signal that I need to do anything to change myself or the world. 

 - I am in charge of my actions even though I am not in charge of my feelings. 

 - This is the least helpful of the strategies when I'm in a spiral, but when I'm not, purposefully focusing on these thoughts makes me stronger for when I am. I think about all of the times people I love and like have screwed up or been disappointed or pissed me off. I don't wish that they were better or different, so on some level I should accept that they don't wish that of me."
3956,"I can't begin to express how thankful I am for this post. I used to have a serious anxiety issue that really shaped who I've become and how I see the world. Despite effectively managing my anxiety, I can feel the residue of it's influence in other aspects of my life. 

> I am the queen of thought patterns like: ""I haven't heard from my friend in longer than I expected"" equals ""My friend is mad at me and never really liked me anyway"" equals ""It makes sense because I am basically the worst person ever"".

I particularly resonate with this because I recently had an experience like this where I was getting anxious about what someone thought of me but it turns out it was an entirely different matter. 

I'm saving your comment and I wanna work those exercises into my life. Thanks so much for this, it really does mean a lot to me! Be well!"
3957,Myself
3958,Who says I‚Äôm successful?
3959,"No single individual beyond myself but a whole lot of favorable conditions, like being born white, mostly healthy, in Canada, and with a pair of loving parents. Those factors certainly helped."
3960,Dumb luck.
3961,My parents. My parents expected me to do good in school but always reminded me that they won‚Äôt reward good grades or punish bad grades but that the real world will when I get older. That stuck with me at a young age and made me realize that if I want to be successful I need to put my head down and do the work and not focus so much on getting praise.
3962,My oldest daughter. She's probably the reason I'm alive at all.
3963,My parents. I grew up very poor but I was fortunate enough to have two parents who constantly sacrificed and went without so that my siblings and I had all the necessities. I'm also very conscious of the fact that a lot of my success is owed to the women who came before me and broke the barriers to entry in my profession - the class composites at my law school tell that story clearly.
3964,"My family, friends, and just anyone who has believed in me and helped me to become a better individual. Including some of the professors, internship mentors, my doctor, therapist,  scholarship donors, nice random strangers and more. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm successful but I owe them a lot for letting me study in the university. I am definitely planning to give back what I received in the future."
3965,Spite.
3966,"The doctor who took a chance on me and hired me as her first assist straight out of nursing school.  She started a chain reaction that got me higher on the ladder and paid significantly better than anyone with my credentials has any business being. 

If I have seen further, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants."
3967,My god damn self.
3968,"A lot of it was my parents if I‚Äôm being honest. They instilled a great work ethic in me, paid for all my schooling and tutors, took care of all my bills throughout grad school. I really only had to focus on school and networking so I‚Äôm very grateful."
3969,My hard work and family support
3970,"My parents, friends, teachers and those who mentored me."
3971,"God, Parents, friends, me"
3972,Myself. Hur hur.
3973, My mother and myself
3974,My Mama
3975,Me.
3976,My parents and myself.
3977,Yup. People were supportive along the way but I worked so damn hard to get to where I am today. Sometimes I can‚Äôt believe I actually made it.
3978,Came here to say that.
3979,"I was terrified for about a year and had terrible insomnia. I don‚Äôt think people noticed but I definitely sat back quietly and learned as much as I could rather than trying to lead. Eleven years later, I‚Äôm still at the company doing a bigger job, earning more and leading. It‚Äôs been a great ride. I‚Äôm a firm believer in fake it til you make it, despite the sleepless nights."
3980,"Turns out I was qualified after all. I had read stats to my boyfriend about how women only apply to jobs they match 100% where men apply to jobs they match 70% posted qualifications. Forward a couple weeks after and I see a job that I match 75%, exactly what and where I want. Iffy on applying because I didn't think I qualify. He reminded me of the article and told me to ""apply like a man"". Great interview, loving the job!"
3981,"I could do most of what the job description (graphic designer) skills listed were, EXCEPT the bachelors degree. I have an associates degree. It took a month or two to get to a phone interview, and then maybe another month until I got the call to offer me the job! 

I did eventually ask- because I know there was plenty of competition for the position, even if it was entry-level. He said ‚Äúbecause I saw you could draw‚Äù referencing the small portfolio link I sent. It still brings happy-tears to my eyes.

As a kid, I always loves drawing. After bullying and getting older, I stopped, because I didn‚Äôt want to be a ‚Äústarving artist‚Äù amongst other reasons. I came back around to art in college. 

I knew drawing was an asset to a graphic designer, but I still believed no one would hire me by looking at my art. I still think my portfolio work is just ‚Äúokay‚Äù, and it still blows my mind that THAT is what made me ‚Äúenough‚Äù to be chosen amount the 40+ other potential candidates."
3982,"Best decision I‚Äôve ever made! It really is my dream job. The secret is, if you put in the work, no one is really going to notice."
3983,"I applied to be a mechanical management intern after leaving engineering school and now I‚Äôm finishing a BA online. I applied because a friend of my parents worked at this organization and said I‚Äôd be perfect for it. Huge application process, lots of interviews, eventually they flew me down to Dallas for a panel interview and the whole time I kept thinking ‚Äúyou may not be an engineer but by god you have something to offer‚Äù so I ended up having the best damn interview of my life and I got the gig!!!! I‚Äôm only an intern but there‚Äôs a chance they‚Äôll hire me when I finish my degree :)"
3984,"the job i have right now. they told me it was going to be way too much.... it is, lol."
3985,I somehow landed a semi-leadership postion early in my tenure. All upper management left and suddenly I was heading the department with less than 6mo experience. That promotion has saved my career in the midst of the corona crisis where 90% of my coworkers were furloughed.
3986,"My current job (O&P tech). I was stuck in an avionics/manufacturing position for a year, and due to lack of demand (basically), business was going downhill and our hours were getting cut. It went on over the holidays, and kept getting pushed back months at a time with promises that ""it'll pick up soon."" I liked my old job, so I kind of dragged my feet applying for new ones. My grandfather is a patient at this clinic and he told me they were looking to hire a tech. After some push and shove, I finally applied for the position I knew nothing about, and didn't really have any relevant experience in. An interview and two days of shadowing later, I got hired, and this is by far the best job I've ever had in my 22 years of working. My coworkers are fantastic, and it's a pretty rewarding job. It also completely turned around my financial situation.

I definitely didn't expect to actually get hired at this place. It never hurts to apply!"
3987,"My current job! Am now friends with the person who interviewed me and found out I was less qualified than the other top applicant on paper but interviewed better so they hired me!

&#x200B;

That said I'm in the public sector so it's important to know which skills are REQUIRED and which are not. We usually can't get around degrees but we can spin experience to be more specific."
3988,Yall I was kind of hoping trump would be on this thread
3989,"So technically I didn't have the two years of experience that my current job requires.  I was told I had to apply by a couple of people who already worked there.  It was partly their recommending me that helped me through the gate, but they loved me in the interview.

Long ago I was a waitress, when I was interviewing I admitted that my weakness was my lack of experience.  The manager told me that he wants that due to so many bringing over bad habits from other workplaces.  I took that slice of wisdom to heart and used that in the interview for my current job.  I don't have the experience, but I'm willing to learn and am the clean slate for habits, teach me your ways type thing."
3990,I didn't exactly apply for the job. I applied for an administrative position in one city and started the interview process. During the process the mamager thought I'd be an ideal fit for a position they'd been trying to fill for a year. The process moved forward and I ended up getting the position and relocated for it. I'm now in a totally male dominated field I never expected.
3991,"The job itself was something in my major but not my expertise. I was very confident, dressed well and friendly. I think that's a good combination overall. Confidence is the key. Few days later I've got the message that I got the job, they stressed that I left a good impression and how likeable I am. Yeah that's it."
3992,"My current job. Getting paid pretty well with amazing benefits. In my head I wasn‚Äôt qualified. I‚Äôm a college dropout, so I assumed employers would turn me down just for the fact that I never completed a degree (still don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs naive or not). When I went into training for the job, they asked who all was referred to the job by someone else. A sea of hands went up. 


Turns out this job that I thought I needed a million qualifications for, was filled with people who got the job just by knowing someone who already worked there & was considered a good employee."
3993,"My current job felt like that. I wasn't even going to apply except my manager at the time told me to just go for it, and not to let my inexperience in the field put me off. I had only been working in that field for 7 months so I definitely didn't feel qualified to make the next step up and into my first management role. I knew there were other people up for the job who had worked there longer, who had more experience in the field etc.

But hey I got it and it's been over a year now and I'm really happy."
3994,"I was an internal applicant and with no management experience. I had so much insecurities and no hope of ever getting it that at the end of interview, I told them to pick the best candidate for the job because I can work with anyone.  Not sure if they listened because they picked me."
3995,"I said I had a lot of experience using Office suite and Adobe suite. Boom! Hired! Taking that graphic design class was the best choice I ever made.

It was a summer job and they all wanted me back. I plan on going back if the virus lifts by June.

Edit: spelling"
3996,"I had never had a job where I had to interact with people. Had just finished my Bachelor programme and would start a Master programme after the summer. The psychiatric clinic was looking for people who could work there during the summer and I had applied for it. There were three divisions that needed summer staff and the head of the psychosis division seemed oddly interested in me during the group interview. I said that I didn't have a preference regarding which division I would work in, so I suppose she picked me. 

The whole experience was surreal - not because of the patients (they were fine) but because of the staff. It was a very dysfunctional workplace, where everyone seemed to compete to seem the most exhausted. They treated the patients like criminals and had no respect for their privacy (e.g. brought me into the room of a sleeping patient I had never seen before). They didn't seem to want to help the patients. 

I was 21, but still a child with no understanding of what a real job would demand of me. I mostly just stared wide-eyed at the strange behaviour of the other staff and did what I was told. My supervisor seemed to decide quite early that I wasn't right for the job, but made no attempt to help me do it better. She also asked me if I had Asperger's and seemed to interpret my ""no"" as a ""yes"". 

I was definitively not qualified for the job - they should have picked someone who had some experience working with people - but 'm sure a qualified person would also be appaled at the workplace culture."
3997,"I now have a job that is harder to get than getting into Harvard. 0.9% of applicants make it vs. 4.8%. 

I wasn't even sure if I really wanted that job. I prepared for multiple rounds of interviews in different cities and weeks of training. And I went in with confidence. 

I met people who had applied for years. Even after completing training I wasn't sure if I wanted it. The others around me were so happy and cried because they finally made it. And I felt bad. 

But after a couple of months I knew I never wanted to do anything else in my life."
3998,Was an intern for >6 months and applied for an electrical lead position and got it. I was qualified on the education side but hardly on the experience side but landed it anyways. Still thankful for the manager who took a chance on me.
3999,"I had worked at grocery stores and retail establishments since I was 16, I had been looking on indeed for other jobs when I turned 18 and applied for a service advising position at a car dealership (I knew absolutely nothing about cars) on a whim thinking nothing could hurt. I ended up getting the job at a Lexus dealership. They took 3 months to teach me how to do everything and getting a basic understanding of car parts and their functions so that I could sell the repairs to people. 2 and a half years later I still work with cars lol"
4000,"I found a career. On paper, I didn't have the qualifications, just a general understanding of the principals. But my skillset and interests are a perfect match and I'm working on getting the certificates after 2 years on agency as ""interim"" and 3 years as an FTE."
4001,"So I applied for this cheese job lol. It was in a museum about cheese (I live in The Netherlands and cheese is a whole thing), and I basically had to show people around telling them about cheese. 

The interviewer lady asked me if I spoke German and French. 

I said no I only speak Dutch and English. 

She said ok. 

I still got the job, somehow. 

And turned it down, yeah!"
4002,"I debated taking it for weeks, terrified of making the wrong decision. Turns out, I was under qualified for a reason and it was miserable! I only lasted 4 months before I quit. Learned a lesson."
4003,"I wasn't wildly underqualified, but I have never met the full list of preferred qualifications for either post-undergraduate job I have had. However, preferred qualifications are simply a wishlist. Even the required qualifications are a wishlist if there are no applicants that meet every one of them.

The key is the be good enough to get an interview, and then show them your potential. I, for example, am a smart individual who learns quickly. Any qualifications I don't yet have, I can learn and learn efficiently. You have to talk up what you do well, and not fudge the fact that there are things you don't know. 

For my first job out of undergrad, they wanted someone with wetlab (DNA work) experience. I didn't have it, but I was confident enough that I could learn and they believed me. My other qualifications spoke for themselves, and lacking slightly in one category did not exclude me from their pool of applicants."
4004,"I don't think I've ever felt qualified for any job I've had.

For other jobs, that's been fine. I've learned on the way and figured things out as I go.

My current job though - depends on the day you ask me. Some days I'm making it through, and other days I massively regret taking this position and feel like I'm drowning. I took the job because I knew people that worked here who would help me out, but they've all left now, so I'm on my own and some days it's pretty awful.

I've been looking for a new job for a long time."
4005,I got my dream job when I thought I wouldn't be able to for another 10 years. I just went for it and it turns out I was what they were looking for. Passion goes a long way
4006,"it was beyond awful. i was 100% honest about my shortcomings during the interview (bad language skills, no references, no job since graduation), but they kept waving me off and saying ''it's no problem! everyone else will help you''. well, they were not happy to help, and by the time they found my replacement and ended my probationary period, there was a list of complaints 2 full pages long that killed my confidence and made me question everything. i've been out of work since. i was foolish enough to list that experience on my CV, and presumably a bad reference from them killed any job offers i got since. which i'm kind of grateful for, because i never again want the experience of the ''imposter syndrome'' turning out to be 100% true.

idk why this is at the bottom? i feel like it needs to be said more often that feeling incompetent is not always imposter syndrome - it can be true unreadiness for the role. i wish i had been told that, and how to spot the difference."
4007,"I really hated it, but needed money."
4008,Mind if I ask what field? Good on you! You sound like a great leader. Listening is a skill
4009,"Same for me! I'm in big 4 audit without an accounting degree (i studied economics/stats) ..the first months in the job I felt as a total dumb (no idea of how a trial balance worked, lol). I had a ""low profile/ultra humble"" attitude for 2 years, and learned a lot 

Now I'm a senior with very good grades, enjoying the job as well!"
4010,"Yesssss. Congrats! 
I read those same stats and decided I was going to ""apply like a man""! It's worked out."
4011,This is exactly why I asked this question :) thanks for sharing and I‚Äôm so glad you went for it. And so great that you love it! May I ask what you do?
4012,Yessss! 1000% I told this to my Ex a thousand times. Just go for it! Everyone embellishes their resume and unless you need an actual certification you can be taught a lot on the job. They want people who are good people. It‚Äôs not always the most skilled douchebag that gets the job.
4013,"Second this. I applied for a job that I was sure was way out of my league and managed to nail the interviews. I found that I was way more qualified than I thought, and the areas I felt deficient in were areas I was going to learn on the job anyway. I also learned that qualified does not equal omnipotent expert. I didn't need to know all the answers right now from memory. I just needed to know how to find the answers when I needed them."
4014,"This story makes me want to pursue my dream of animation.

I always worry that my lack of an art degree will work against me, but this makes me feel otherwise.

Thank you!"
4015,Agreed!
4016,I‚Äôm so glad! What field do you work in?
4017,Wow that‚Äôs a great story! Are you enjoying it? Is it something you ever thought of doing before that?
4018,How did you bring yourself up to speed those first few weeks if you felt you didn‚Äôt have the skills? Or did you have the rights skills all along?
4019,Ha that would require him having the self awareness to realise he wasn‚Äôt qualified ;)
4020,Sweet?
4021,It sounds like you were very qualified then!
4022,What do you do?!
4023,I went into digital marketing.
4024,Proud of you!
4025,"I'm grateful for all the articles/talks like these, really helped my awareness. Articles on how women negotiate vs men and make less over a career helped me push my boundaries during the wage negotiation phase, too."
4026,I'm a controls engineer working in chemical plant automation and optimization.
4027,Such good points! Congrats on the success!
4028,"Hey! I‚Äôve met people who recruit animators, 100% the portfolio matters more than anything else on the resume. Go for it!"
4029,Thank you! Consulting!
4030,"I grew up in some major railroad towns so I always was around locomotives but I never thought I‚Äôd be applicable to that job market. I‚Äôm thankful for the opportunity and I hope the job is enjoyable enough that I want to do it!! I dislike the aspect of moving a lot. I‚Äôm trying to find a partner and dating when you move so much is so so hard. I thought I had a guy who was invested in a future with me but he just doesn‚Äôt want to move so we stopped seeing each other. On one hand, the pay is so astronomical it‚Äôs amazing and on the other hand I worry about finding a compatible mate :("
4031,"Turns out I did have some of the skills, and I picked up on the rest pretty quickly."
4032,"Aww, thank you!"
4033,Thank you!!
4034,Midol extra strength
4035,"I ended up getting birth control and it helped a lot. Heating pads, midol or Advil

Edit: just thought of some yoga poses that could as well. Maybe child‚Äôs pose, fish pose, or variations of pigeon pose which opens up the hip. Of course don‚Äôt forget to breathe!"
4036,Heating pad.
4037,Try putting a hot water bottle on your lower back instead of your stomach.
4038,"Try using a menstrual cup along with some of the other tips in the thread. There‚Äôs a learning curve but it really lessened the pain for me and a lot of other women. there are a lot of chemicals in pads and tampons that cause painful, long, & heavy periods. I ordered a cheap one from amazon but make sure it‚Äôs still medical grade silicone. 

Or you can try organic pads and tampons."
4039,"Hot water bottle, warm drinks, rest & pain relief"
4040,"Advil Nighttime! It actually gives me a solid 8 hours of sleep, all blissfully pain free. I wish I knew about it earlier in life.

Staying warm and exercising (cardio, not just stretches) helps too. Spicy food makes things a lot more painful, so avoid that.

Sex helps A LOT leading up to or during the start of the period. Growing up, I was told by my extended Asian family that my cramps will get better once ""I'm married"", but it's not something I have heard of in Western society. But yeah, it works. Exercising a lot leading up to my period also helps, though less effective than the sex."
4041,Stick on heating pads--can't bring an electric one to work--and pamprin extra strength. There's varieties with or without caffeine and aspirin.
4042,I take ibuprofen and cocodamol
4043,Midol for sure ! Massage under your belly button for a few minutes with moderate pressure
4044,Hot bath with Epsom salts
4045,"I‚Äôve had the worst periods all my life. I got me Mirena and after 6 months it‚Äôs amazing. 
But I would take paracetamol and ibuprofen together and would switch between hot and cold packs. 
People dismiss cold packs but I urge you to try it."
4046,I have a clay pack that can be microwaved or frozen (to be hot pad or ice pack). I loveee it.
4047,I gave up dairy and my horrible cramps that I had from age 15-32 went away. I also get zero bloating before periods. One of the big reasons why saying no to cheese is easy.
4048,Chamomile Tea and Iron
4049,"Birth control, haven‚Äôt had a period in an entire year üòä"
4050,I find the 12 hour midol WAY better than the 4 hour ones.
4051,"Pain killers, heating pad, your fav ice cream/ bag of chips and some good Disney movies"
4052,"HYDRATE!!! I cannot stress that enough. The pain won‚Äôt go away immediately, but in the long run it‚Äôll help a lot.

Going for walks can help. Heating pads, caffeine, and of course Advil or neproxum sodium or midol."
4053,"My ways are stupid, but you asked!
1- I look for videos that makes me laugh alot. My stomach feels better when it's shaking as I laugh and I don't feel the pain anymore. Except the pain when you need to breath!
2-  I lie down and quick my feet up in the hair like I'm walking! But it also feels like the period flows more.
3- I repeatedly tap my stomach to the beat of some music. You'll get hungry though.
4- I won't say this one cause EHHHHHH but I KNOW everyone does it! So you're good!"
4054,don't drink anything cold during and days leading up to period. Use heating pad during the bad days. My great-grandma advised me the first one and I've noticed it makes a difference.
4055,"Eating more fiber helps more estrogen to be excreted via defecation because it reduces reabsorption of estrogen in the colon. And estrogen is what signals the cells in the endometrial lining to thicken. So, a thinner endometrium means less of the lining that needs to be shed. Also, you can try using BC to skip your periods all together."
4056,"I used to take either max strength ibuprofen or cyklokapron for years and even then, it was still extremely painful. Then, I tried some Chinese herbal medicine and surprisingly, it helped. It didn't completely get rid of the pain but it made it far milder."
4057,"Masturbate. It helps me a lot. Plus heating pads, sleep, and pot."
4058,"heating pillow, pain killers, hot chocolate and nice hot showers, also weirdly enough Masturbation works wonders"
4059,"Someone with PCOS and PMDD here! I have horrible periods, but I've found that using heating pads, doing gentle yoga or just some stretches, drinking lots of water and napping if I can."
4060,"I find exercising a little bit helps for me! Not just when your period comes though, but a few times a week and my period comes the pain feels less intense."
4061,Switch to reusable pads (if you‚Äôre using disposable pads or tampons) and try to get as close to a plant-based diet as you can (both of these worked for me).
4062,How is pot not on this list yet?? Smoking makes me feel 1000 times better!
4063,What does Midol do compared to just acetaminophen or ibuprofen?
4064,"I second and third this! I used to have to stay home from school, and as I got older, from work. I would vomit, sweat, and writhe in pain. It only stopped when I started the pill. It is nothing short of a blessing.

If you are against bc, it cannot take it, I wish I had more advice for you.l because, girl, I‚Äôve been there. I hope you find relief."
4065,"While getting married didn‚Äôt help me in that respect, lol, interestingly my cramps nearly disappeared after I had my first baby. A few of my friends have had a similar experience.

Before that I used to rely on prescription painkillers from my obgyn. A good cardio workout was very effective for me too, but I would still need the painkillers."
4066,"I‚Äôve been vegan for seven years... my cramps got WORSE when I first went vegan, better for a bit, but then the past year they‚Äôve been god awful. Twice this year, I‚Äôve had to go home from work due to cramps."
4067,How does using reusable pads help with painful periods?
4068,It has caffeine.
4069,From my understanding it has caffeine added to it. It made me not feel all fatigued due to the pain.
4070,After the first time I vomited I told my mom to take be the OB/GYN. That was the first time I had ever thrown up just from being in so much pain. And omg yes the writhing around like you‚Äôre getting exorcised! Some women don‚Äôt respond well to birth control but I don‚Äôt know of other options
4071,I'm very curious about this as well.
4072,"The toxins used to produce disposable tampons/pads may be a cause of the pain you‚Äôre experiencing.  This article doesn‚Äôt go as deep as I think it should but it‚Äôs what I could find:

4073,"When I started I had periods so painful I‚Äôd be almost blacking out (can‚Äôt hold a conversation, can‚Äôt drive, can‚Äôt think). My mom always said that having a kid helped her, but I‚Äôm childfree sooooo...no. Birth control has helped me with that, but I‚Äôve always had such odd side effects! It feels like a lose-lose for me :("
4074,May I ask your side effects? I get ovarian pain and that doesn‚Äôt get help with birth control
4075,"My mom had a heart attack at home when I was 18. Whenever EMS got there, I went outside crying my eyes out and screaming. My brother and grandmother were there, but we were all in shock and nobody was comforting each other. This woman riding by apparently saw us, stopped and gave me the biggest bear hug I have ever had in my life while I just cried my eyes out. She kept telling me it would be okay and she stayed with me until EMS came out and said they got my mom‚Äôs heart beating again. I had never met her before in my life, but she really helped me out that day and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forget her."
4076,"I was at this event about primate conservation and they drew 2 names for people to win tickets to see Jane Goodall speak the following day. My name along with a woman in her late 70's were picked and we got 3rd row seats next to each other. 

My lifelong pet lovebird had just died that week and so when I sat down at my seat, I was looking at photos of him. I didn't notice her coming up but she must have seen the photos because she immediately started talking to me about her 4 pet lovebirds. She had recently lost one of hers too. She comforted me so much with what she said and her empathizing with me about how special those birds are as pets. We hugged at the end of the night and went on our ways.

I didn't have contact with her, but about 5 years later I saw her working at a farmer's market and I somehow still remembered her name and she remembered me. We reconnected immediately and had a joyous reunion. In the summertime I only buy apples from her now. I hope I get to see her again this year."
4077,"I remember crying in a public bathroom and feeling awful, standing at the mirror trying to clean some of the makeup that had run, when a random woman I'd never met in my life asked me if I was okay and let me cry my eyes out while softly telling me encouraging things.

My favourite thing is that I've heard a ton of other ladies share similar stories. I love women.

Oh, and no, we didn't become friends."
4078,"It was during the entrance exam to a very prestigious, very coveted, very exclusive university in our country. There were almost eight thousand applicants, and around 50 places available. Tension was high, and the test itself was nightmarish. I was in a room with around 200 candidates, and we were all very stressed; a lot of people were 'sizing up the competition', and the atmosphere wasn't of the most pleasant. 

I was glancing around, trying to calm down and focus, when I accidentally met eyes with the girl whose desk was right next to mine, at about 50-70 cm. She was looking a little green, and I suppose I wasn't much better, because for a split second we watched each other, and I had the distinct feeling of being on the same boat, not competition, just another nervous girl. I guess she felt the same, because she reached out her hand toward me, and smiled. I took her hand, and for a bit, before the test started, we held hands, squeezing once in a while when we got a wave of nervousness. Right before starting, we let go, and I remember realising I had sweaty palms, but that she had them too, and for some reason that was the final push to calm down and focus. 

After the test we introduced ourselves and exchanged social medias, and for a while we kept in contact, but I can't really say we became friends."
4079,"I have endometriosis, which even in 2020, the medical community doesn‚Äôt take real seriously. So it‚Äôs been a struggle my whole adult life and it‚Äôs very isolating because even the educated people who know it exists and know it‚Äôs a serious disease don‚Äôt take you seriously. 

So I was going in for my second surgery, this time with a surgeon 400 miles away. I had an exam with him (keep in mind I had lived in constant pain for years) and he said my case was so severe he was scheduling surgery 8 days later. I was very scared but ELATED that maybe my life was gonna improve. 

And then my fucking insurance company wouldn‚Äôt approve the hospital that the surgery was scheduled at. So I call his office absolutely shattered. It was the first time anybody had cared about my case (and just me as a human being) and my stupid insurance wouldn‚Äôt cooperate. 

So the surgeons assistant says give her some time and she will work in this issue. Within hours she had called my insurance, changed the surgeons schedule, found a different hospital that my insurance likes better, and gotten everything pre-approved AND moved my surgery date up to 6 days later! I was in shock. 

So I got the surgery and literally woke up in less pain even after they shredded my insides. I had endometriosis everywhere gluing all my organs together. So even having all the surgical trauma was an improvement in my condition and I literally felt better waking out of the hospital than when I walked in. Modern medicine is an absolute miracle. 

So I went for a checkup after my surgery and I‚Äôm sitting in the waiting room and some lady just walks up and hugs me. I had no idea who she was! Turns out it was her ‚ù§Ô∏è We hugged for awhile and I cried. We didn‚Äôt become friends because I lived 400 miles away and there was the patient/provider relationship thing, but it was special for me. 

Her making a few phone calls just completely changed the course of my life."
4080,"I had a Scottish penpal for over 10 years. My favorite moment with her was when I was 15, and my super catholic ass messed up eating meat on a Friday in lent. My youth group friends just judged me. My atheist Scottish penpal actually helped me meal plan the rest of lent so it wouldn't happen again."
4081,"when I was in high school a friend of mine who went to the school killed herself, but it was a day during the week so I had to go to school the day after. I couldn't help it, so I went to the bathroom to hide in the stalls and cry, but when I went in there, there were 4 other girls all crying in there and I didn't know them, but we all cried together and reminisced good times with her. I haven't talked with any of them since, but it made that hard time a little easier"
4082,"During freshmen orientation week for my Uni, I was put with a group of strangers and there was this really pretty and shy girl. She‚Äôd laugh at jokes and participate in activities with the rest of us but outside of that she more listened then spoke. I remember during one of the speakers we had to go listen to, sort of like a motivational speaker, he was saying really cheesy stuff and I remember on a specifically cringe line she made a really snide comment under her breath. I over heard and it was one of those moments where you turn your head so fast with a shocked expression. I just look at her for two seconds and her face is sort of saying ‚Äúdid you hear that, oops‚Äù and I just bust out laughing that people started looking at me. I just didn‚Äôt expect that from her and since then we became good friends and we‚Äôre now juniors. Another wholesome moment was when me and the shy girl became friends with another girl in the group and found out they lived 3 doors down from each other but we‚Äôre such introverts that they never met bc they both didn‚Äôt like going outside. You meet some of your best friends in college so never forget to socialize while at school !"
4083,"All the time when I go clubbing and women are just nice to me. Always a drawn out drunk ""Omg I loooove your dress!"".ONE compliment from a drunk women is better than 10 compliment from 10 sober men any day."
4084,"I was crying at our student center in college because I was on the phone with my mom telling her I broke up with my boyfriend. I will never forget a girl walking by and handing me a snickers bar and saying she hoped I started feeling better. I had multiple people, guys and girls, do things like give me a thumbs up, etc. I must have really been a mess to get that kind of attention but it really made a difference to me. I could cry thinking about it now."
4085,"I was standing in line for the bathroom at a random bar in the next city over. Got chatting to the girl behind me, we add each other on Facebook. Fast forward about a year and a half and I get a text from my oldest brother asking how I know *girl's full name*. Turns out that's my brother's new gf! They have 2 kids together now üòä"
4086,"There's a chain restaurant in my city that I really loved, and my friends all knew it was my favorite so we would go there pretty frequently.

One time I went there with a friend and one of the waitresses was being mistreated by a customer. I didn't see what happened but she was visibly upset and the man was asked to leave. When I left I tipped my bill and she was so gracious about it. She said it had been a rough day, and I said, ""I know. You deserve it.""

A month or so later I went back and I saw her there, and she said she remembered me and asked how I'd been doing. Her smile was so wholesome and I still think about her and hope she's doing ok with this pandemic putting so many food service employees out of work."
4087,"I came upon the scene of a really horrific car versus pedestrian accident involving some teenagers where I performed CPR until the first responders arrived. I was a wreck. I knew the kid that I had tried to help was already gone but there was another woman there around my age (early 20s) gave me a hug, held my hand, and helped me clean myself up. We didn't become friends but I'll definitely never forget her or her kindness."
4088,"I was in a bathroom stall at the mall and was pregnant and noticed bright blood in my underwear. I just cried and couldn't contain myself and the woman in the next stall just gave me so many encouraging words not even knowing what I was going through. I finally told her what was happening and she assured me that I would be okay even though english was obviously difficult for her to understand. When I got out of the bathroom stall to wash my hands she stayed with me until I could compose myself and drive myself to the hospital. 
 We aren't friends today, I'll probably never see her again but I consider her a friend for eternity."
4089,"I was getting starbucks with a big group of friends, they got their drinks and went to sit, and I waited for mine. The barista gave me my drink and said ""hey I just wanted to tell you you are SO pretty!"".

I wanted to cry"
4090,Nothing major but I love to receive unexpected compliments by other women. In some of these occasions I was having a really hard day and having a stranger approach me to say something nice helped me to cheer up a little bit. Its actually something I'm trying to start doing myself (give random compliments to other fellow women) as I think it's a good habit to have.
4091,"My mom was this person. When I was maybe 7, We were at Christmas Mass but it was fairly empty. A young woman, maybe 25, was weeping alone in the pew in front of us. My mom got up, sat next to her and held and rocked her for the rest of the service. Turns out the girl's Best friend had died in a car accident."
4092,A woman helped me fold my bedsheets in a laundromat in Brooklyn. In silence. It was so intimate and lovely and no we did not become friends
4093,"I had an ex boyfriend cheat on me. While we were together, a different ex wrote to him about how he hurt her and cheated on her. After we broke up, his ex and I became good friends."
4094,"10 years ago I took my 6 year old out to dinner at Shakey‚Äôs Pizza. It‚Äôs a order and seat yourself pizza parlor with a salad bar. It was very busy and found a table that looked like it needed to be cleared off. So I kind of pushed everything to one side of the table and we sit and start eating. This woman approaches the table and said umm I wasn‚Äôt done here LOL omg I was so embarrassed. She was dining alone and didn‚Äôt leave any personal belongings. So I stand up and look around then I ask her. Can we join you? She looks around and says ok. We chat, she was really nice and we laughed about the situation. I find out she‚Äôs an actress(we live in LA) and does a lot of theater work. She invites me to one of her shows and we add each other on FB. We are still FB friends but I never did make it to one of her shows but she is still acting to this day. I don‚Äôt know how wholesome this is but I‚Äôll never forget it."
4095,"hmm when i was around 7,i was on my way from Thailand to the US and we had to make a stop in china,on my way to china, my ears started to ring and hurt like crazy, to the point i started crying. i was sitting in the middle between my dad who was on my right and a woman who was right beside the window. She offered my dad to let me sleep on her lap and lay down. my dad protested my she insisted, so the rest of the flight i was with her, we started to joke together and she showed me her dogs, i pretty much sat on her lap for the whole flight. She was chinese but me and my dad knew chinese so it was good. Now she's my stepmom! i love her as much as i love my real mom,though i am staying with my biological mom."
4096,"Had my 21st at a great karaoke bar, and another girl (in an adorable tiara) was also celebrating her 21st, but she was already mad drunk by the time me and my friends got there. Karaoke starts, and we both get called to the stage so everyone can sing happy birthday. We excitedly say hi to each other on stage, and while everyone is singing to us, she told me she loves me. It was funny and sweet. Happy very belated birthday, Chloe!


Edit: We didn't become friends unfortunately."
4097,"I crashed my bicycle into a bus.

Two amazing women helped me off the floor, told the bus driver, tied the ruins of my bike up for me, and walked with me to a nearby doctors surgery to get me checked out.

They were sisters, one of whom lived in the states and was going back the next day, and they spent a full hour of their last day together for ages looking after a complete stranger."
4098,[removed]
4099,"The girl that this guy two timed me with reached out, I dumped the guy and was online friends with that girl for awhile. Eventually I really wanted to move on and she reminded me of that bad memory so I stopped talking to her but she was nice for that while."
4100,"I went to a race circuit for free driving, with my Suzuki Swift Sport between the Lotus, Subarus and many, many BMWs. I was the only woman driving in our group, but noted many other women next to their boyfriends/husbands driving. 

One approached me and just told me she thought it was great what I was doing. I didn't know what to respond, mumbled something like gotta drive the car you have.. She just repeated her statement and left.

I've talked to some female racing drivers (which I'm not), but this was different. Maybe she liked to drive, but something kept her from doing it. But she still had the greatness and kindness to wish a stranger well. 

I drove home with ruined brakes, but deeply moved. Left me thinking a lot."
4101,"I once encountered [this sweet woman](https://laurakayprophet.wordpress.com/) while waiting for the bus.  Had no idea who she was before I spoke to her, but she was more than happy to strike up a conversation when I said hello. I learned a bit of her life, and about how she got her first duck and she was just so wonderfully her own person that I believed for the first time in a long time that life might work out okay if you just do what you love and be yourself.  

She was just so kind and lovely to talk to, and finding out later that she devotes everything she can spare to help others just made me a fan.  And helped restore my faith in humanity that day."
4102,This warms my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
4103,"As wonderful as it would have been if you had become friends, I find stories like these even nicer when you didn‚Äôt.

It shows that that woman was just happy to be there for you in that moment."
4104,"I‚Äôve had the same happen to me after a breakdown in a restaurant, a woman saw me go into the bathroom and followed me in. She talked to me until I came out of the stall and hugged me until I stopped crying. Hope I can help others as she did for me when I was seriously distressed"
4105,"This happened to me! I had a breakdown in a gas station bathroom with only two stalls on a road trip from Knoxville, TN to Charolette, NC. The breakdown was caused because I got a horrible stomach bug a few weeks before and still couldn‚Äôt keep anything down. On top of all that, I didn‚Äôt know what town we stopped in, but this woman was willing to listen to my problem. She then said she would pray for me in the most genuine way. It was a really memorable moment and I‚Äôm so glad she took the time out of her day to console young me in the bathroom."
4106,"I had to have a hysterectomy at 24 because of Endo. It's awful and you're right - the insurance company will jerk you around. My mom had recently died and I was really scared about surgery. Especially not having my mom there for such a ""womanly"" thing. When they were getting me ready for surgery and I'm laying there on the table, tears started rolling down my cheeks. The surgeon asked me if I was having doubts about the surgery and I told her no, I just really miss my mom. She held my hand and smiled at me and I'll never forget, she said ""I'll take her place and be your mom for now."" And then everything went dark and i woke up feeling significantly better. I don't know why but she filled me with such comfort when she held my hand and consoled me. I congratulate you on being an endo survivor. I hope you are doing much better!"
4107,"I just turned 21 in November, but one of my big conclusions since then is that I absolutely adore other drunk women! I got a ‚Äúoh my god your dress is soooooo pretty‚Äù around Christmas and it was the cutest thing ever."
4108,"Wow, small world"

4110,"Omg that melts my heart. There are some really good medical professionals out there that I am so thankful for.

I LOVE my online friends. We discord and game together all the time. But it's just so hard being inside all the time. I like going out with people, but they never seem to stick around long enough. I understand, we all got out of high school and have college to worry about and all, so I'm not bitter. Just a little lonely I guess."
4116,"Having a female best friend, or any best friend that‚Äôs not my SO.

I have sisters who are emotional supports for me, but when it comes to making friends I never thought I brought much to the table (not super social or interesting, but could be the self-doubt talking).

4143,"A place of my own.

I‚Äôm almost 25 and I‚Äôve lived all my life with my parents. They‚Äôre very helpful and I chip in on my part with like groceries. I never ask them for money or help. But I have two kids and an obviously failed relationship with their dad. I begged constantly for him to get us a place of our own so we wouldn‚Äôt go back and forth between our parents when we were together. Never happened. I can‚Äôt get a good enough job to move out on my own. 

I dream of just having my own home and decorating it however I want.... plus not having to worry about being a burden to my parents (even tho they always make it clear that I‚Äôm not). Plus, I could really use the space.

I just want to be in that place where you have a job, can pay all the bills and have a bit of money for fun stuff. Nothing crazy, just so I don't have to worry all the time."

4156,"I want to sincerely believe in something. I have never been able to have faith in anything. I‚Äôm hyper logical and skeptical, so I‚Äôve never been religious. Politics in the US are a disgrace, so I don‚Äôt have faith in our government. My family and friends always seem to let me down.

I‚Äôve got a great husband who earns great money so I don‚Äôt *have* to go to work, and right now with the virus and my kids at home, I‚Äôm lucky that I don‚Äôt have to worry about juggling their schooling/breaking up their fights with any kind of work. And for so long, I *couldn‚Äôt* work. I was mentally ill for a long time, and I kicked its ass, finding a job and earning my own money to take some pressure off my amazing husband for the first time in almost 20 years would be the absolute icing on the cake. Try as I might, I can‚Äôt seem to make myself take that final step towards doing so."
4163,"Moving to the countryside. 
I grew up in the country and we moved to the suburbs when I was 11. From the day I landed foot in our house in the suburbs, I began praying to return to the countryside. 
I'm now 37, married with three children. A huge part of that dream was to raise my kids and live with my own family in the country. I think about it every day, and it brings me to tears we aren't there yet. It almost happened twice, but both times fell through.

4186,"To be the lead singer of a rock band. I was shy when I was younger, and super self conscious in middle school as well. A friend told me I had a terrible voice when I was singing then, and it stuck with me.

Taking singing classes gave me confidence in this area, especially receiving a 4.0 for the one I took in college. However, I still haven't taken the steps to being in a band. My friend asked me to sing on his record, though, so I'm pretty stoked about that. And this COVID chaos has given me more time and energy to sing, so that has been fun."
4187,"To have a micro farm with various animals like pigs, goats, chickens, alpacas, donkey, etc."
4188,"I'm a lifelong writer. With Covid-19, I'm afraid I'm going to die without being published. I know that being published isn't the be-all, end-all of writing, but credits help in the fiction world lol."
4189,"I long for travel. I want to see new countries and take road trips. Not every day, mind you. I want two trips a year - one in the spring, one in the fall ideally - to somewhere neat. 10 days to two weeks per trip would be amazing. 

Alas, I have a job where I can't leave for anything longer than a week without SEVERE advanced notice, and my husband and I both have less than 2 weeks total annual vacation that gets used up pretty fast with short weekends to see our long-distance family members each year. Actually, my husband only gets 1 week paid leave. Grrr.

Honestly, I love my career field, but I HATE the ""you have to be available all the time or you're slacking"" attitude that's so pervasive. It's part the employer's fault, part the industry's fault, and a big part the American work culture's fault."
4190,Become a self published romance queen. Lol!
4191,"Sexual confidence- for me this will come from getting my body into a healthier state and being with someone I truly love. I‚Äôve always been self conscious of the extra pounds. In the last month I‚Äôve lost 10!! So proud :) when I get to my goal weight ya gal is going hard on the lingerie

It‚Äôs a fantasy now."
4200,"I just want to be pretty. 

I‚Äôve always been the ugly one in my group of friends. I know it‚Äôs superficial, but I just want someone to offer to buy my a drink on a night out, or to hold the door open for me when I go to the grocery store or just notice me when I‚Äôm out and about. I just want to feel wanted. 

Luckily though, I started working on myself! I‚Äôm getting surgery done on my jaw to make it fit better with the rest of my face, plus I‚Äôm getting braces soon, plus I‚Äôve started working out and lost a bit of weight. 

The biggest difference came from growing my hair out and changing how I dress though, once I started feeling more feminine, I started finding it easier to put more work into my appearance. I‚Äôm not there yet but I‚Äôm working on it."
4201,Growing roots but I‚Äôm having too much fun.
4202,"Firstly, buying a house on my own now that I've started my career.

Second, the ability to let go of and accept things. I've had anxiety issues since I was young where I always second guess everything I do or say, things other people say I overscrutinize and misinterpret in a way that makes me think they don't like me, etc. In general, I think it's a confidence problem. Not sure what caused me to have it, and I'm getting slowly better as I get older, but damn has it caused me untold amounts of pain."
4203,"Feeling content with what I do. I feel like i don‚Äôt do enough to further my career but my friends always tell me I‚Äôm doing crazy amounts of work. I don‚Äôt know I kinda have a sense of doom in the back of my head that I‚Äôll never get into grad school and then not having the chance to conduct research which is my biggest passion. I just hope one day I‚Äôll be able to breathe for a second and feel happy about my successes instead of always thinking about my next step, goal, activity, etc to keep feeling like I‚Äôm doing something to help people."

I can remember feeling that way as young as 11 or 12, when I really wanted to be with someone who GOT me and vice versa. I'm the kind of person who has a few really deep friendships instead of many surface-level friends, so I think that plays a part. 

I feel like I view it as part of my self-actualization."

Dream car since I watched transformers as a kid and i‚Äôm 20 now and seeing people around me afford cars like that kinda stings. Worked in a car dealership and when I got to drive one it was amazing and its kinda the one thing I never forget and hope I can do before I die is own one. Any one."

4231,A steady career that I‚Äôd be happy to commit to long term.

4239,"A real best friend. I missed out due to family (RBN/lots of family crap/having kids young/etc) and as I am almost 50 it doesn‚Äôt look like I am going to anytime soon. Never had a sleepover or done each other‚Äôs make up kind of thing. No one to really confide in. I pay a therapist a ton of money to help me work through it but it is hard to be behind the curve on this kind of thing. It makes me sad as I never got support from my mom (RBN- she was jealous of me and did everything she could to make me feel bad about myself) and never learned how to truly form friendships- I‚Äôve always ended up the one turned to, not the one who could do the turning- if that makes sense. So yeah, a bestie."
4240,"Going to college. 

Due to my parents not filing their taxes, I can‚Äôt seem to get any financial aid because for whatever reason being under the age of 24 means I‚Äôm a ‚Äúdependent‚Äù even though I live on my own, have my own health insurance, and work for a living.

I live in country where it is quite difficult to get job too, you have to degree or experience if you wanna go to a different field. ....

4247,"Confidence in my body. I didn't have any self esteem whatsoever until probably my mid 20's. Now I'm in my mid 30's and I have confidence about my career and I generally care a lot less what people think of me, but I can not seem to find any joy or even a neutral feeling towards my body. Any time I try to dress because i like a trend and not for the purpose of hiding my body, I end up feeling uncomfortable to the point that I can't enjoy what I'm out doing. Weight doesn't seem to have much to do with it. Right now, I'm at my 'settled' weight, where I tend to sit as my average. I've been significantly heavier and significantly skinnier, it doesn't really matter. I always have negative feelings about my body."

I'm in a friend group with 4-5 people but still I don't feel that they're very attached to me (like best friends) even though we've been hanging out for almost 2 years.

4323,For once being sure of something and actually loving the body I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm fairly young so I know that everything will be confusing but damn it feels like everyone else has atleast ONE thing they‚Äôre happily sure of.
4324,My college degree. I‚Äôve been struggling in school a bit.
4325,"To be at peace mentally and emotionally. 

I didn't have an outwardly shitty childhood, but I'm unpacking a lot of unhealthy and toxic traits and beliefs I grew up with and had ingrained into me as a kid, that gave me great turmoil and contributed to a lot of bullying as a kid. 

I come off as ok, well-adjusted and nice and smart, but inside I overthink. 

I'm stressed, high-strung, and can't relax. I feel like I have to always be on, play a character. 

I've longed for my mind to stop overthinking and for me to just feel at peace with who I am. That I don't have to put on for everyone. It hasn't happened yet, and every time I get close something in my mind flares back and reminds me of all the negative shit."
4326,"Finding my passion, my mom pretty much destroyed any dreams I had throughout middle and highschool. Now I do t have any. I can't find anything on care enough about to actualy work for. I hate where I am in life but don't even know what I want to do with it"
4327,A romantic well thought out date like a picnic or a carriage ride
4328,My damn degree. Life got pretty hard and I was barely scraping by but I‚Äôll only be a junior in the fall and I‚Äôm 24. This was not how I saw my life going.
4329,"Reading my whole bookshelf. I have a chance to do that this quarantine!

Also seeing a Dita von Teese show in person. I know it sounds a bit surface level but heh, it's the internet."
4330,Having my body look the way that I want to
4331,Female friendships
4332,"A husband and a child (a family of my own).

I had the opportunity with other men - who were abusive or not compatible. I chose to believe in a healthy family for myself and my future child... I just hope I can achieve it before I'm too old to have kids."
4333,"Financial independence. I want to work for fun, but I want to live off the interest on my investments, not struggle to pay my loans and rent every month.

I also wish I could come out to my family as polyamorous and have them accept the fact that my relationship has three people, not just two, and we all adore each other. I'm working up the courage to have that conversation, but I think they'll take it poorly, and I worry they'll try to take custody of our baby once we do come out. Which means that in the mean time, we have to find an excuse not to see family during the holidays"
4334,"I really really want to graduate from college. Thinking about walking across the stage at graduation makes me teary. I enrolled at 18, did two years, dropped out because I was basically an alcoholic, took three years off, grew a lot, was really poor, had some tough life lessons dealt my way, re-enrolled, changed my major, worked my ass off for a 4.0 then in my senior year (this fall) I was diagnosed with cancer and had to drop out. By the time I finish (if I get to go back) I‚Äôll be 27 and it‚Äôll have been nine years since I enrolled the first time."
4335,Being financially stable and motherhood
4336,Became a burlesque dancer :( Now I have the money for but don't have the time and energy
4337,"Buying my family house back, we sold it when we moved and I‚Äôve missed it ever since."
4338,"Becoming a registered nurse. Was supposed to start in the fall, but covid made my school cancel the entire cohort. Not even guaranteed a spot for the next semester.
Just a bump in the road. I know I have to stay as positive as I can be and I‚Äôll get there. Ugh!"
4339,"Being thirty, flirty and thriving"
4340,almost everything.
4341,Having babies.
4342,A baby.
4343,"Living in a city I truly love. I moved a lot as a kid, and now live with family to save money (albeit in a pretty nice place). But I find faults everywhere I've lived and criticize everything, when I'm not idealizing them all to hell."
4344,"To help women see their value by speaking from experience.  If I had not lived (and survived) and overcome a life filled with difficult circumstances, I would not believe my story.  Once I realized that how other people treat me does not define me, it was like I had a super power.  Ladies, you are amazing, beautiful, powerful and loving.  Make sure your heart and brain work together to live a life that believes it!"
4345,"Acceptance into medical school! One day, I will deserve it!"
4346,"Understanding myself and not letting outside opinions or beliefs determine who I am. I easily get caught up in what I think others want me to be or do. (whether it's family, friends, society, etc.) I get so caught up in their images of who I should be that I forget to step back and think about who I want myself to be."
4347,A child. We've been actively trying for 4 years with multiples miscarriages. We weren't super careful for 3 years before that.
4348,"To consistently play guitar and make my own music. I have ADHD and have tried different medications, but none worked for me. It's frustrating having such high expectations and aspirations, but lacking the energy and follow through each day to complete them."
4349,it‚Äôll sound stupid and childish but finding someone that will love me and find me beautiful. I‚Äôll be feeling lonely and my self-esteem is low lately. Idk why
4350,"Loving myself unconditionally. Knowing that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me, that I‚Äôm not broken, and that I don‚Äôt need to fix myself to be worth loving."
4351,"Oh god, this is embarrassing, but... I long for nothing more than to be brilliantly successful in my field. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm failing at life now or anything, I‚Äôm in one of the best PhD programs in the world for my research area, working with a famous and otherwise fantastic advisor....

I just wish I was so much more. I wish I wasn‚Äôt disabled - with the most shameful of disabilities, no less.  I wish I wasn‚Äôt chronically ill. I wish I could reach my imagined potential. I wish I was absolutely killing it.

This is probably going to get buried, but it felt helpful to write it out. Thank you for asking."
4352,"I want a group of friends, a group of people I can call family but I have to work with myself first. 
This whole quarantine thing made me realise I let my pass control my present to much. I got terrible social skills, afraid shitless of talking and I lose focus real fast."
4353,Some self-esteem would be great.
4354,To be an astronaut. I ended up with a biochem degree but no job prospects. So I sit here in a dead-end job and broken dreams.
4355,"You all are being serious.... I wanted to be an ice cream truck when I was a kid. Not drive the truck... I wanted to BE the truck. I wanted wheels and a dingledingle song and be full of ice cream and have all the kids want to come and and be happy. 

I remember being asked what I wanted to be when I grew up when I was little. At the time I wanted ice cream so thought... if I was an ice cream truck, I would have ice cream ALL THE TIME."
4356,"To know who I am.  

Sounds silly, but I don't really know.  I spent a long time raising my siblings, then moved in with my boyfriend and then became a wife and mother.  To be honest, I don't really know who I am outside of that."
4357,"Starting a family. It can be hard, seeing so many girls my age be married with children, but I'll be there in just a few years. Gotta be patient."
4358,"Not trying to sound badass, but I've always wanted to be a pro MMA fighter ever since I was a kid. I still think I have a chance, but me getting my ass kicked and my arm broken a few months ago was a bit of a setback."
4359,"Getting married and having a beautiful,  old house with a garden. I know marriage doesn't define a relationship, but it's something I've always dreampt of for myself. I'm almost 28 and it's hard watching girls younger than me achieve this or girls who have dated their partners for a lesser time."
4360,"Playing the violin. I've wanted one for years, but was raised extremely conservative, so I wasn't allowed to have a musical instrument. This new years, I vowed to get one this year. I got a lot of birthday money(March 28, so 2 days ago) and just ordered one today! It'll arrive sometime in April!"
4361,"Starts on yoga or pilates.

I tried yoga a year ago but turned out its not a beginner thing that I thought the bone on my thumb dislocated. It sore for a week."
4362,knowing who i am. i've been focusing on this for almost 7 months now.. only recently did i start scraping the surface. this is by far the hardest thing i've ever had to do. my mind is all cluttered and untangling the mess is difficult. i honestly feel crappy/loser for having to specifically focus on knowing who i am at 35. i feel so juvenile. so behind everyone else. people are normally done with this stage by age 18.
4363,Being held by a man... #foreveralone
4364,"having a group of girlfriends
maybe one of these days ill find a very own group of my own ‚òπÔ∏è"
4365,"Clear skin. 
It's at the point now where it's spotty and wrinkled."
4366,"Starting my production company. We're in the earliest of early stages, but the end goal is to have a full studio, offices, and an animation division."
4367,"Committing... to anything. I suffer from major depression and anxiety. Even on medication, I find it impossible to fully commit to anything. Not a job, not friends, not myself, not school, not family, not hobbies. I just want something to stick with me. It‚Äôs like everything in my life is just a phase. Things change so often I don‚Äôt even have a sense of normality, and it makes it very hard to know who I am or what‚Äôs even worth committing to. I know it probably has to do with subconscious fears, I just wish for once I wouldn‚Äôt quit/give up or I‚Äôd find something I didn‚Äôt quickly lose interest in."
4368,"Stability. I can't wait to not be working multiple jobs and being in school while my husband also works. We don't have to live paycheck to paycheck, for which I am so grateful, but I can't wait for a time when we don't have to constantly fight to hold the ground we have."
4369,Having equality in society to a man.
4370,"Literally everything. School, license, inner peace, mental stability, financial stability... literally everything."
4371,To be a healthy weight according to the BMI scale. I have never been that weight.
4372,"Career wise - having senior level programming skills. I'm in the starting stages and it can be a bit painful at times seeing others solve things quicker even though I'm aware they did it for a much longer period of time than me. 

Family - marriage, kids, parent bonding. I'm in a committed relationship but also in the early stages but I've always had this as a future goal. House is kind of 50/50, and its mostly due to me being concerned about the distance from other places I like to be nearby. 

Growing my hair longer than shoulder length. I have kinky type hair so I'm learning a lot of new things about how to treat my hair right, and I'd like to grow it longer because my family always couldn't deal with my being thick and complaining about styling it. I just want something different rather than the typical hair perming, straightening, and cutting it to not care for it."
4373,Just get REALLY good at something like hobby wise. I feel like almost everyone I know has something extra in their life that they are just really damn good at and I‚Äôve started so many hobbies and projects that I never finish because I‚Äôm tired after work and don‚Äôt want to do mentally laborious tasks on the weekends. I also want to get known for something like a good gift giver or great sock collection or even just really nice hair.
4374,"A successful, long-term relationship where I am genuinely in love, happy, and fulfilled."
4375,A loving relationship. Tbh at this point in my life I saw myself as having a husband and a baby. Still waiting.
4376,"Financial stability, having my own place, getting a degree, and being content with myself. Because I am young, I view everything as a transitional point in my life. I just want to be where I want to be already, but it takes a lot of time to get there."
4377,"Finding a best friend. Sounds crazy. But I have a boyfriend who I am in love with, and live with. He has guy friends over a lot and i am just missing that woman to woman bonding. I used to have a close best friend but we had a falling out. Haven‚Äôt had a connection as strong since. It takes a toll on me almost everyday to feel without a close friend."
4378,"Getting married to the Love of my Life. I mean, I‚Äôm cute (and in my mid twenties), I‚Äôm fun, I‚Äôm brilliant and ambitious and I‚Äôve worked hard af to be emotionally and physically healthy and self aware. I know I‚Äôm not clingy or deserate.

It‚Äôs just... I‚Äôve really longed to love and be loved by someone who‚Äôs a great fit for my personality and life goals. Coming home to someone I‚Äôm crazy about would be a dream. I hope I get to live it one day. Soon."
4379,My grad degree
4380,"Career goal. I don't need anything big, hardly even a career, I just want a job I like and an proud of."
4381,"Late last year I accepted I'm lesbian, and the whole times I've been wanting to be held and loved by a woman, I want to hold a woman and tell her she is beautiful, and be with her on a deep level.

But it's hard, I don't know how to act around women in a romantic way, most women are straight too, and society just isnt set up to make it something that even feels... aachievable to me."
4382,Total freedom from irrational anxiety
4383,For me the thing that helped the most was finding the right community. The people and social aspect is what got me to show up - I love my instructors and my little workout circle. It makes it easier to be accountable when someone else is depending on you to show up.
4384,"The best workout is the one you love. Hiking, roller skating, kayaking, running, weight lifting...  If you don't love it, you won't do it!  I did a C25K program and fell in love with running. Every week I felt like a made a huge accomplishment.  r/C25K was super supportive too and helped me stick with it"
4385,Just do it for 2-6 weeks no matter what. It will soon become a habit and your body will crave it. It will get so much easier and even fun to do it from then. I promise. As long as you do something that you find fun. ‚ÄúThe best workout is the one you‚Äôll keep doing.‚Äù
4386,"I‚Äôm with you. The only form of exercise I like is dance. I hate literally everything else. But I‚Äôm getting past the age of being able to go to dance class, so I fear I‚Äôll never exercise again after that lol."
4387,"I'm a personal trainer, and it's still hard for me. I can train people all day, then go home and sit in the couch. I look athletic so I can get away with it longer than I should. I've found that joining a small group keeps me coming back and accountable.  If I miss a workout u usually get a sarcastic text. Also, finding small goals. Right now I'm trying to learn to do a handstand.  Find something or someone that inspires you to keep going."
4388,"I started working out regularly in the AM because I have anxiety and my therapist suggested it.

Starting off the day with a run/lifting weights is a really good way to combat anxiety. That helped push me to do it. Now I feel crappy if I dont!"
4389,"A trick that really worked for me to remember the feeling after exercise, the adrenaline(dopamine?). So everytime after a gym session I‚Äôd say to myself, ‚ÄúOk remember this feeling.‚Äù So whenever I felt lazy about exercising I‚Äôd try and recall how good it felt so effectively it kind pavloved me like a lab rat."
4390,"I just got consistent with working out at least 3x per week until everything was shut down. Now I try to keep it up, but I find it really difficult to work out from home, so I mainly go jogging (definitely not my favourite work out)

I want this quarantine to end so badly"
4391,"Find something that is exercise, but doesn't feel like exercise. The big one for me was football (soccer) because it was fun to do and the team aspect meant you were letting people down if you weren't consistent. After being banned from rugby and javelin I could not stick to exercise at all, but finding a team sport really did help."
4392,"I thought my answer to this post's question was ""nothing,"" but, ah, here it is."
4393,I aim for toned abs as well üò• hard to be committed
4394,"I can‚Äôt even start it, honestly."
4395,"Once I stopped doing exercise for ""health"" or ""weight loss"" (and all that diet culture BS), it suddenly became fun!!  I love running now!  I may not run as far (don't go above nine miles at a time), but I go more frequently and it's always fun - even during the actual run."
4396,"I‚Äôve only just started to genuinely enjoy exercise in the past couple of months but now I can‚Äôt even go to my classes anymore because of bloody corona. 

The key is to find a type of exercise you enjoy. This took years of chopping and changing for me but it definitely pays off once you strike gold."
4397,"Desperately trying to be vulnerable enough to fall in love. 
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll ever happen for me."
4398,"I feel this. I'm 25  and have never dated and I'm a little worried I'm broken. I have so much love inside and I just want to share it with someone special.

Edit: Thank you everyone so much who's responded. It's so reassuring to know I'm not alone, and that it's not too late for me."
4399,"Same.

Everyone just says ‚Äúwait for it‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôll happen in time‚Äù, ‚Äúwhen the right person comes you won‚Äôt even care‚Äù... but dude I‚Äôm 28 and I‚Äôm SOOOO sick of being ‚Äúyour only single friend.‚Äù"
4400,I feel this. I just want to be loved
4401,"I thought I'd never fall in love, and I was even kind of okay with it (because honestly I thought I'd have to live alone forever and I wanted to be at peace with the idea), until I found someone who just clicked for me. I started something new, and he was part of it, and everything just came together when I wasn't even expecting in. So hang in there."
4402,Same here.
4403,"Falling in love is so special, I hope that when you do it is with the right person. Wait for it, it really is a beautiful thing. There is nothing wrong with you. Really the person that falls for you and you for them is because you accept them for who they are and they accept you for who you are."
4404,"I keep on doing this thing where i really like someome and when we start going out, all those feelings that I had just aren't there anymore. I need to fix that but i dont know how"
4405,"I‚Äôm married but have about 6-7 friends from high school that are really close. I used to think they were setting their standards too high because now at 31 they are all single, but after hearing their stories, dating in the modern era is just so unbelievably hard. It‚Äôs so easy for one person or the other to drop you and move on to the next if the sparks aren‚Äôt flying from second one or they think they can do the tiniest bit better.

Anyway, what I meant to say is that my friends are incredible women: beautiful, funny, socially capable, educated, and successful in their careers. Nothing wrong with them besides the little quirks that we all have, and I‚Äôm willing to bet a million bucks that there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with you."
4406,"Me too. I just want to fall in love in a big city, is that too much to ask for, sigh."
4407,Oh I hear you! I‚Äôm 26 and am starting to wonder if I‚Äôm broken. I haven‚Äôt really had much of an opportunity to date or anything either and where I‚Äôm from people get married at 18 or 19 so it makes it worse. So now I‚Äôm just scared it will never happen.
4408,"Same. I'm fine being alone but I've spent the majority of my life alone so finding that right person would be nice. I've watched people around me move onto the next phases in life, marriage, children, houses, etc while I'm still living with my parents (I'm not ashamed but at nearly 30 it's not where I thought I would be) and single as a pringle lol"
4409,"SAME. God, the loneliness is starting to hurt now"
4410,To love and be loved.
4411,What do you think that looks like?  Falling in love.
4412,"I feel the exact same way, sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôve lost the capacity to feel things. I‚Äôm hoping that by putting a pause on my dating life I‚Äôll meet someone out of the blue..."
4413,"I thought I'd never fall in love, and I was even kind of okay with it (because honestly I thought I'd have to live alone forever and I wanted to be at peace with the idea), until I found someone who just clicked for me. I started something new, and he was part of it, and everything just came together when I wasn't even expecting in. So hang in there."
4414,... Same but following various subreddits it seems like everyone has their own moment to find their path as long as they keep trying
4415,"yikes, too real for quarantined me"
4416,oof me
4417,I don‚Äôt know how people do it. Here‚Äôs hoping for you find it. I hope I do too.
4418,"I lucked into this when I found a hobby I loved. My husband got me into cars. And at a car meet I jokingly made conversation with a dude who had a cast on, as did I at that point. Fast forward about 6 years and the four of us (he got married) and another pair we met through cars are nearly inseparable. To the point that they drove over an hour away, and took two days off to come to my father's funeral even though they'd never met him. He was sick for a long time, and my greatest fear was that he'd have no one but me. And they came and sat through the whole long catholic thing. They'll forever be family to me. 

Anyway. Tldr. A hobby. One that you love. Will find you people you love."
4419,I think this is my new goal. I want a group of women to travel with and be friends with.
4420,I long for this so much. I was reading braving the wilderness by brene brown. She talks about belonging and how it comes from within often. But having a group to stand with and be with sounds so nice.
4421,You‚Äôre looking for your tribe!
4422,Yer. My best friend moved across the country 2 1/2yrs ago. I‚Äôve been lonely ever since
4423,I‚Äôve wanted this exactly. Still looking
4424,A sense of belonging and community. I desire this so much too. I envy people who have a tight knit group of friends.
4425,"yeahhh, same. ive given up though."
4426,"I couldn‚Äôt agree more, why is it so hard to find?!"
4427,"After a nice I am in the same boat. I moved to a cultural climate that's in direct conflict with my personality so finding a tribe is going to be a huge challenge here. I'm working in it with some success but this quarantine took the wind out of the sails. 

I'm still on the hunt though."
4428,This is my goal too. I want to find my people
4429,"I moved to a new state and I had trouble making new friends. It took so much effort... 

I met my new friends through D&D and now we meet Io every Monday (well, not right now, lol). I also met two incredible friends through bumble BFF and I catch up with them at least once a week (I have known them for about 3 months) .

I think that we are all adults and recognise how much effort goes into establishing a friendship, so everyone makes an effort to check up on each other and offer a plan. I always felt clingy when I was the one always asking to hang out, but It's really good for my soul to know that I have two other people that are investing in building a friendship."
4430,"It changes as you get older. Communication is the biggest part. Communicate with them about how you want to be treated or if you need them to text or call at certain times. I have my friend groups tiered so that I can manage my expectations. You'll have the friends that will drive you to the airport or talk you through a panic attack, those are the friends to make sure you contact regularly. The rest, if you can get them together once a month or more for a game night, you're doing well. All of those types of friends offer important things in your life. Be open and the people best suited to close friendship will appear. :)"
4431,"I also want a best friend. What state do you live in? I'm in Missouri. If you're far away, we could be online best friends?"
4432,Honestly I wanted one for a very long time and then this year during my second semester of college I sat at a table with this girl that had a Pok√©mon back pack. I complimented her on it and then we started talking a lot now I couldn‚Äôt imagine my life with out her. Honestly just find hobbies you like and get into groups and I know you‚Äôll find someone.
4433,"I have female friends. With time, we have distanced away. I want a best friend too or a group of tight knit girlfriends. Sucks being an introvert with different tastes."
4434,"I never thought I'd find mine, but oh my goodness it was worth waiting. She has the most precious kids that I adore. Of course now that I have my BFF I'm moving abroad and it hurts that I'll leave her but she'll have a piece of my heart always."
4435,I feel you girl. I had soooo many good friends in high school. In college... not so many lol. Now I‚Äôm in a new town with my fianc√© and I have no friends at all. I hope I can find a friend soon!
4436,"Came here to say this. I used to have best friends back at high school, but they didn't lasted throughout college and I didn't find any new friends there. It makes me sad to think I might go through big life changes like buying a house, having a baby and marrying without a female best friend."
4437,Same. My friendships are always like love triangles in that whoever I think it's most amazing thinks someone else is most amazing
4438,"Me too, I could‚Äôve written this!"
4439,Where are you located? We could be friends lol.
4440,This is so cute I love it
4441,And here I am cutting ties with my best friend for a still unknown amount of time because I fell in love and can‚Äôt tell him...
4442,heyooooo! Lol me too! I‚Äôd recommend the song ‚ÄúPiece of Mind‚Äù by kehlani idk it rly gets me in my feels but also uplifts me!
4443,"Holy shit, go you."
4444,"Rooting for you!!! Amazing job so far, that's a lot of work!"
4445,"I have one work in progress, three solid ideas I‚Äôve worked on, and now I started another book. It‚Äôs a fantasy and I‚Äôm doing all the details this time. I‚Äôm working on character profiles and world building and creating a reference binder so I‚Äôm hoping this one is it. I‚Äôm a writer (by career too) and I know there‚Äôs a novel in me lol"
4446,"When it's ready, let me know where I can find it. Avid reader here ü•∞ good luck!"
4447,"I hope you can do it this year.

Are you on a lockdown too? Its a great time to do it. I hope you dont have writer's block now"
4448,"Congrats. You should look into self publishing too, sometimes you can make even more money that way cause you don't have to share with the agent, published and all the other people involved."
4449,Same. 47 years old now and still working on that one.
4450," Check out bodyposipanda on Instagram. She's awesome. She posted a thing once that I often think of. ""You do not owe the world pretty. You do not owe the world thin. You do not owe the world thick. You do not owe the world a body that you have to sacrifice your mental health for."" 

No one lives in it but you! And it gets you up and helps you do and accomplish things everyday. Appreciate it!"
4451,I was about to comment this!
4452,Ooof. Right there with you.
4453,"Yeah that would be nice, I agree"
4454,"This. Really, it‚Äôs all I want. After a majorly abusive relationship, I don‚Äôt feel safe anymore, anywhere and it sucks."
4455,Yes. Safe.
4456,Man this is getting too relatable
4457,"Depression is the worst. It‚Äôs hard to manage, hard to diagnose, and perhaps the worst thing is sometimes you don‚Äôt even know how bad you have it because...well...the depression becomes the norm. I was once pretty depressed. I would say I‚Äôm about 80% back to normal. What did it take? Moving back w/parents to remove the number one stressor...rent/$/saving. I kept my job so that made a big difference. Step two was starting to get some confidence back. See you can‚Äôt regain your normal character/confidence when you‚Äôre mind is so preoccupied/ distracted with stressors. Identify the number one and start taking steps to eliminate it/or whatever you can do to mitigate it. I worked on a long term project (3-4 months of work but like 6 months of planning/research). Anyway once I completed that project some of my mojo/confidence  came back. Then I started to transition into what I call momentum/snowball stage. Basically keep doing things that are good for my long term well being. Eat right, exercise. It‚Äôs been two years now and I‚Äôm ready to move out and start grabbing life by the effing horns again. FU depression.

Edit: but yeah sadly no easy cure/medication."
4458,That took me ten years but it was so worth it in the end. Just do some little things to make it feel like home until you can replace your stuff with nicer stuff. Vinyl clings for the closets and nicely framed artwork helped me a lot.
4459,Same
4460,Right there with you.
4461,I feel this. I'm in the middle of buying a house now. I hope they let me move in next month!
4462,Same! I had to back out of an apartment agreement right before I moved in bc of this virus..kinda annoying but I‚Äôm glad I did because I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pay them rent now anyway üòù
4463,Same here
4464,I relate to that so hard!
4465,This! So much this!
4466,I'm in the same boat!!
4467,I lost my job in December and that put my house hunting on hold and now COVID has pushed that back even further and it‚Äôll probably take me longer to get a job now.
4468,The same too. I definitely miss having my own place (had this lovely experience during my university days) that i can wake up to.
4469,"this is such a beautiful goal. I love it. AND it is absolutely something you will attain, step by step."
4470,"Damn, i felt that"
4471,Was gonna write this...already here
4472,"Ayy I feel you. I don‚Äôt have IBS, but the one thing I want most is also related to disability / chronic illness. Shit sucks."
4473,"I feel ya - I'm in the same boat. Coronavirus and people posting online about how they love their ""quarantine partners"" (meaning their husband/kids) makes me so depressed about my life..."
4474,Right there with you!
4475,"Ugh, I feel that. I don‚Äôt have chronic pain but I have a chronic illness that causes intense fatigue. 

That really really sucks about the doctors not taking it seriously. :( Having competent doctors that take you seriously is so important. I sincerely wish you the best of luck."
4476,I hope you can get one soon! Is it a combo of money and childcare keeping you from getting your own place?
4477,Came here to say this. I‚Äôm so envious of women who can orgasm during sex üò©
4478,"Are you able to do so with masturbation? I had to learn what I liked on my own first for sure, and even that took several years. Now I have it down to an art and any potential previous partners could be easily guided. Hubby has it down to an art now too- and I never thought I‚Äôd get there. I was 25 when I had my first one."
4479,"I‚Äôll talk books all day! PM me, tell me what genre is your favorite."
4480,"Is it the, *""what if I don't""* thought? That's the main one that holds me back. I never win the What If Game."
4481,Where do you see yourself living? There's so many nice places in Europe that it's difficult to choose!
4482,"Hey, that‚Äôs awesome. Smiling is so important, and if you were more confident you‚Äôd do it more! I hope you are able to fix ya teeth soon!"
4483,I can relate to this in it's entirety. I also need dental work and had planned to start on it but then the virus hit and put a halt to that. I also wish I could find a full time job that I enjoy and can move up in. There's little to no progression in my current job and the money isn't worth staying in a no progression job. I just recently got my job too last year and the lady I replaced worked their for 35 years. Definitely not the plan for me.
4484,...puppies?
4485,"First step, believe in yourself. You are the one thing you can control. Be kind to yourself and give yourself permission to look at all of the things you do well, even simple little things like making a decent dinner, and take a moment to think ""I did that and I did it well."" There have been studies that have proven that talking about yourself positively even if it feels silly actually changes our thought patterns. And if you wouldn't say it about your best friend (or whatever you love the most) then don't say it about yourself."
4486,Believe in yourself!   It‚Äôs the best investment you will ever make!   I‚Äôm rooting for you!   Please be Awesome!
4487,Right? Moving into my own apartment would be nice but it's way too expensive to live alone out here!
4488,awwww. What's the hangup?
4489,Same. üíñ
4490,OK that sounds like a LOT but if you break those apart into steps...that's all actually quite reasonable. And a good dream!
4491,This. ‚ù§Ô∏è. * giving you magical energy to manifest this *
4492,"Inner peace. I'm on my way, and still have a way to go. We'll get there."
4493,"The clich√© is that money doesn't buy happiness, but I think we'd all be happier financially stable."
4494,"How about being just like...80% sure of where you want to live for the next 5 years? That's plenty long enough to justify a home, tbh."
4495,\*hugs\*
4496,That's really cool! I've always wished I could sing :(
4497,If you're not there already a member you should go to the Make Up Addiction subreddit. Not because you need make-up but because it's amazing how good it can make you feel to change up a few things and make-up can definitely add to your confidence in being feminine.
4498,"Eesh, I understand that pressure. I'm well into my career now but am still always feeling like I'm behind and need to work harder to catch up to...my own expectations, I think."
4499,"Girl.  Her issues with you are just that. HERS. Love her like you have her approval.  Love her before you can‚Äôt.  Love her because she has a love for you she cannot deny or ignore. Outwardly, she can disapprove but inwardly she can never deny the feeling of carrying you in her body and welcoming you into the world with open arms.  

I sought my mother‚Äôs approval for too many years.  When I was little - and grown - her line was ‚Äú I don‚Äôt need you. I don‚Äôt need anybody‚Äù.  I came to understand it was a defense Mechanism because one of her greatest fears was to be alone. When she was placed into hospice five years ago almost to the day, I made a decision to let all our troubles pass with her.  I spent 10 days and nights by her side.  I purposely fell asleep holding her hand every night.  I talked to her. I asked for forgiveness. I gave her mine.  I told her I wasn‚Äôt going to let her die alone.  And I didn‚Äôt and I am so glad.  It gave me the ability to grieve with my kids from a genuine place and allows me to remember her with love. I always tell my kids I wish I would have come to this place sooner so that both of our lives would have been richer.  Approve of her; it may show her a pathway back to the undeniable love every mother has for their child until the end of time.  Bless you!"
4500,I feel this.
4501,"If it helps, you don‚Äôt really need to know Japanese to get by in Japan."
4502,"Fair. Though, wrong sub. But yeah...that's a good goal."
4503,Best wishes!
4504,Seriously. Me too.
4505,Are you talking bushcraft methods? Bowfire may be your best option.
4506,Totally natural feeling to have. If your body is equipped to make a baby why would you not want to make one? It is the greatest super power humans can have. I pray you will be able to conceive with your huaband.
4507,"Is common law a thing where you are? Or getting certain legal documents firmed up that would function the same way as marriage? I know a lot of people who avoid marriage solely for tax reasons (incomes are the same so they take on a penalty in the US), so if there's something like that, you can still draft POA, other docs and still have your commitment ceremony or something. Just a thought. Hope you have a healthy delivery."
4508,Have you been in love with anyone?
4509,I'm 22
4510,Same!
4511,"This. 100% this. When you look forward to seeing the other people at the gym it makes it easier to go. And when you look forward to going then you go more. Then you start to crave it. 

I was struggling to find exercise I liked until I fell in love with exercising in someone else‚Äôs garage, then they moved. I failed hard at the next 4 gyms I tried. Then I found another community that is perfect for me. I‚Äôve quadrupled my attendance in 4 months. I am missing it so bad right now, but I know they‚Äôll be there for me when we can go back."
4512,"Did you ever feel self conscious starting out? If so, how did you get over that? I keep getting close but then backing out."
4513,"I did C25K,C210k, C213.1 and loved them all! They are really great at reigning in my crazy. I tend to over train and they keep me from hurting myself. Its a personality flaw. I can‚Äôt ever do anything a little. I have to do it to the extreme."
4514,"Good for you! Love the roller skating. I started roller derby a few years ago and could not stop! I still look forward to practice days and if I have to miss, it messes with me for days. This social isolation situation has been rough"
4515,And if you can't afford your favourite form of exercise treat it like paying bills and just fucking DOOOO IT!
4516,"This never happened for me. I worked out consistently for almost 2 years. I never craved it and I never felt the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù I‚Äôve heard others talk about. I hated every minute of it. Not experiencing these things has always made me wonder if I‚Äôm normal. 

I did lose a ton of weight though. But then I gained it back..."
4517,This was totally me. Met more hubby and it was weird how not weird it was. There will be sometime it is just totally natural with even if it‚Äôs not normally natural for you
4518,I know this feeling. Where do you even start? Opening up is hard and there is a choice between heartbreak (you have not been loved) or being alone (you will not be loved).
4519,Wow.. you took the words right out of my mouth! I‚Äôm turning 26 in about a month though üòï
4520,"31 and reporting in, same here. I'm in therapy and it's something we talk about a lot. The tough part is that the solution is apparently to date a lot and I'm trying to decide if falling in love is really worth forcing myself to do something that I actively hate doing."
4521,I‚Äôm 26. It‚Äôs actually kind of joke in my old friend group that I‚Äôll be alone forever. They all think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm super sexual and can‚Äôt commit to anyone. I‚Äôm not and have not and could not. Nobody sees that though and I‚Äôve never really admitted it.
4522,"I thought I was the same, never made it past a 3rd date, no relationships, until I met my ex last year when I was 24 and fell in love. It didn't work out with us but at least I know I'm not broken now. There's hope for you too"
4523,"Random personal story about my husband. He always liked girls/women from when he was 13+ but no one ever liked him back. 

We were friends forever, but didn‚Äôt start dating (long distance) until I was 25 and he was 27.5. We decided to be together in the same place, so I decided to move, because my career was at a dead end and I wanted a change of scenery in general. We got married when I was 26.5 and he had just turned 29. 

I wasn‚Äôt his first kiss, but was his first everything else. He wasn‚Äôt mine though, I had steadily dated since 17/18. 

Anyway, don‚Äôt lose hope. He had and said he thought he‚Äôd live his life alone and then, poof, stuff just happened. We‚Äôve been married for 6 years, 7 years this summer and have an almost 3 year old.

It might not happen when you want it to, but it can definitely happen."
4524,you are me and I am you and we are not alone :')
4525,"feels good to know I'm not alone in my situation Lol. Older sister started dating when she was 15/16 and has been in a long relationship for the last 8 years at least, off and on, it will be 12 years. Meanwhile I never even legit dated. I think I had dates before but I didn't know they were dates until years later."
4526,I'm 24 and this is how I feel too üòï except I HAVE fallen in love... I just can't be with the person I'm in love with üòì
4527,"I think ""wait for it"" is bad advise. I extending your social circle a bit with your interests can help you be more likely find love. It's not just a passive sit around and wait for something to happen. Literally get out there and do stuff. Be around different/new people."
4528,Therapy could help you. But it sounds to me that looking up the avoidant attachment styles could be helpful.
4529,[deleted]
4530,It‚Äôs been temporarily moved to my back burner of priorities during lockdown lol
4531,"Are you taking applicants for women to travel with and be be friends with

Edit: sooo were all friends now right? Should I start a group chat"
4532,"Same, a clique is always so comfortable to be in."
4533,"Wild women expeditions, check it out, that company and the women who travel with them are awesome!"
4534,I agree!! Wish it was easy to find a unit
4535,"If you‚Äôre up for it, join a roller derby league. I found such an amazing group of  women to play a sport with and also to hang out with. It is all about camaraderie and uplifting each other while training together. I always longed to have a group of women to be friends with and I found it here."
4536,"Yep. That's exactly what I'm looking for.

My family was never much of a family, and I've never really had a friend group either. I really want to experience that."
4537,Thank you so much. That's super insightful!!
4538,Aww I‚Äôd love nothing more! üòä  Briefly perused your profile and we have a couple things in common! PMing you..
4539,Yeah absolutely  I've felt the same for a while too I never thought I could connect with anyone really met this girl recently we have heaps in common and talk all the time. Were both introverted and gamers. I agree  that finding groups and hobbies are the best way to meet people.
4540,Everyone has distancing issues right now. Video chat with those old pals...
4541,Introverts make the best friends! In my opinion they are the best at active listening
4542,"I moved far away from my bestie too. I still feel bad about it sometimes but it makes the times we are together so much more precious. We take vacations together and do 2+ hour phone calls so don't worry, you two can keep it up!"
4543,"North Dakota! So nowhere exciting lol. How about you? And heck yeah!
Edit: Judging from your recent post history, I can guess where haha. But that‚Äôs awesome, how do you like it there (in general, as I‚Äôm sure the pandemic has affected things like so many other places)?"
4544,sending good vibes x
4545,But everyone has to see it :(
4546,Oh hey I needed this so bad today
4547,That‚Äôs comforting to hear. Thank you!
4548,"I am too!  Supposed to close on the 16th, but worried they‚Äôll revoke financing because of the industry I work in. Good luck to you!"
4549,People actually like being stuck with their kids? I feel incredibly fortunate that my friends with kids from all parts of my life are very honest about how stressful it is to have their kids at home constantly. I am also glad I don‚Äôt have them right now.
4550,"Well my city has a really low pay rate despite the rise of taxes and cost of living. My income by itself just isn't enough unfortunately. Usually people that live on their own here need a roommate (or a SO ) to split the costs, receive housing (Section 8) or other government help like TANF, or just have a decent job thanks to a college degree (which I am working on!)

&#x200B;

This sounds really stupid to say, but its embarrassing how all my tinder/bumble dates assume I live on my own since I'm already in my mid 20's with two kids. Makes me feel like I really should be on my own by now."
4551,You ladies are all so sweet it's giving me cavities. <3
4552,"Probably. I'm afraid that if I fail, I will be told ""I told you so.""


I'm more afraid of disappointing my mom than anything or anyone else though. She already thinks I'm a lazy phone addict.


I started writing online for fun,  then it became a way to escape my dysfunctional and chaotic family life.

Now I don't know how to slow down enough, to be brave enough, to try something new by writing the novel i've always wanted to."
4553,"I couldn‚Äôt even afford to move out if I had roommates! If you want a two bedroom place in my ‚Äúcity‚Äù (which isn‚Äôt even big), rent starts at $1,600. After my car payment, student loans, phone, car insurance, other bills, and food, I bring home...maybe $250 a month? Lol it‚Äôs pathetic."
4554,"In a nutshell, certain other things are taking longer than we thought they would to fall into place so we could move, and life has gone by a bit more quickly than I presumed it would. 

Long version: The university I went to is a major land-grant institution in a decent sized city. Undergrad and Masters there took me to my mid 20's. Then I got married and my husband and I were both working at said university; we decided it would be beneficial for him to obtain his PhD (it is a good idea for his field), so he pursued that while working full time, and in the meantime we had three children.  We've pretty much been tied to this area to be near the university until he finishes up (on track for this year), but there is a lot of uncertainty in where he will work afterwards. It is taking slightly longer than we thought but he's way too far in to abandon now, and I would never want him to do that anyway. His next job, if he doesn't stay where he is now, will still likely be in our state, but in the meantime I'm watching my kids grow up so fast and more and more it just presses on my heart that I haven't been able to give them the space I always dreamed I would for them.  Let alone the fact I am just really unhappy living in a more densely populated area without a lot of ""psychological head space"" ie, open space and nature. It is a bit of a logistical and emotional cluster. 

My husband is very supportive of this dream of mine (we talk about it a lot) and we've always agreed that moving to the country would be the final destination for our crew. First fall through was right after our oldest was born. The government was handing out the stimulus money to first time homebuyers so we had a very short window to find a house, and the one reasonable option with acreage on our measly newlywed with newborn budget was on a very busy road so we settled for a quiet neighborhood. Second time was after that house and before moving into our current house when my husband was just starting his PhD. It simply couldn't be justified asking him to commute well over an hour each way (that is on average how far one has to commute where we live to find decent acreage and general rural feel of working downtown/university) to work and class every day when he was pulling 13-15 hour days with evening classes. We moved to our current home saying we would be here for about 5 years until he was done then move. We hit 5 years last December. And I just didn't realize truly how quickly kids grow up. Especially once you hit 1st grade. It just flies. 

Sorry for the ramble. I didn't realize how cathartic that would feel to get it off my chest."
4555,I worked on doing that in therapy recently and it was very helpful@
4556,Thank you! God knows I need all the help I can get.
4557,Amen. Money buys basic needs. Basic needs provides a sense of well-being.  Well-being leads to security.  Security produces peace. Peace equals happiness.  Purchase complete.
4558,"I‚Äôll definitely check it out!

Also just want to say, love your username haha :)"
4559,If you‚Äôre in Missouri by chance... hahaha
4560,"Also, there‚Äôs an app called Vina! For women to meet locally. I actually matched with some girls and FaceTimed with one last week. We clicked really well and I‚Äôm hoping we can become good friends. Never thought I‚Äôd be swiping an app for friends! LOL!"
4561,But what if you really hate working out around other people? Not only because I'm self conscious but I find that I'm so miserable after a workout that I dont want to be near ANYBODY. I've snapped at my mom a few times for trying to talk to me after exercising before...sorry mom üòñ
4562,"I'm not the OP, but I've been going to the gym for about a year before coronavirus hit. I would still get a little nervous going there, but you always feel so much better afterwards. Once you get in the doors and on a machine, it's easier to focus."
4563,"Think about yourself in a years time if you go to the gym, and if you don't go to the gym. Which image and way of living do you prefer? Is it worth sacrificing that life because you're worried about what other people think? Once you start going itll become like 2nd nature.  Nobody at the gym gives 2 hoots about what you look like or are doing, everyone is too wrapped up in their own thing!!"
4564,"I had to learn to skate for hockey. Fall on your ass spectacularly in front of children a few times and you'll lose your ego. What's important is that you keep showing up. You'll still fall down every now and then, but realize that little failures mean you are growing. Tell yourself that you belong there as much as anyone else."
4565,Whenever I tried to start running I'd go full force and burn out 2 minutes in. It definitely built up my endurance over the 8 weeks. I run 5 miles every other day usually but thinking of upping to a 10k.
4566,"Same. Not weight gain or loss, but I'm toned and pretty fit, and... Don't really like it. Tried something I 'love,' but that was only to facilitate playing sports and looking my best. I  40 and don't really like it, like I don't like laundry or cooking. But I do it for the outcome not the journey, and have accepted that. Free weights, lucky enough to have a space for a treadmill, and do lots of little things while I watch TV. For me, it was accepting disciplined routine rather than enjoyment, and I think that's an okay way to go about it"
4567,"I'm the same way. I've tried so many things and I don't like any of them. Running, walking, lifting weights, yoga, basketball, dancing, tennis, biking. I don't like doing it, I don't feel good after. I kind of hate when people insist that I will like it if I stick with it or if I try something different. It doesn't mean I can't do it anyway, even without enjoying it, but I don't enjoy it."
4568,"A thing I do is to build it into my life as a functional thing.

So I cycle to work, rather than take the car. I don't buy a parking permit, so I have to cycle. I never feel like cycling, but actually when I am on my bike, it's fine.

I try to walk places if they are local.

I take the stairs, rather than the lift.

Just lots of little things, but they all add up."
4569,lol I'm between 25 and 26 and this is me. Never even really legit liked anyone. My dad never dated till he was 25 then he got married to my mum after a couple years dating and they worked out well. I think that will be me except much later if I ever get married.
4570,"It does suck, but it is all practice until it isn‚Äôt. I even had a practice marriage, as it turned out. I say that jokingly, as very very few would marry as a knowing non-binding thing, but for me that mindset helped.  Also, there are dating coaches, therapists, and matchmakers for just this sort of thing. Many many people aren‚Äôt great at this, just like anything, and sometimes investing in assistance is just the thing."
4571,"the joke in my friend group is the opposite, they think I'm asexual. I just have really high standards haha. I can't go ""oh that's a good looking person imma fall in love."" There are tons of good looking people around me and I can't fall for them all. It takes time for me to actually develop feelings and to know someone well enough to like them. Hard to commit when you only see people once a week or less for a few hours at a time."
4572,"My grandma has a group of ladies that call themselves the sister chicks. They do movies once a month, celebrate birthdays by going out to dinner and take vacations together. They make group T-shirt‚Äôs and everything! Honestly looks like a 60-something bachelorette party. They make friends everywhere they go."
4573,Can I sign up too?
4574,Me too!
4575,I love this exchange ü•∞ü•∞
4576,"This is wholesome. You two are great, I hope that's the start of a great friendship, have fun people ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4577,"This is so wholesome. Good luck to you guys and your new friendship ‚Äì I met some of my best friends on the internet, and I wouldn't change anything."
4578,Thank you for taking the time to reply to me x
4579,"Thanks, good luck to you too! I really hope it works out! I'm a nurse so I think that's why they're still going ahead. Closing on the 27th!"
4580,"Haha, good point! People online lie, I forget that sometimes (especially when I want to feel sorry for myself! Lol)"
4581,Any thoughts on the country location?
4582,Thank you precioussss :)
4583,"Try martial arts. It‚Äôs a great community (the family dojos, not the ones for meat heads), the workouts are incredible, and you feel accomplished and fantastic at the end of every lesson. And you get the added bonus of self esteem and you feel less vulnerable. It might help with your post workout mood!"
4584,I had a major hip injury surgery and am getting back to it. It‚Äôs a very humbling not being able to run more than 2 miles when this time last year I was running 7-10 at a time. I‚Äôll be back in another year!
4585,This is such a healthier and more realistic perspective - especially your last sentence. I‚Äôve never looked at it like this. Thank you.
4586,"My dad had a couple girlfriends but never anything serious and was convinced he was never gonna get married or have kids. Well he met my mom at 29, they got married a year later, and had four kids lol. I‚Äôm 28 and have never had anything serious so I‚Äôm just hoping I take after my dad lol"
4587,"Ohmigah üò≠ how are we narrating my parents love story to me? üòÇ. Also same! I can count 1 solid crush in my whole life - which I am working through right now. But, yah know COVID19. So üò§ more than likely going back to square one."
4588,"I mean, you don‚Äôt fall in love because someone is attractive. It can just spark some initial interest. And if you have talked to the person a couple of times and you find them interesting, you can go out with them to get to know them better and then you fall in love. After dating for a while. So I think what you said is completely normal."
4589,This is so cute! I wanna do that when I grow up.
4590,My mom and her friends do this. They call themselves the black hat ladies. They wear wild decorated black hats when they go out once a month and all get together. Sometimes they go to the dinner theater and see a play or just go to dinner. They seem to have a lot of fun. I‚Äôm jealous that I don‚Äôt have a circle of friends like that
4591,Me!!
4592,Also me?
4593,Me to!
4594,Me too.
4595,Meeee toooo!
4596,Me too!! I‚Äôve been wanting this as most of my family and friends don‚Äôt travel as much
4597,Can I join?
4598,"I've always wanted to live somewhere in Europe with universal healthcare, but all the research I've done over the years makes it look impossible for someone in my position."

4600,i have a feeling our dads would be on reddit if they were 1 generation later haha
4601,"covid is a great opportunity to develop emotional connection and not base the relationship on physical traits... i think, that is more important long term"
4602,"Ya totally agree with what you said. It takes time to develop interest and love. My problem is that I can't even really develop a serious crush even with attractive people. Every attractive person around me I either lose feelings of attraction for them after a while or I grow to like them as a friend. I once worked with a person who did runway modelling part time and though the person was attractive both in looks and personality, I liked (not like like) the person enough that after a while I didn't really have enough feelings (for them) left to pursue. Another time I was asked out by a person I thought was physically attractive and nice, at that time I was super oblivious to the suggestion and laughed it off but even then I thought we had no long term prospects together so I shot it down before even giving it a chance. Prob be alone unless some other person comes and tries to pick me up. Whatever, I'll just adopt a puppy. :)"
4603,ME TOO please! I desperately want this!
4604,Oh can I sign up as well!
4605,"I don't know what your position is, but there are a lot of ways to resettle in a new country. I hope you find your way there."
4606,I‚Äôd love to be included!
4607,"Thank you for the encouragement, but I sure I've researched all roads and they all hit a dead end. Having money or a specialized education would've made it easier."
4608,"Bummer. Too late for that education?  
Or like...English teacher program?"
4609,"My anxiety has been at an all time high lately. It has not been this bad in years. What I have found helpful is taking a bath every night, going outside even just to the backyard for a breath of fresh air, and I got some calming and melatonin vitamins to help me calm down and sleep."
4610,i'm gonna go ahead and say that listening to Elliot Smith while alone to think about your thoughts IS NOT HELPFUL
4611,Ativan. My psychiatrist wrote me a prescription to help me sleep because my anxiety skyrocketed with the coronavirus. It was already bad because I'm going through cancer treatment. Being immune compromised during a pandemic made it a million times worse.
4612,"Yoga and cognitive therapy.
Also a book from Tal Ben Shahar: ""Being Happy"""
4613,Tbh the best thing has been the window in my living room and the plants on the window sill.

4615,Mac and cheese and figuring out which princess I am.
4616,Listening to the birds signing outside. And not watching the news and lavender on my pillow
4617,"Coco Peru's Thoughts While In Solitude on YouTube.  Every night after the kids are in bed, I go outside and sit on my front steps alone, in the dark, and I listen to Coco tell me a story from his life for about 6 minutes. It's cathartic.  Just a few minutes to myself to hear a story in the dark before bed. If it's raining I go in the garage, but I've been lucky and have spent the last week mostly on the steps. It's like meditating or something."
4618,"I went through decadess of different kinds of therapy.
For anyone in general, I would recommend the book The Four Agreements.

For people who struggle with neediness, unstable or toxic relationships, I recommend the books Facing Codependence by Pia Melody, and Getting the Love You Want.

For people with depression, I recommend a class on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy developed my Marsha Linahan.

For people with triggers or mood swings, I recommend Dialectical Behavior Therapy.

But to be honest it was a lot easier to move forward and implement what I learned after I got off hormonal birth control and went back to having regular periods (that took 3 years) and changing my diet to low-carb, moderate protein and higher fat. 

I also noticed I cried less and wasn't as emotionally sensitive when I was lifting weights regularly. In fact, my body-building phase was probably the most emotionally stable I have ever been and I have been an athletic cardio girl my whole life so there is something to be said for weights and not just exercise in general.

I didn't heal from sexual trauma until I met a man who didn't want to have sex before marriage. I always felt obligated to perform sexually for others and even if I was with someone nice and respectful, having sex with them made me relive it and it would compound my trauma.

TLDR; reputable self-help books written by specialists,
Getting off hormonal birth control, changing my diet, lifting weights instead of cardio. Give yourself permission to stop reliving trauma for the sake of others."
4619,"Crying. A LOT. Sounds a bit mental but hey it works ! 

Also, I had to uninstall some news apps because all the corona info was making me stress out my pants . Would definitely recommend this if anyone's feeling on the verge of everything."

4621,Spotify

4623,If you‚Äôre in school perhaps they offer my SSP which allows you to text a therapist if needed. Otherwise I think writing a journal is very helpful.
4624,"I found an moodtracking app called Moodpath. It's pretty cool. It's asking you some questions 3 times a day about your feelings and u can compare each week, see some cool graphs. You are also clicking what emotion are you feeling right now for example : active, confident, empty, lonely etc. And add your own notes. I think it's useful to see how your mood is changing during whole day, and read some,,insights"" which basicly explain to you some of your feelings. Literally a very cool and easy to read articles. I highly recommend it!"
4625,Not really a resource but it always makes me feel better to read that I'm not alone with my particular issue (anxiety).

4630,"My therapist asked me to start keeping a journal. I thought it was a dumb idea, but did it not to waste her time. It has actually been super helpful for me."
4631,"Sunshine. I know you may not think it a resource but 30mins in it doing something pleasurable works wonders.

Let me add..i have a backyard with fruit trees and veg soooo...may not be for all."
4632,"Icloud from the NHS is good for anxiety. It's an online self referral. You complete a questionnaire and it gives you a different resource depending on your needs, I have the anxiety and depression modules. You gradually work through them helping you understand the reasons behind it and gives you tools to help, such as relaxation walk through. You get a dedicated mental health professional from a hospital who calls you to see how you are doing and what they can do to help, they also provide online help if your feeling like you need it (i know not everyone likes to talk on the phone) and regular questionnaire checks to make sure your care is still tailored relevantly. Everything that the professional feels necessary also goes straight to your doctor on your file so that if you need to consult them, they have all the up to date information.
Ive only been doing it for a couple of months so am new to it, but as a free self referral I find it useful."
4633,I find the headspace app is great for getting me to sleep when my head is whirring before bed. Just found out about an online tool called big white wall which has a lot of resources. Also singing whilst talking to my pets!
4634,Woebot!! Always reminding me to write something in my gratitude journal and helping me through my thought distortions. I'm so grateful for it!

Also long walks through the neighborhood with my wife. We like looking at all the different houses and deciding which one we would buy if we were rich. She requires a pool."
4638,Weekly telehealth therapy appointments have literally been a lifesaver. Virtually all therapists are switching to video chat at the moment; they're still available!
4639,Just started using an online therapy service. So hope it works as I continue to use its services.
4640,"I‚Äôve really enjoyed the Calm app after resisting it for so long, also the Daylio mood tracker app!"

Also, I enjoy sleep meditation hypnosis. You can find all kinds of cool meditation videos for different purposes like stomach issues, headaches, insomnia. They work well for me."

4661,Just downloaded the audiobook! Can‚Äôt wait to listen to it.
4662,"Came here to recommend this too. I like to add notes for specifically good days or if something really funny happened so that when I'm down, I can look at it and remember. 

It's also really good to put things into perspective. When I'm down for more than a couple of hours, I end up feeling like I've been down for days and there's no end to it. Instead, I can look at the app and go - actually, yesterday wasn't that bad, this is temporary."
4663,"Wow..this is great. Ive been trying to help my childhood friend. We used to walk home at 8yrs old and now we are 55yrs old. She lives with her nephew and his gf and the shelter in place has been rough for her. 2weeks ago she was with her nephew (47yrs) getting food and a guy shot him. He died in her arms..she isnt doing good. I cant hug her or kiss her cheek a billion times but I can help her with this.
Thank you thank you thank you!"
4664,"No shame. I take care of my grama and getting some kisses from her works for me. Hanging out with her is a blast but when she hugs me and say ""oh I love you bad ass girl"" melts my heart"

I step away from situations to assess how I feel and how to continue forward.   
I try and stick to a stretch/exercise routine, even if it‚Äôs just doing some 5lbs weight lifting.   
I guess it‚Äôs not a lot but I‚Äôm still working on building something that works for me and where I am now.

Exercise is on the list but not limited to personal growth only."
4671,"I'm getting back into my Japanese. It's easier to find time to do voice calls with people in different time zones now that everything is cancelled.

I'm stretching every day. I was a major gym junkie and played a lot of soccer pre-quarantine, and didn't really take care of myself. I'm working on doing proper rehabilitation for existing injuries and (hopefully) preventing new ones."
4672,I take online classes through EdX and make daily to-do lists!
4673,"Journaling, reading, getting some sunshine even if it's cloudy and I just sit on the porch. Also weight lifting which has done as much for me mentally as it has physically"
4674,This my sound weird but I‚Äôm taking a leadership class that has taught me a lot on emotional intelligence and reflecting on your own actions. I try every day before I go to bed to take a few minutes to talk to myself on what I did that day and what I‚Äôll be doing tomorrow. If I‚Äôm happy with what I accomplished and if I think I need a break. I even talk to myself on work issues I might need to handle or problems for an exam. I feel like it has made me more motivated and more organized. It‚Äôs also good to alleviate stress. It‚Äôs very important for every person to do some type of reflection on themselves to reward or criticize your own actions. It‚Äôs a big part of personal growth
4675,I listen a lot to peoples different life experiences
4676,"I really reflect a lot and try to be honest with myself. I really sit and think about the things I‚Äôm bad at and how I can improve. Progress takes time, it‚Äôs okay if you mess up and revert back to your old ways temporarily. Just as long as you recognize it and try to do better next time. I look at other people‚Äôs qualities that I like and try to do those things myself."
4677,"this might sound strange but... i enter insights and thoughts and future plans etc. into excel, add several labels to the thought and then analyze thoughts in batches. the goal is to figure out patterns/triggers/the root of the problem.

i've tried journaling, but i can't will myself to have insights... they just kind of happen, hence the thought journal."
4678,"Small, very small habits for each day. I practice an amalgamation of *Atomic Habits*, *Tiny Habits* and tips I've picked up from Gretchen Rubin, specifically her idea for building habits into one's identity. I also love typology and personality typing, but that's more for fun."
4679,"Trying to finish my software engineering degree. 

I'm already well into my career and probably a step or two away from getting into management/leadership, and I'm just 25. 

I don't personally care for the degree, but it's to check off a list, get my master's and then decide whether pursuing a Doctorate in Robotics is something I still want to do. 

Other things I do for growth and development is push myself in running my non-profit."
4680,"I think about an insecurity of mine, set myself before a mirror, look myself in the eyes, and convince myself that I‚Äôm not insecure about that ‚Äî or, as I like to call it: ‚Äúun-insecuring‚Äù myself.

Last year, I became under the impression that a close friend of mine wanted to do something bad to themselves. (Won‚Äôt go into the specifics, but their behavior changed, they started making strange jokes, they started hinting at things.) I reported them, and they were extremely betrayed. It hurt me just as much as it hurt them, and I was suddenly thrown into a loop of ‚Äúoh my God, I‚Äôm such a horrible, horrible friend.‚Äù After that, I became incredibly insecure about my capabilities as a friend and became paranoid; I thought new people I met disliked me, that I suddenly needed to work harder to keep and prove my friendships, I made far-fetched assumptions, I didn‚Äôt allow myself to open up to anybody for fear of them leaving me. It was pretty unhealthy. I just kept thinking ‚Äúgosh, I keep messing all of my friendships up.‚Äù I allowed myself to become lost to this insecurity, allowed it to overwhelm me and control me.

A few days ago, I was sitting on the floor of my room, and I just decided, ‚Äúwell, why don‚Äôt I just un-insecure myself?‚Äù Sat myself in front of a full-length mirror and told myself that I‚Äôve always been a good, capable friend ‚Äî that what happened wasn‚Äôt my fault, that I had, in fact, done the right thing for that friend. That I was a good friend for reporting them, because they told me later that it had helped. I just kept telling myself in this stern voice, ‚Äú(name), you *are* a good friend. What happened wasn‚Äôt your fault.‚Äù Kept repeating that and listing reasons why, until I went silent and finally admitted:

‚ÄúYes, *I* am a good friend. I am.‚Äù

I could feel the shift in me, like a light switch turning on with a click. The weight fell off of me, and I felt this incredible, triumphant euphoria. Because, to simmer it down, all I‚Äôd done was tell myself the truth.

Just ask yourself, ‚Äúwell, why don‚Äôt I un-insecure myself?‚Äù Find yourself a pen and a sheet of paper and write out all of the reasons why your insecurity should just go eff off. Take control over your insecurity. Grab it by the collar and snarl in its face. Tell it why it shouldn‚Äôt exist. Squash it with *your* truth.

Maybe you‚Äôll realize something about yourself‚Äî mostly, that if you fiercely believe in losing that insecurity, you‚Äôll find that it‚Äôs gone after you‚Äôve taken your fists and crunched it."
4681,"I think one of the best and smallest things I have done this year is this: if it takes 5 minutes, just do it (I sometimes extend this out to 10/15 minutes, but same concept still applies). I'm the last couple years I would procrastinate so bad that even a couple sentence email to my lawyer would get out off for a week or more because I didn't want to do it. So now if I have a task like that (sending a quick email, putting a dish in the sink, putting the recyclables away, checking my phone voicemails) I do it in that moment and it's done. No agonizing over little stupid stuff"
4682,"I set myself a number of concrete goals and work out how I'm going to achieve them. My goals are realistic, time limited and are broken down into small steps. I'm constantly doing this, reviewing the goals, setting new ones, evaluating old ones etc."
4683,Heroic doses of LSD every now and then.
4684,"I definitely need to work on step away and assessing how I feel and I'm really glad you can do that! 
I think it's a perfect amount of stuff to be trying to do and I hope you continue to build what works for you üíï"
4685,"That's great, what kind of things do you reflect back on? What kind of questions do you ask?"
4686,Do you have any podcasts or books you would recommend? :)
4687,What kind of classes do you take? :)
4688,"That doesn't sound weird it sounds amazing! Is it an online class?
That sounds really healthy, go you! üòä"
4689,That's really healthy and definitely not something I'm good at. I love that you've said it's ok to mess up üíï
4690,I'm really into that idea and I think that would really help me because I don't feel like I know myself at all. Thank you so much for sharing :)
4691,"Oh wow, well done. I'm close to 25 and at the bottom of the ladder but I guess that's because I only started my career a year ago. Go you for getting your degree done!

What's your non-profit? :)"
4692,"I'm definitely going to try that!

And it really doesn't sound like you were a bad friend. Trying to get someone help makes you a great friend and proves how much you care about that person. I'm sorry you had such a hard time with that and I'm really glad you're feeling better üíï"
4693,I've been really trying to do that as well and it's really improved my quality of life. I'm glad it's working for you too!
4694,How do you set your goals? Could you give an example? :)
4695,"This isn‚Äôt self help, but I like this one:

4696,Feel free to message me for books! Those are definitely self-improvement.
4697,"I'm taking one on biostatistics right now to further my career goals, but they have just a ton! Can't recommend enough :)"
4698,No it‚Äôs actually a course offered by my university and if I take the class plus two more I can get a certificate.
4699,Good luck!
4700,Thank you so much!
4701,"Sure! First I would have a think about aspects of my life that I'd like to improve. For example, over the last year I've not really had any creative outlets and I wanted to change that. So my top level goal was to find a creative hobby or pursuit that I would enjoy. I broke that down into smaller goals. 

One of them was around playing the piano (which I used to as a child), so I broke that down into other smaller goals. The first goal was acquiring a piano and some sheet music, which I got for Christmas. The next goal was working out how rusty I was, so I tried a range of different pieces and tried to assess how easy/hard they were. When I was a child I achieved Grade 8 but I found that Grade 6/7 pieces were a comfortable level of challenge for me. I then set myself the goal of perfecting one piece a month (it's not all I play, but I would choose a specific piece that would be my personal 'performance' piece). That was going to feed into a larger goal which is to do a performance to friends/family by the end of 2020. I then thought about how to track my progress, so after talking to friends for ideas, I decided to start recording myself playing the 'performance' piece once a week. I could then listen back to that and see where the improvements were and what I needed to work on. 

That's how I approach most of my goals. There's first an exploration period, then being really clear about what I want to do, then setting time limits on my goals, then monitoring them to check what I've achieved."
4702,"I'm definitely going to have a look, now is a good time since I'm working from home! Thanks :)"
4703,"That's really helpful, thank you so much for breaking that process down! I hope you're having fun with the piano :)"
4704,"When she was a baby? I dunno, whenever she was hungry or wet or whatever, a normal amount. I never counted. Now? She gets teary around her period and when she's tired or frustrated, so maybe once or twice a month. Dunno that she cries at night as we're in separate rooms."
4705,Almost never lol even as babies they only cried when they needed a change or a feed or to be picked up etc. Now they cry now and then but not daily. (I have 5 kids from 2-10 years old)
4706,"They cried a decent amount when they were newborns. They‚Äôre ~~18 months~~ 21 months, I don't even know my own children's ages LOL oops - and don‚Äôt cry often except sometimes when they don‚Äôt get their way, usually when food is involved. They sleep through the night now and don‚Äôt cry."
4707,"I have a 16 month old. He didn't cry much when he was a baby. Occasionally in the car or when he was hungry, sick, etc. now he cries when he gets frustrated sometimes or when he accidentally hits his head or has a slip. Or sometimes when I leave the room and when he fights sleep. 

He doesn't wake up at night. I'd say maybe once a month he wakes me up but he puts himself back to sleep."
4708,"My almost 10 year old isn't a crier. It's the one trait of mine she didn't seem to get.

My 3 year old isn't a bad crier either. She's just quiet."
4709,"They're all between the ages of 6 and 17, so not very often. When they were babies, constantly. One had colic and it was essentially non stop crying for about 3 months."
4710,"At 4 months, frequently but not for long - usually briefly when he wakes, when he's hungry, or when he's getting tired. He grizzles more often than that. 

Around 3 hours a day is normal around 6-8 weeks. It should start to be less around 12 weeks. If it's concerning you check out *purple crying.*"
4711,"My son almost never crys. He babbles incessantly and screams just to hear himself scream, but he only really crys a few times a week, and it's almost always random."
4712,"My 6 month old mostly whines. If we don‚Äôt give her what she wants in what she thinks is a timely manner, the crying starts to whining. She probably cries 5 times a day, maybe. She cries whenever she wakes up at night, too, which is once or twice."
4713,[removed]
4714,Oh they're not 2 yet. When my oldest was 2 she threw the worst tantrums and was violent. My youngest was sweet and shy at 2. Flip a coin!
4715,"My kid is 11, and she's not a crier either.  Definitely not like her mom!"
4716,did the colicky one sleep at all during this crying phase?

4718,"Yes, but not nearly as much as the others."
4719,There‚Äôs this YouTubed called Lille Jean who is absolutely convinced that she is famous. She thinks she‚Äôs a beauty guru. She pretends that brands sponsor her. She crops herself into pictures with celebrities and at big events. She has bought all her followers. She calls herself an artist even though her art is elementary level. Her mother is completely supportive of this behavior. Anyone who points any of this out is blocked and called a ‚Äúcyberbully.‚Äù I find it fascinating because it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous.
4720,"Girl I went to high school with has never stopped believing that she is married to an archangel on the astral plane. This belief fed into her enormous superiority complex, her sense of being special and a martyr for love (victimized by the ignorance of the human race, who was of course inferior in comparison her enlightened mind). 

This belief gave her the justification to look down on other people, men in particular (all disgusting pigs who wanted to sleep with her), relationships (human relationships paled in comparison to her astral marriage, which ironically was unhealthy, from what she described) her own family (whom she regarded as silly and narrow-minded but loved to leech off of, and many of her friends."
4721,"Back when I was working at a small crappy copy shop I had a returning client who was absolutely bizarre. He was an indian man who moved all the way to Russia for some reason and was trying to establish some kind of ayurveda-themed pseudo-scientific cult around himself.

I designed various leaflets and business cards for him, including his very own card. It stated there under his name that he was simultaneously a university professor, a director of some fake scientific organization, a president of another one, had multiple PhDs and, I quote, was ""the only living Mahatma in the present day"". One of the leaflets also directly compared him to Ghandi, cause you know, why not.

The weirdest thing - aside form the fact that such an important and busy man would order his business cards all by himself at the crappy copy shop - was that he appeared to be very humble and shy in person. Like, there were no demands of special treatment or anything, no arrogance. He would just calmly state his insanely long title to me like it's not a big deal. And he really seemed to believe himself to be this amazing super spiritual super educated academic man."
4722,I had a co-worker who sincerely believed he was going to be the next L. Ron Hubbard.
4723,"I'll put my neck out there and share one of myself. Sometimes it's funny and enlightening to look at one's own flaws and craziness. It's how we improve and better understand others. Like the psychiatrist Carl Jung said, ""Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darknesses of other people."" True words.

I was in a real bad period in my life where I was constantly admitted to the psych ward. In one such stay I was pacing up and down the hall with a blanket wrapped around me and the nurse asked me to unwrap myself so I didn't trip over the fabric and fall down. I protested and  when I didn't get my way I launched into a tirade about how I was the daughter of the Roman Emperor and would have the entire staff put to the sword for ordering me around. I was actually talking like that and for but a brief moment... I believed it. Crazy stuff.

Later I sincerely apologized to everyone, it was more of a funny matter anyway. No one viewed me as a threat or anything. It was just a moment where I reflected and told myself, ""Wow... girl you need to get your life right, lol"""
4724,"I went on a date with a guy once that told me he could make anyone orgasm by just looking at them. I haven't heard from him in years, I wish him well though."
4725,"Well, my mom is type I bipolar, so quite a few. The strangest was when she had a psychotic episode and thought she was the president's wife. She rear-ended someone then began screaming to the police and everyone else that she was the president's wife."
4726,"Online dating mistakes back in the mid 2000s. Met a guy online and was kinda interested, so I added him to Myspace. It turns out he was a complete asswipe, so I deleted him.

A few months later, I'd already forgotten him and he readded me. He had the same first name as one of my acquaintances, so I accepted without screening it too hard. He immediately PM'd me and told me that he was, ""Welcoming me back into his kingdom.""

What kingdom? The rural Walmart where he worked? I just laughed and blocked him."
4727,"I was inpatient in a psych facility for a few weeks a while back. I met a woman who seemed totally normal. I talked to her about random stuff all day. Nice lady. After dinner, we're sitting around and she goes ""do you believe in vampires?"" I say no, no I do not. She tells me I should and that her vampire boyfriend from New York is going to come visit her. She also believed twilight was real. She describes this boyfriend like every chick novel describes the love interest. Tall, muscular, handsome, ride or die, passionate fellow that's also weirdly ""protective""(controlling). Everyone else at the facility starts wondering if anyone is actually going to visit her. So the day comes and she has me braid her hair for her. Someone did show up. The guy was a tiny old hippie man in a tie-dye shirt and long silver hair. Not sure if I was disappointed or if it ended up better than imagined."
4728,"My aunt is bi-polar with some serious anger issues. For about a year straight this portly black woman thought she was Beyonce. She bought clothes similar to her music videos and her prized possession were these sunglasses that supposedly Beyonce wore all the time (idk, I'm not a fan) she thought it'd be cute to try them on my baby sister at the time and they broke. She put a lamp through the wall."
4729,Just yesterday my brother sent my a picture of himself with a bundle of maybe $200 in his mouth (gross) and said he got it from his ‚Äúsugar mama‚Äù. He sent it to me to gloat.
4730,"On a very serious note, my mother. She's mentally ill and grandiose delusions are a big constant. I never *really* noticed when I was younger but now looking back, it's previous obvious it has always happened.  
  
On a lighter note, this girl I knew from HS + uni. She ended up meeting someone just as bad and they founded some sort of.... cult-ish thing. Most of the therapies they advertise seem made up words to sound fancier and complicated (I can't really translate into English what doesn't exist, but imagine something like *motherlogy hermetism therapy* and so on). They think their children are vessels of Jesus and their names are something like Infant Saviour and Regina Nova.  
  
The thing is, if you follow or have known them long enough, they keep coming up and then quietly changing new companies/therapy names/business ventures, so it's pretty obvious it's not that legit, because if they *truly* believed in whatever they were spouting, they'd stick with it instead of re-adapting every time it goes bust.  
  
We fell out in the early days of this thing because she was claiming a 100% fake bio (she's from a wealthy family that made their wealth during the colonies, not from what she was claiming *at all*) and I called her out on it, back when FB was really popular lol."
4731,"One of myself. I went through a lot of abuse and traumas. So, one day I decided I was a witch. I would do spells and rituals, claimed I controlled the weather. Would talk to the old tree in the schoolyard. I used being a witch to make myself stronger. I have this power that you don't. That can't hurt me because I'm a witch. And while dancing in the fairy circles was all fine and dandy, it wasn't helping me face my reality. I really. Really believed. In it. (I even tried love spells, it's engrained in my memory)"
4732,"At a ‚Äúget to know you‚Äù work lunch, this woman said she is a classically trained concert pianist. Just the way she said it (pee-un-East) dripped with delusions of grandeur. 

Someone else in the group was incredibly impressed and asked where she had performed. She said something like ‚Äúoh various places‚Äù. Then he asked when her next performance would be because he really wanted to see her perform. Now the story has changed, she hasn‚Äôt performed in years, maybe a decade. 

I start doing the math. This chick is 27 tops and the only concerts she played at were the high school talent show in the gymnasium."
4733,"My mother was admitted to the psych ward last week. I came home from uni for spring break. She was perfectly fine when I got here. A few days later my school announced it would be shut down for the rest of the semester so I went to go get my stuff with my cousin. I was gone for like 2 days because I slept over her house as well. I came back on Saturday afternoon. My mom didn't seem quite right, she has a long history of severe mental illness and inpatient hospitalizations since I was a child. I just kept monitoring her and making sure she was taking her pills. That night we went to sleep and she woke me up like at 3 in the morning. She was convinced she had won the Nobel Peace Prize. Insisted she was told through her phone. I told her I didn't think so and she got extremely upset so I told her to just try to sleep. Next couple of days got progressively worse and we made it to Tuesday until we had to go take her to the ER. Miss her a lot but Im hoping she comes out this week."
4734,"I will also share one of myself (please be gentle with me). I went through a period in my early twenties when my mental health declined very rapidly. I was living in student accommodation in a foreign country so had literally no support system. I was so depressed I sometimes would not even open my eyes for over 24 hours. I have always had an active imagination, and for some reason I got this idea in my head that it would be cool if I was the daughter of a foreign politician or millionaire or something. I went down to reception and asked the guy there if they had the blueprints for the building because ‚Äúmy security needed to see it‚Äù.

I can only imagine what that man must have thought of me, I still feel embarrassed just remembering about it, even though it was almost a decade ago."
4735,"I didn't witness this, but this is a story that my very arrogant philosophy professor told our class. When he was drafted for the Vietnam War, my professor went to a psychiatrist to get a diagnosis so that he wouldn't have to serve. As a result, this man got out of the Vietnam draft because his psychiatrist told the US Government that he suffered from ""delusions of grandeur."" The best part is that anybody who's taken a class with him knows that the diagnosis is actually pretty accurate."

4742,"I went to high school with a girl who was a pathological liar. It didn‚Äôt matter how blatantly obvious the lie was, or if she was called out with proof of her lying, she never admitted to a single one. She really thought she could make something true just by saying it and believing in it herself. 

One of her lies was that she was cousins with Blackstreet. Which one? All of them. Mind you, this girl was lily white. She thought she was a gifted singer and insisted on auditioning for every band and talent show. She was astoundingly tone deaf. One day she managed to get on stage for a showcase and it sounded like cats being tortured slowly to death. 

She stole things from people and then brought them out in front of her victims like it was nothing. She stole my friend‚Äôs notebook and whipped it out like a day later in class. My friend commented that she lost that exact same notebook, and ‚ÄúLook, the first few pages of your notebook have been ripped out. And also there‚Äôs a sticker right where I wrote my name on my notebook.‚Äù This girl didn‚Äôt even flinch, she was like, ‚ÄúOh haha that‚Äôs weird, it‚Äôs brand new, my mom got it for me.‚Äù

I‚Äôve always wondered what became of her life. None of her lies were ever remotely plausible, so I don‚Äôt think she had the smarts to become some kind of criminal mastermind, or any kind of mastermind. She had no real friends because she kept stealing from them and the compulsive lying was not great either."
4743,"Guy I once knew was an absolute doozy in this respect. Whenever anyone asked what he did for a living, he said he was a freelance press photographer. Turned out he'd had one photo published in a very small local paper ten years prior of overflowing rubbish bins in the street, but still insisted he was a press photographer. He also told everyone that he was going out with a supermodel. The girl turned out to be a stripper at one of the local dives."
4744,"I worked with a man who fully believed that he was some sort of million year old angelic warrior. This branched from his many, many conspiracy theories that he talked about nonstop at work. He believed (not believed- *knew*) just about every single theory with the one exception being flat earth. He thinks that Hitler & the nazis were good, and Jews are an evil race of aliens from another planet. He told me has a special ‚Äúnumber‚Äù a psychic gave him and people with that number are very rare and very important. He told me he was an ancient king and a Viking/angel mashup that is here to save the world from the elites."

4749,"I worked with someone who went to New York and came back and was telling me about her vacation. She told me she saw a broadway play and how amazing it was. Then she said while she was watching she realized she wanted to do that, that she could do that. I figured she meant she was going to get into local theatre or something, and asked her if that was her intention. I also commented on what a rewarding hobby that could be. 

Oh my god if looks could kill! She stared at me and told me that no, she was going to be on Broadway. She was so angry and insulted. And she was absolutely convinced that she, a 30 something year old woman with no musical theatre experience and a promising career in a totally unrelated field, was going to be on broadway. 

Spoiler: she hasn‚Äôt made it to broadway. Also she got fired a year or so later."
4750,"On a sillier note,

My ex legitimately believed he was some sort of sex god. He would brag about how all the women he slept with thought he was amazing. Now I sleep with the man and honestly it was the worst sex ever. The guy was so excited to hear my review and I said ‚Äúit was alright‚Äù and he was crushed."
4751,There's this guy I know who thinks he is the best president America has ever seen...
4752,"Idk if this counts but in high school I was friends with a guy who was delusional. Background info: I went to Catholic high school, so religion was not an uncommon topic of discussion. This kid was ‚Äúintellectually rebellious‚Äù (thought he was smarter than everyone he interacted with) and also obsessed with the Percy Jackson books, as well as an avid Pokemon fan. We‚Äôll call him ‚ÄúD‚Äù for delusional. 

Cut to Senior year, we‚Äôre all at lunch, and religion is the topic for some reason or another. He starts talking about how it‚Äôs just as likely for the Greek gods (a la Percy Jackson) to be real as it is for the Catholic god to be real. Sure, whatever, although according to mythology the Greek gods were pretty sensitive, so someone made a comment along the lines of ‚ÄúWell if Zeus is real, may he smite me now!‚Äù Obviously nothing happens but D gets all weird. Conversation moves on. 

The next day, he comes in fervently believing in Greek mythology. Out of nowhere. I think it became one of those things where someone else argued against it, so D got deeper and deeper into the hole of believing his own side of things. But he literally was believing in the ancient Greek gods for a solid 48 hours ago. 

A few days pass and we think things are going back to normal, until D comes in to school visibly shaken. We ask him what‚Äôs going on, and he tells us that on his drive home yesterday, he felt a ‚Äúpowerful force‚Äù trying to grab his steering wheel and essentially murder him. When he finally got home, he jumped out of the car to run inside, only for this force (he referred to it as Satan) pick him up by the throat and try to kill him. He managed to get away and run inside, and when he looked back behind him he saw a glow that he believed to be the Virgin Mary protecting him. 

All of this lead D to believe that he must be the second arrival of Jesus Christ. I told you this guy thought of himself as smarter than everyone else, but it wasn‚Äôt until this that I realized how completely narcissistic he was. 

This went on for a day or two, during which time I consulted one of our schools priests about the situation. I think my exact phrasing was ‚ÄúFather, I think something is going on, I‚Äôm just not sure whether it‚Äôs theological or psychological...‚Äù

So...Catholic school. Some of our friends were pretty devout, so their peer claiming to be the return of Christ did not sit well with many of them. One in particular quoted (I‚Äôll call him J for Jesus enthusiast) some Bible verses at D explaining that Jesus is supposed to come back in a firey blaze or something pretty much just for judgement day, not as a random Pokekid from Bumblefuck, USA. Idk the theological specifics, but J essentially tore D‚Äôs idea apart. 

D thinks for awhile and starts on some ‚ÄúWell then maybe I‚Äôm another prophet -‚Äú and barely even gets the whole theory out before J is telling him that, according to the Bible, there will be no more prophets between now and judgement day. 

Long story short, D grew up in a very manipulative and abusive household and I think after 18 years it had a profound effect on his sanity. He went to college far away, his parents divorced, and last I heard he was in a pretty serious relationship and communicates as little as possible with his family. 

TLDR - friend in high school randomly started believing in Greek gods, then believed he was the return of Jesus, then believed he was a prophet"
4753,"This isn‚Äôt about a person, and it isn‚Äôt particularly dramatic... I worked at an engineering firm that positions itself as the best in their area of expertise.  I eventually became a project manager there, although I wasn‚Äôt an engineer myself.

Now that I don‚Äôt work there, I can see how bizarre it is when an entire company is made up of people that have overinflated egos (myself included).  

They legitimately deserved kudos for their technical knowledge but there was an inability to see the limits of their knowledge and they assumed they could tackle anything themselves; there was a tendency to dismiss the expertise of others and a complete blind spot about their treatment of employees that weren‚Äôt quite so type A.  

It turned into a grotesque work environment particularly as I advanced into management."

4755,"Two of them, both I knew in high school:

1.  This guy thought he was going to be a professional basketball player.  He was 5'2"", wasn't good enough to even be on the Junior Varsity team, and lost to me the one and only time we ever played one on one.  I never even tried out for the basketball team.  To be fair to this guy though, his problem was that he was/is really really stupid.  You know how your parents tell you when you're a kid that you can be anything you want when you grow up?  As if to say that they'll support whatever you choose?  He thought they meant this literally.  As though just by ***wanting*** to be a professional basketball player that that is what would end up happening.  I hated that kid.
2. Guy wanted to be a Rapper.  To be fair to him, he wasn't half bad, but nowhere near good enough to be a star.  Not to mention that he looked like Bad Luck Brian, so to say that he didn't look the part would be the understatement of the century.  Even though I thought he was delusional when he told me that this was his plan, not wanting to be rude I didn't mock him or laugh at him to his face.  I did ask him, however, what his back up plan was in case this didn't work out.  Cue ""deer in the headlights,"" look on his face.  You could tell that the very ***idea*** that this might not work out had never even crossed his mind.  It was simply a given that he was going to be a famous rapper in his own mind.  Needless to say, he didn't have a backup plan and was overtly hostile to my question because of the implication that his dream might not happen."

She was always in a feud with Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus. She claimed they would post stuff on social media that was a coded message to her. She was deep in her delusion and I am ashamed that I gave her the benefit of the doubt. She claims a few girls in our high school knew about the relationship and one of them tried to steal him from her.

I know this is crazy and the story is very detailed. She wasn‚Äôt trying to show off, she truly believed it and she claims he used to come over her house and everything."

4763,"When I was about 15, I'd just placed really well in a national competition and was really excited about it, and I was celebrating with my friends during our lunch break.

4767,"This is pretty classic psychosis but was bizarre for me because it *was* me. About 10 years ago before I was diagnosed bipolar and medicated etc, during a period of significant stress with work etc, I slowly became aware that my favourite bands/youtubers/actors were contacting me directly through YouTube videos. It got to the point that I couldn‚Äôt go out because I had to be there when certain videos were uploaded, or to watch them at certain times because I was in relationships with these people or something (I actually can‚Äôt very clearly remember the why just the what).

Anyway eventually I quit my job and it got pretty bad from there. Went to my GP thinking I was suffering with depression and came out with a bipolar diagnosis.

The really interesting bit was when the delusions started to lift bit by bit and I started realising what a mad little thing I‚Äôd been for ages. 

Almost none of my friends had noticed. I dunno what that says about my regular personality"
4768,"I'm very bipolar and the incident that got me to finally be medicated was about 6 months ago. I was extremely manic for a couple of weeks, barely sleeping, and eventually delusional. I was 100% convinced that I was a mercenary working for the government through dead drops. Looking back, it was truly bizarre and the definition of insanity. I'm much better now, but it will be hard to trust my own mind 100% again for a while."
4769,"Pretty much anytime somebody says, ""I met <famous person> once at <random place>"" with an expectation that you will be impressed. 

It's a VERY mild delusion of grandeur compared to the other answers, but it is also very bizarre how commonplace this idea is. People who brag about meeting famous people are usually not just trying to tell a cool story, they have a delusion that the listener will respect them more after knowing that they once existed in the presence of <famous person>. Sorry, but that's not how it works. You do not become more important, powerful, or interesting just by associating with an important, powerful, or interesting person."

4779,"I don‚Äôt know if this really counts but a couple years back at my parents restaurant, this lady comes in with 5 kids tailing her and says that she knows the owner of the place and he said she could eat there for free. We‚Äôre a buffet so customers have to pay first before they eat and our prices were really cheap. Regardless I started internally laughing bc I knew she was lying. How you ask?

1. I‚Äôm the daughter of the restaurant owner and I‚Äôve never seen this lady a day in my life.

2. We‚Äôre Chinese and I know my parents are not friends with any black families due to many reasons

3. She‚Äôs come in to eat before and my parents have never talked to her when she came in

Here‚Äôs the conversation that followed:

Me: *smiling hard trying not to laugh* oh really? None of the workers were given notice, could you call the owner for me so I can confirm?

Her: He‚Äôs busy and he told me he told you guys already

Me: Could you tell me what the name of the owner is so I can confirm?

Her: Uhhh how do you work here and not know the owners name?

Me: I just wanted to ask to confirm, let me call the managers over to see if they got told anything

Her: Okay good bc I was promised a free meal for me and my family

Me: okay give me one minute *I go grab my mom and dad who are my ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù and bring them up front*

Me: *to the lady* I‚Äôll be talking to managers in Chinese to ask them about your question. *to parents* this lady says she‚Äôs your friend and that you promised her and her family free food

Parents: *blinks in confusion, looks at lady, then my dad starts laughing bc he‚Äôs a comedian and said something along the lines of ‚Äúwhy would I know this fucking crazy women‚Äù and walks away. My mom giggles and she understands and speaks English but tells me to handle the situation and stands to the side ringing up the customers behind the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù

Crazy lady/her: What‚Äôs so funny?

Me: They thought what you said was funny

Her: How is it funny? Are you going to let my family eat or not?!

Me: Yeah after you pay

Her: I told you my friend said I don‚Äôt have to pay! 

Me: yeah and my parents just told me they don‚Äôt know who you are.

Her: why do I care what your parents say, I‚Äôll call your boss if I need to and tell them you guys aren‚Äôt treating me right

Me: my parents ARE the restaurant owners 

Her: *shook and starts going uh um uh uh uh* 

*one of her kids start trying to pull her away to leave while other customers are starting to snicker bc this convo was getting loud*

Her: You‚Äôre lying *speeds her ass out the door*

This was a pretty good on going joke in our restaurant. She had no shame and continued to come eat at our place for a couple times and each time I‚Äôd yell back to the kitchen ‚ÄúMOM! DAD! YOUR FRIENDS BACK‚Äù and bust out in laughter. I was nice enough to never ask if she wanted the family friend discount though."

4785,"There is a nerd + working girl couple. I used to work with the guy and we are friends.

He is living with and financially supporting a Bulgarian working girl, who openly brings much older sugar daddies to the flat he rented.

It is a 2 bed flat. Her and the sugar daddy would chill, do whatever in her room and the lounge, while my friend is locked in his room. She cold calls guys in M&A and investment, sends message to them on LinkedIn.

She is self centred and an ultra narcissist. She was a bit annoyed that I invited my friend but not her to the wedding. When she saw me after the wedding, she tried to put me down asking why I did not have a full blown expensive wedding, ...

She is very racist, said she would never have cleaners who are not white and non-Muslim.

London is in lockdown. She is still inviting the sugar daddies over to the flat. My friend would moan to me about it. She had fever and a cough a few days ago. Symptoms of Covid19! She is still going out and inviting the sugar daddies over. She does not understand why people need to go into lockdown. She thinks weaker people should die and let everyone else carry on as normal.

Her whatsapp messages are surreal. My friend keeps sending capscreen to me. He thinks he cannot leave her. They are the same age, in their 30s. I jokingly asked if he likes BDSM, considering he is still with her after she emotionally abuses him daily. Perhaps it is some sort of fetish that I cannot appreciate. 

He always wants to buy a house but pull out last minute repeatedly, because the houses he put offer on are not up to her standard. She only wants to live in a penthouse in central London, like the flat he is renting now. He does not have the means to save for a deposit for a million pound flat. Maybe when he is 40/50, he will get the deposit and buy the flat they are living in. By that time, if she is still single, I think she will settle for him.

As a good friend, all I can do is to listen. But sometimes it is painful to listen to him."
4786,"A former in-law was totally convinced that men are the prophets are their homes and families. And that he knew who was and wasn't going to hell. He was always so smug about people being in hell. One day he had the nerve to say that my very devout but liberal great uncle who had just passed away ""didn't have faith strong enough"" and he didn't outright say it, but he attempted to imply my sweet uncle was in hell. I flipped shit and told him he was going to hell for thinking he's a prophet and trying to judge. He would always get in everybody's business, then say ""God spoke to me. He told me somebody in here IS IN DANGER OF GOING TO HELL!"" Like, he would beat his fist on his kitchen table and lecture and fake cry for up to 2 hours about this shit. All the while he'd be staring straight at me and I'd just be staring back like üôÉ.  
Shortly before he died, I found out he'd molested his children when they were growing up. Piece of shit."

She divorced my BIL because ""[her] family was perfect in the religion and in all else and [his] family wasn't."" She is narcissistic and has borderline personality disorder, she couldn't see anyway other than her way. It stems from her childhood and is actually sad. She is causing severe trauma to her kids. But I can't get over a Christian woman claiming anybody to be perfect, when the point of Christ's teachings is that no one is perfect. 

Spoiler alert: She left the church. Still traumatizes the kids though :("

The only office he's ever held is the highest-ranked and only member of a special district in his extremely rural panhandle town.

The worst part is he's a terrible liar. He then made a tik tok account (he throws it back quite horribly) and explained that he had depression to cover up his scams? I feel like that's romanticizing mental illnesses, but who knows, it might be true. However he said that Troy Becker was his real name which is completely different from what he was saying before, and imagine being in your mid-twenties and then pretend to be a 16 year old??"
4795,"Once I went to see my undergrad advisor, he was out so I was told to go to the another advisor/professor and I came to her office and she gave me a tip for classes and then I said thank you Ms.Smith

She gives me this look of disgust, and says with such attitude...it‚Äôs DR. Smith

I said my apologies and wished her a good day...but it was my first time meeting her and most smart ppl ever have that ego lol"
4796,"This is a tough one. My close friend in my early 20‚Äôs was a real hustler. We were both into the sneaker/clothing scene. 

He just let it get the best of him. Always would be watching YouTube videos about freemasonry, and all types of esoteric stuff. He was always into the alchemist point of view. He got into gambling. Unfortunate 

At points he was convinced he had ghostwritten some of the biggest songs on the radio etc which were early warning signs ., This friendship effected me and we were negative influences on another.

It all pretty much went off when he vandalized some friends website, slandered his business partner while owning a shop, and went on huge attack of literally everyone on Facebook.

His family was well off and he was diagnosed Bipolar 1 and They had him committed at a hospital. I‚Äôm sure he is out I hope the best for that guy as I haven‚Äôt seen him in 4 years or so likely won‚Äôt see him again.


TLDR: this is ask women. I am a man this was on the front page. My bad . Oh well."
4797,"Careful, her mother is known to stalk r/beautyguruchatter and Reddit in general. She's doxxed someone and threatened legal action and harassed the f outta people online. Scary woman, beware the crazy."
4798,I just went deep into this hole and it was a wild ride. Thank you.
4799,I suspect there are many on YouTube in addition to the one you mentioned... Also Instagram and Facebook.
4800,"I‚Äôm getting big gypsy rose vibes from her and her mom, just substitute the munchausen‚Äôs by proxy for a weird pagaent/modeling mom energy"
4801,One of the videos on her says she‚Äôs a model. She‚Äôs got quite a scary smile and her videos are all over the place.
4802,I looked into this after seeing your comment. So creepy!
4803,"> She crops herself into pictures with celebrities and at big events.  
  
Anna Allen realness."
4804,Shit throw an uncle in there and you have Miranda from Haters Back Off
4805,Sounds sorta similar to Caroline Calloway
4806,I remember that one! Her teeth look like baby teeth that never fell out.
4807,"Reminds me of Julia Zelg, a 24 year old YouTuber whose ~65 year old wife attacks all of her critics on social media, calling them haters, trolls, homophobes, and bots. They were in a Snapchat documentary once and now they think they‚Äôre culturally relevant. No dude, your channel just sucks."
4808,"Dude holy shit I was just watching something about her. She‚Äôs a nutter, her and her mother."
4809,"wow, that was... interesting"
4810,"LOL she only has 5,000 subscribers"
4811,I just watched priminks video on her. It‚Äôs inane!
4812,"Drew Gooden, is that you?"
4813,"I thought she'd be a young teen of around 14 or so, looked her up and apparently she's a grown woman??"
4814,Its possible that because of this post she just might become famous
4815,Do you have a link that kinda has a thread compiling everything? I just briefly watched a video of hers and she seems genuinely nice and is actually decent at makeup. I‚Äôm not trying to rebuke all you‚Äôve said it‚Äôs just not apparent at first glance (at least from the video i skipped around)
4816,I knew a girl like this. She thought she was a magical sorceress in some other dimension. Found out later she had been severally sexually abused as a kid and used it as a coping mechanism during her depersonalizations. Sad as shit.
4817,This is actually a common delusion. I would bet all my money that she has a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia.
4818,"> never stopped believing

wait, up until present day? how long did it continue to your knowledge?"
4819,[removed]
4820,"I know someone like that. She said that she was part of some chosen magical group based on a marking on her palm. 

She‚Äôs schizophrenic who self medicates with weed. Sad."
4821,"Plot twist: He was the real deal. :)

Seriously though, that's a wild story. There's some bizarre people in this world."
4822,wow! all i can figure is that's how the meek and shy ones fulfilled their fantasy of being very special before the internet.
4823,[removed]
4824,But who‚Äôd aspire to that?
4825,Did you ask him to turn poop into wine?
4826,Upvoting for humbleness and also humour.
4827,This reminded me of the scene where thor is being injected with something in the first thor movie
4828,"As a fellow former psych ward patient I think you sound pretty cool. I would probably have tried to talk to you about which Roman Emperor was your dad.

Glad you're doing better now, though.

... okay, was it Nero? It's got to be Nero, right?"
4829,I work in inpatient psych and you would have been one of my favorite patients. Good for you for coming out of that phase and I hope you never have to go back there!
4830,"> I was the daughter of the Roman Emperor

So thats why you were in the psych ward. Too much lead in the water pipes"
4831,I'm so glad you're doing better!
4832,Username checks out!
4833,I once sincerely believed I was Daenerys Targaryen.
4834,"Oh my gosh, I just imagined that and that sounds so funny! I hope your doing ok now! Edit: I actually thought of you wearing those actual capes and crown though! I'm kind of tired, lol!"
4835,You haven't heard from him.....but have you felt his gaze upon you?!?! Lolololol
4836,"> he could make anyone orgasm by just looking at them  
  
Well, did you? üòÇ"
4837,Wtf üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
4838,Probably confusing orgasm with laughter.
4839,The sexual version of Braco
4840,Do you have his number???  Hahahaha.  OMG - that‚Äôs an impressive lie.  Wow.
4841,No way I'd be able to look at him with a straight face after that.
4842,"My mom had bipolar, too! In a particular psychotic episode, she thought Tom Cruise proposed to her through the TV and she had 7 husbands around the world...my poor Dad took it like a champ. She really tried to convince us that a comet was coming to destroy the Earth‚Äîsounded like something from a medieval prophet. She even wrote a book about it...sounds kinda funny, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs not fun to have a psychotic mom :,)"
4843,It‚Äôs so crazy to see the flip side of bipolar. I have bipolar II and it‚Äôs so wild that the flip side causes such an opposite. Mine is just straight depression with the occasion large burst of energy
4844,Damn...
4845,That's a better love story than Twilight
4846,"I did my clinicals as a nursing student in a psychiatric facility and had a similar patient. She was in her 20s, and said she had a 23 year old daughter named Renesmee (like from twilight) and an 18 year old son. She told me that she couldn‚Äôt go outside because Mother Nature was mad at her because she chose to become a vampire instead of a witch."
4847,That wasn't very Beyonce of her...
4848,Miss. Rona is gonna be delighted
4849,"Just reply with ""COVID19"""
4850,"""So, is $200 how much it took to get you to shut up?"" 

/heh"
4851,"Back in high school, I took a picture of myself with a wad of hundreds and made it my kik or whatsapp profile picture. Anyone who knows me obviously knew that I was just joking around. To this day, that‚Äôs the first image that shows up when you google my name rip."
4852,"Abused kids create worlds and characters in which to escape their shitty lives and violent experiences. 

I would create these worlds for myself where I had loving parents  and I didnt live in crushing poverty."
4853,How are you doing now?
4854,"Just because she is ""classically trained"" doesn't mean that she's a professional musician. I've always taken this to mean that they were trained with a particular rigorous educational style, not that they are necessarily good at their instrument."
4855,"I am sorry this is happening to you. I hope the comes home and you get to spend good days together again, soon!"
4856,That‚Äôs tough. I hope she gets good treatment and that you look after yourself as well
4857,That must be very difficult for you.  Best of luck
4858,"It‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôve done some severely cringey shit, too. A decade ago, I took a wrong turn into what looked like a path but turned out to be a dead end and when a security guard asked me where I wanted to go, I pretended not to speak the language. Very. Poorly. Lol. I‚Äôve avoided that street ever since."
4859,"This is really interesting, tells you the story like it‚Äôs fake, but it‚Äôs actually real, that‚Äôs a double delusion I think."
4860,"Woah, this sounds so much like my mom, it's startling. Each time she'd have a fit (not drugs, but paranoid schizophrenia), she'd be naked. Never understood it. And her mouth would foam up like a rabid dog. 

Sorry you went through that, Buddy. Tough shit."
4861,Sounds like meth
4862,"That‚Äôs a very sad case of wasted talent as result of untreated mental illness. It seems like he‚Äôs had brief stints of proper medication and treatment- there were periods of time where he went a while without tweeting anything wild or saying anything crazy and it seemed like he was doing better. It‚Äôs been while since he‚Äôs seemed mentally healthy though and at this point it seems like we‚Äôre seeing more of his bipolar symptoms than we are of his actual personality. Untreated or improperly treated Bipolar I can really fuck a person‚Äôs life up and seem to completely change their personality. If you listen to his first album, The College Dropout, and compare it to later albums like Yeezus, you can really see how much self awareness he lost and how much the disorder took over. He went from rapping about his insecurities to calling himself a god."

4864,[removed]
4865,I think my sister is experiencing something like this. Shes a homeless tweaker dating an abusive gang member. Four kids by age 25 and lost custody of all.  I'm sure in her mind shes the queen of the gang & still beautiful. We keep begging her not to have more babies or to quit the drug use but she just smiles and flips her hair like we cant see what shes doing.
4866,"i've just been across the ocean for you guys, mouth agape, for years. there is no bottom line. what does he have to *do* to make anyone do anything about him?"
4867,"He just said that the ratings for his press conferences for covid 19 were higher than those of The Bachelor. 

He's comparing a global pandemic to a fucking reality tv show. It's literally unreal how insane he is. And just when you think it can't get worse. IT DOES."
4868,"He makes my blood boil so much, he is just beyond belief. There have been a lot of bad political leaders over the decades. He has NOTHING going for him whatsoever. No intelligence, no charm, nothing. Thanks to him our entire generation is going to be studied through the lens of his presidency. I'm not even American, I'm Scottish - our British PM is a useless shithead as well but Trump is on a whole other astral plane.

Anyone who likes him is a HUGE red flag to me. Ginormous. I wouldn't be able to overcome it if one of my friends or someone I met supported him in any capacity."
4869,"My father is a narcissist and the president is like watching my dad be given a major platform.

I hate it."
4870,It's so hard to listen to that guy.
4871,Very much this
4872,"I tell people I don't watch ""Reality TV"". But I sort of do, American politics is much better, it's constantly wondering if I'm actually seeing this crap happen, from George Bush jr shutting himself in that cupboard and Trump, being... himself... I'm starting to wonder if I'm stuck in a Truman Show style Spitting Image rip off!"
4873,Came here to say this
4874,"I live just north of there, and cannot believe how crazy it has been.  Seriously, you can't make stuff like that up, and it just keeps getting crazier!"
4875,"So... To be fair, he's currently the leader of the free world, head of a multinational corporation, and worth billions. That being said, he may be delusional, but I think youd be hard-pressed to find someone of higher status in the world than he."
4876,"I knew a girl like this but we were in elementary school. She said the backstreet boys were her brothers and Britney Spears was her sister, being so young it's weird the only thing I remember about her is how often she talked about these outlandish lies. It's stuck with me for over 20 years! I randomly remembered her and looked her up. She's in jail now. :("
4877,Numerology would be the number lmao it's something to do with astrology. Your name and exact time of birth decide numbers from 1-9 I think and each one has a different meaning. There's a personality number and a life one etc sounds like he payed someone to tell him what it is when you can look it up for free at least nowadays. I wonder if he was trying to have the psychic confirm his fantasies?
4878,Yikes
4879,"I honestly feel really bad for the men who genuinely think women aren't capable of love. There was a whole askmen thread about it last week and it was so ....embarrassing is maybe the word?

Like do you really honestly think that an entire gender who has literally the same dna you have minus one chromosome was somehow tragically born without the ability to feel? 

As a financially and emotionally stable woman who has literally everything I need AND doesn't want kids, I can't even fathom how somebody could be so short sighted to think the *only* thing I want in life is for a man to give me all the things...*I already have?*"
4880,"I've noticed two varieties of this. There's the men who feel inadequate and make up for it by being ""the absolute best who fucken cares"" and use it to one up everyone to feel special. Then there's the egomaniac ""I'm just incredible"" guys who genuinely believe they are just fantastic additions to the planet."
4881,It's hard to set those sort straight because of the fear of being freaking murdered for hurting their feelings. Laugh nod laugh nod NOOOOOPE (zoom).
4882,"I went on a date with a college guy in Virginia who talked about what an intellectual he was and based his whole dating profile around it (this was well before tinder existed) and then whined during the whole drive across town about how inferior this city in Virginia was because its buildings were spread out and it had big parking lots all over, unlike back home in New York where they build vertically instead of horizontally. He apparently had no concept of population density or the cost of building big skyscrapers and parking garages vs small structures that are close to the ground and flat parking lots. He also didn't have a clue how to put on a condom. He pulled it out of the wrapper, completely unrolled it in his hands, and then stretched it by pulling at both ends several times while claiming he was so big that he needed to do this so the condom would fit. For the record, his penis was completely average in size. Even if he had been larger than average, the large guys usually know to bring bigger condoms if that's a necessity instead of doing some kind of weird pre-stretching ritual with a regular sized condom. It was such a bizarre experience."
4883,This.
4884,"Man here-- seems like overcompensation, at least in the very strict context you provided. Men sometimes feel the need to impress on a first date (I mean, if they don't make a good impression, no second date, right?) and go overboard, often becoming condescending. I've done it, I've seen friends do it, many men do this with the best of intentions when they're nervous... Instead of taking it as delusional and grandiose (in this context.... A few months/years down the line is a different issue), try to look past it take it as a sign they like you."
4885,"There was a self-professed ""ladies' man"" in my freshman dorm. He *did* spend a lot of time in the gym, and was pretty stacked for a guy of 5'5"" (that's being generous, he was quite short). He walked and talked like he was God's gift to the female sex.

A friend slept with him. She had to ask him if it was in; she cried later because it was so bad (I guess because of size *and* technique)."
4886,Yikes! I hope D is in a better place now.
4887,">there was a tendency to dismiss the expertise of others and a complete blind spot about their treatment of employees that weren‚Äôt quite so type A.

As a woman who worked in software, this description strikes a strong chord with me. well put."
4888,Engineering firm my ass... You work for NASA don't you
4889,Because most of us haven't personally interacted with the Tiger King guy.
4890,"I've had to limit my news intake to once or twice a day for my mental and emotional health.

It's no secret to anyone around me that I've never liked Trump (even the pre-politician version), but how this has been going is just too much.  Something about the callousness combined with the stupidity just sets me off.  I'm not sure I've ever been so furious in my life as I've been hearing him claim hospitals don't need what they're requesting, suggesting that doctors are hording masks, or wanting to reopen everything in a couple weeks because ""the economy!"""
4891,My son thinks something similar. Do you have any insight into why your mind chose this particular delusion? So many delusions seem to involve working for the government...
4892,Umm wtf what made her think that?
4893,but that could also be seen as funny  ?
4894,"I ALMOST JUST FELL OFF MY CHAIR.  I used to live near him, he would walk around his apt hyping himself up and making videos 24/7."

4898,Well I guess the crazy doesn't fall far from the crazy tree
4899,How in the hell is she going to dox somebody and threaten legal actions against them?

4902,How old is she? I was curious and she looks like a preteen or maybe hs freshman.
4903,üòÇ she does remind me of Miranda
4904,"I watched their doco the other day, I didn't realise the older wife was so aggressive. I bet they do get a lot of gross comments though."
4905,"Yup she‚Äôs 18! She was apparently homeschooled so her only example was her mother, who‚Äôs just as crazy. She‚Äôs still very childlike."
4906,"Nah.

People started calling her out last summer. The most popular expose video about her is approaching 3.5 million views and her social media stats have barely blipped. If she was gonna gain an ironic/viral following from people gossiping about her, it would have happened already."
4907,"Infamous maybe, she lacks any real skill to maintain a following."
4908,"There‚Äôs a YouTube channel called Primink, I watched a video about her on there. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IHifwwHVdUw"
4909,"I get what you mean, but if you really think about it, how can you tell if someone is genuinely nice from watching edited footage of them talking into a camera about makeup?"
4910,Oof. That took a terrible turn.

4912,"She was heavily medicated for chronic depression. The kicker? Her *psychiatrist* suggested that she read up on astral projection to see if her experiences match it. That psychiatrist (who saw her after her suicide attempt) is responsible for so much harm in that girl‚Äôs life, I can‚Äôt believe she still has her license. 

Several people pointed out that she might be hallucinating/lucid dreaming etc. but her response was always ‚ÄûI was on anti-hallucinogens so wouldn‚Äôt the astral visits have stopped if they were only hallucinations?‚Äú

It‚Äôs been getting worse in the past six years. Before, she was able to contact her astral husband only during her astral projection sessions - now, she claims to hear and feel him during her waking hours, too. She also has more spirits that she communicates with, and an astral baby. Meanwhile, in reality she is alone and living with her parents after having dropped out of community college and a failed stint as a model."

I'm a history major (it's just a bachelor's) and it's a subject I read and think about often, so it's no doubt rooted in that. It was just my brain short circuiting on me, lol.

I have been doing a lot better over the past two years or so. I hope the same is the case for you!

Also thank you to all y'all for giving me those points and the award. That was really cute, I appreciate it."

I remember being confused as a kid because I knew I was supposed to listen to what my mom said but I also knew it was straight up insane. It causes a lot of internal conflict and sometimes ends up making you feel like you have to take care of your parent."

Nobody else at his 'level' thinks he's worth anything, that to me says more than the stanning from a bunch of people who want a licence to be openly racist again."

4980,"Believe me, men tend to be acutely aware of what society expects out of them (or some seriously warped version thereof) and some men react to this differently than others. It's not ALWAYS insecurity. See my response below.

4981,"I'm not really implying anything beyond what was stated outright. All I said was take it as a sign they like you. Beyond that, it's your call. 

To address what you and many other people are questioning, the men who do this (contextually, on a first/early date) tend to lack self-awareness to a debilitating degree. They may not be the person they're making themselves out to be to you. They might be completely unaware of how they're coming off... Signals getting lost in translation, if you will. 

I'm not saying they're definitely not that person, I'm saying sometimes there's a chance they aren't. Depends on the person, the severity of their tone, and in all honesty, your personality.  Could be a red flag, could be first date jitters, could be you reading into things too much. The world isn't black and white. It's a judgment call. 

Apparently people missed the meaning behind my caveat of ""a few months/years down the line is a different issue."" If you look past it early on but they continue the behavior, definitely ditch them. At that point, it's probably severe mental illness."

And then add in the crimes, the bankruptcies, the scandals, the adultery, the multiple marriages, the rape allegations, the fifteen year friendship with a human trafficker., the shady financial connections with enemy states... just change his skin color and his family's skin color.

4998,"And that causes insecurity because we shouldn't (and can't) have to conform to society's standards.

As a woman I know exactly how I should look and act according to society. Problem is I can't look like that without some plastic surgery and I shouldn't have to change myself to fit others standards. When I was younger I was insecure because my personality and looks don't conform to all standards but as I get older I care less and therefore I'm less insecure.

Don't get me wrong, I feel for anyone who feels bad or like they have to change themself because society wouldn't deem them enough. However, I think any adult needs to have the maturity to take those feelings and work through them."

Yes, they've done very good things that have had genuine effects on improving peoples lives- but I think between them, corporate media, and the way things function in the US compared to the rest of the world demonstrate that there is something very very broken about the US's problem's and the best representation of that is that Trump is a symptom, not the cause of this. Like OP said, there is no bottom line, because the social norms and infrastructure, and competence has been whittled out from the bottom up for years."
5006,I also always want to know if they're aware of how to reciprocate that sort of interaction. I've met plenty of men who open up to me and ask for emotional support but then outright refuse to provide that same support to me.

5012,"The only thing that gives me hope is having known so many immigrants and knowing what so many have gone through in the past to make America the land of their hearts. The neighborhood I grew up in was largely immigrant. Lots of side hustle, lots of business hustle. It's given me zero tolerance for the whining and the flailing of these hate-filled lumps. 

If we can just pry the reins of power from the people who think this country is great only IF we keep ""those people"" out, maybe we can be worthy of the dream. The idea of a national identity that is not rooted in blood or family name but in a sense of shared grit and a whole bucket of sweat... that's something worth loving. 

Those lumps are unworthy of it. Not to sound cheesy or anything, but the classic line says it all:

The study was hard as I had a long absence from the workforce to raise a family but it was very rewarding and I've never looked back.  Being a woman has been a plus as many companies are keen to employ women in IT (even though they won't officially admit it).  I have been told this by a few mangers I have worked for."
5017,"I changed careers in my 40s. I knew for a long time that I wanted a change, but it took me several years of flailing around to settle on what to do next.

I spent a lot of time doing research into possible second careers and taking classes in fields that interested me. I seriously considered taking over my mother's small business for awhile. But I just couldn't settle on anything.

Eventually, I was so burned out and frustrated that I just quit my job. My hope was that the time off would help me get my head together and choose a new career. Thank goodness, it did:

I'd always loved to write when I was a kid, and had briefly considered majoring in English in high school, before I got an economic reality check. So, maybe dust off that old love? A creative writing class turned out to be a disappointment, a technical writing class proved the perfect combo of old love and experience from my first career as a software developer. 

I went back to work 30 hours/week (benefits, you know) as a developer, while working on a certificate in technical communications. When I finished my certificate, I was lucky enough to fall into a full-time tech writing job via a writer I'd previously worked with. Networking is THE way to go when it comes to finding jobs.

I'm retired now, but I truly loved my second career as a writer. I only wish I'd made the switch sooner."
5018,"Recently I was been accepted into the apprentice program at Forbidden School of Body Art & Tattoo! My wife and I are moving to Portland, OR in April and my apprenticeship begins the following May.

This represents an opportunity to explore a life long goal. I caught the tattoo bug as a teenager, when a coworker of my mother‚Äôs saw a drawing of mine, and asked if he could get a copy to have it tattooed. In my early 20‚Äôs, growing up in San Luis Obispo, CA, the opportunities weren‚Äôt at my disposal in order to pursue an apprenticeship. There were only a few studios in the area, I wasn‚Äôt involved in the community, and to be completely honest: my portfolio was unfocused and unpolished. I was working full time to support myself, barely making ends meet on a monthly basis, so even if I had an apprenticeship offer, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to take it.

At the time, I had thought momentarily about getting machines and researching/teaching myself from online materials. However, I respected the art too much to pursue it in this way. Also, the thought of ‚Äúscratching‚Äù on myself and my friends (who were eager to offer their flesh) just didn‚Äôt sit well. In my opinion the living canvas: skin, is the most complex medium possible, and it would be arrogant to assume I could teach myself how to do it well without the proper tutelage. So, I put tattooing aside in my mind, and focused on my professional progress through the tech sector.

The better part of a decade later, in the fall of 2016, I found myself at a cross roads in my career path, and I chose to leave the tech world. My plan was to live on savings for a couple of years (what I call my midlife retirement), and return to my passion: drawing. New experiences have always fueled my creativity, so I traveled, explored, adventured, and each time returned to my pencil and paper. At the time I didn‚Äôt have an end goal in mind professionally. My hope was that at the end of the midlife retirement, with a new body of work, I would know what to do next.

As 2018 approached, I felt my midlife retirement coming to an end, and I didn‚Äôt have my next step as a professional artist in sight. My wife and I had made plans to move to Portland, OR when our lease ends in May. I found myself mentally preparing to return to the tech sector. I updated my linkedin, my website portfolio, and began to put feelers out for potential opportunities. The closer I became to following this career path, the larger the sinking feeling became in the pit of my stomach. I believed in my art, and I knew it hadn‚Äôt been just a phase before resuming my unsatisfying career.

As fate would have it, my career epiphany was found entirely by chance at the bottom of our fifth or sixth mimosa. Over brunch, and discussing all the excitement regarding my wife and I moving to Portland, my friend recalled getting her most recent tattoo the last time she was in Portland at Forbidden School Body Art & Tattoo. Inception was complete, and the thought was a spark that set my mind aflame. I returned to a thought I hadn‚Äôt revisited since my early 20‚Äôs: that I could be a professional tattoo artist. It just made complete sense. By the time I got home that night there wasn‚Äôt a doubt in my mind that I had found my next step.

I was stoked to learn that Oregon is one of the most strict licensing states in the country. In order to be licensed you must either provide proof that you‚Äôre already a licensed tattoo artist from out of state (providing 3 years of W-2‚Äôs) or attend a state approved school that has curriculum requirements defined by the state: 360 hours of training (210 theory/150 practical), chairside supervision under a licensed tattoo artist. Must have documentation showing a minimum of 50 completed procedures (which means ‚Äúa tattoo that has been finished, including any touchups or additional work following initial healing and the client is released from service‚Äù). Training must be conducted by an Oregon licensed tattoo artist registered as a teacher by the Higher Education Coordinating Commission‚Äôs Private Career Schools division.

That night I contacted the school, submitted my portfolio, my artistic statement, and hoped.

Over the next couple of days, everything fell into place. They loved my portfolio, my professional history, and my goals for being an artist and interest in the industry. They were accepting two students for enrollment starting in May 2018, which was perfectly in line with when we had planned to move to the area. After graduation, they offer you space in their studio, but also encourage and understand if you want to pursue opportunities at other studios. Their instructors are working artists themselves, and their work is exciting and in line stylistically with what I want to pursue as a tattoo artist.
I‚Äôm so grateful for how everything has come together. My work over the last year has enabled me to unlock an opportunity that I had previously thought impossible. For the first time in my life, I won‚Äôt be just working for a living, I‚Äôll be following my passion. I‚Äôll be a professional artist."
5019,"Not sure if 30-ish is midlife, but for almost 10 years I was self-employed artist. Then I decided I want to try ""normal"" employment. 

In my first job, I found out by sheer luck/accident that ""being able to talk to both programmers and clients + love of problem solving"" are skills needed for a position called ""project manager"". So within few months I went from webmaster to project manager position. Later I switched to a different employer and now I work as IT project manager in IT/creative agency."

If you don't have a technical background in whatever domain you choose to write in, you'll probably want to do some beefing up, there, too. 

For me, that part was straightforward since I was writing for people who did what I used to do (software development). What I most needed was guidance on proper technical writing. I definitely found out through classes that I didn't know as much as I thought.

So I'd probably try to move back around the area that would become my hometown (still tiny villages and hamlets back then), set myself up somewhere relatively secluded and out of the way and pray I don't get sick because then I'd be dead lol.  
  
And maybe try and find my ancestors, out of curiosity. My grandma was born in 1920 so maybe my great-grandparents?"
5061,Why would I want to go backward??? To watch how horrible we have been treated??
5062,Find my own Jamie Fraser and that's the end haha
5063,Probably shortly die of smallpox.
5064,"I will throw myself off a cliff to speed up the dying



No asthma meds back then. It must be nice to be able bodied."
5065,I'm pretty sure I'd just panic trying to figure out how to get back and end up in some kind of insane asylum.
5066,"I love your plan. So many people immediately think ‚ÄúModern women would be burned as witches because they are educated and  practice feminism‚Äù while forgetting that educated women existed who researched and created. We don‚Äôt learn about them because men (their husbands, coworkers, and bosses) often took credit for their work but they still exist."
5067,Completely. I wouldn‚Äôt want to live in any time where I didn‚Äôt have voting rights or a polio vaccine. So post 1950s for me
5068,You got me. I‚Äôve been re watching Outlander.
5069,"Yeah, you could go back centuries and still live fairly well, if not for a lack of autonomy. A lot depends on social/economic status and just what period you were living in. Greeks and Romans treated their women very well. Much better than many later civilizations did. And if you were born a wealthy daughter in most civilizations, you'd receive a proper education. You could pursue a number of interests, from the the arts, to studying and research. Of course, a lot was expected of you in who you'd marry."
5070,It really does get you thinking on that topic!  I was majorly second-guessing her trip back in Book 3. She could have planned so much better!
5071,I feel isolated because I broke away from a close group of friends who were toxic and never looked out for me and my best interests. I got two new cats to keep my occupied but at the moment I feel really jaded about life. I took the leap to make the fresh start and cut ties but it's difficult when you're on your own.
5072,"I quit my job and was funemployed for while, moved to a new country. 

And .. then . .I moved back. Because living abroad didn't work out so well for me. I moved back to a different US city, got kick-ass job, joined a bunch of meetup.com groups where I made several new friends, found exercise classes I liked, and eventually met the love of my life .

However, I can't necessarily recommend this course of action for others. I have a friend who also did the same thing, inspired my by success!  Except she ended up unemployed long-term, no dating life, no good job, and no (new) friends.

The difference between the 2 of us is that I had no expectations. I knew I was taking a risk and could end up having to downgrade my job in order to get back into the workplace. I didn't have to end up doing that, but I was prepared for it. I was also prepared that I might not meet any new friends or have much of a dating life. I accepted these risks and decided I still wanted a chance to start my life anew. My friend had crazy high expectations for herself and I can't help but think that might have been her downfall."
5073,"I just moved to a new city and started doing what I wanted to do instead of what other people thought I should be doing. It hasn't been easy and this stupid virus has made things 100% more difficult, but it will be worth it in the end."
5074,"I think you have to be really intentional and assertive about claiming that new life. Go on bumble for BFF and reach out to all the people who seem interested. Don't take it personal if a new friendship fails to materialize. Go to classes, workshops, try new things, eat new foods. If you want to change your life and be a new you it must be through action and choice."
5075,I moved back to my hometown and reconnected with old friends and old hobbies. So I guess I found the old me.
5076,"I was a boring, lazy, divorced drunk in a toxic relationship with a post-divorce rebound.

4 years ago I impulsively decided to move to a different city and ditch the rebound.  I joined the local climbing gym (having never been active in my entire life), started working out, eating better. It took 6 months for me to make friends but the wait was worth it. These people are the best people I have ever known, climbing and strength training are my life. I went vegan and decided to go back to school for Sports Nutrition. 

I am totally in love with the life I have built for myself over the past 4 years."
5077,"Aww crap!  I was supposed to get NEW friends?   My bad.  I just let go of all my old toxic friends and moved on with my life.  I have the hubby, kids, family, but no friends bringing drama and shit into my life and draining me of energy.  I feel free"
5078,"School, jobs, volunteering, tinder, also Bumble BFF is a thing!"
5079,"I left everything and everyone behind, moved across the planet and let extroversion take its course. I'd say that I was fully settled into a new network and into my new life about two years down the track. Best Thing Ever."
5080,"I dont trust anybody so making friends is not a priority for me. However, I will say that I found a new me by letting go of toxicity and truly working on myself and praying everyday."
5081,"In the gym I found a new me, friends and positive things followed that."
5082,"Bars, tinder. Bars had a lot of cool people I still talk to today lol"
5083,AA
5084,I quit smoking up because it made me anxious and all my previous friends did was get high and judge me. I found friends who i could go on lunches and dinners and do movie dates with and not sit in a room baked having nothing better to do. It was hard fitting in with people like that but i‚Äôve always had an easy approach so it wasn‚Äôt hard for me to blend in and start my social life all over again. What was hard was feeling left out in the beginning of it but i‚Äôm proud of myself for having so much patience to have let go of the toxic people i called my friends and have started doing positively fun things that i‚Äôll actually remember rather than those blurry days i‚Äôd waste sleeping while being high
5085,"I was in a really bad mental state freshman year of college, and I had shit friends that only wanted me to do stuff for them (homework, lend clothes, etc.). They never once checked on me or even talked to me unless they needed something. And yes, now that I say it out loud they were not my friends at all lol. But I dropped all of them, deleted their numbers and when I saw them on campus I acted like they never existed until they got the point. I then took a leap of faith, applied at a super coveted job on campus and I actually got it. Not only did I now have money, which relived a lot of stress, I was out of my comfort zone and meeting new people, some of which are my best friends. They encouraged me to get help for myself and my mental health, and all of my relationships are healthy now, even with my parents. I started back doing things that I enjoy like painting, hiking, yoga, sewing, etc. Dropping the toxic people from my life definitely changed everything for the better."
5086,"I started to tell the people who told me to fuck off they could fuck off too. They stopped talking to me (I'm the nice shy person who wouldn't even say a bad word). I sticked to the only person who was nice to me, moved from home and stoped talking to my (abusive) family. I now live with my boyfriend, I cut my hair and gaind weight I'm happy ‚ù§Ô∏è."
5087,At a new job.
5088,I went to work in a hostel far far away. My new friends are mostly backpackers.
5089,"Pole dancing.

Did wonders for me in so many ways."
5090,Pole dancing class! Seriously the best friends I've ever had in my life. For me it was a way to own my sexuality without needing a guy and I ended up finding a sisterhood of the best women I'll ever know.
5091,"I'm in my early 40s so with about 20 years experience, I can tell you that no matter what your ex's do (and you will probably have many more of them), the way you get over these types of things are simply time and distance. Sometimes, like you experienced, distance isn't always up to you but no matter what time will continue on and little by little, it will get easier and easier to accept that it's over.

And no matter how similar you think this girl is to you, she's not you, she has a whole other past, a whole other present and an entirely different life then you. And she probably has really bad breath...so maybe that's the variety he was looking for, bad breath? Seriously, if the Tinder guys seem nice and you are staying safe, go out with them. If you break into tears and only talk about Kevin the whole night, well you still had a date right and the next one will be easier.

And I'm sorry but I'm laughing so hard at the thought of your dad actually calling your ex and his new date over to your table. My dad would have done the exact same thing."
5092,"The internet - researched things that interested me
Fitness studios - started practicing yoga, which I was interested in 
More studios - signed up for a dance class that was being advertised on the bulletin board"
5093,"I went to therapy, started culling toxic people, figured out what my ideal me looked like, and everything I did next was in service to that image."
5094,I change my wardrobe generally. Last decade has been a constant change as it is. School then University then Job- all in different cities. Maybe now I'd switch jobs and cities if I want a change.
5095,"Meetup.com 
I also reconnected with old friends."
5096,"Reconnecting with old non-toxic friends and livingsocial/Groupon. I used livingsocial/Groupon to try new things cheaper that I wouldn't have tried otherwise. I ended up loving the pole dance classes I took, so I've continued to do that and have made a truly wonderful group of friends as a result."
5097,"I didn't necessarily change my life but I did make some new friends and focus on my health and well-being by taking studio exercise and yoga classes. I go to two different studios and I've made acquaintances at both. I usually go right after work so it's a nice transition and it breaks up my day so I don't feel like I spent my entire day making money for someone else. It's helped me become more independent and focused on myself whole inviting new ideas and people into my life. It's been a little over a year since I started. My state is in lockdown so I can't physically go into the studio right now, but they both offer virtual classes so I'm sticking to it."
5098,"My early teenage life was basically completely devastated by this extremely toxic friend I had. They had no respect for me and treated me like a real piece of garbage. One day when they were throwing their usual bullshit at me, I threw it right back at them and all the anger that had been built up over the 4 years. They couldn‚Äôt even fight back because everything was right. Throughout those years, extreme anxiety had built up within me but I‚Äôd had enough. 

I moved to a new school and picked up the courage to talk to people first and I‚Äôve made the bestest friends I could‚Äôve ever asked for and I can really say that it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve felt genuine happiness in many years. I didn‚Äôt know I could feel this way.

Because of covid-19, we‚Äôve also been forced out of school for our safety. Though our final exams have been cancelled and all of us are worrying about university, the sudden goodbyes gave me an opportunity to reach out to many of the people who I didn‚Äôt talk to much and I‚Äôve made many good friends even after leaving school. 

I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôm a very happy person now :)"
5099,"I was in an abusive relationship from 16-19 years old. When my brother learned about this he offered me a flight to California where we lived (we‚Äôre from Canada but we have dual citizenship in the US). I got a job at a hostel and I lived and worked there for three years. I never looked back. It was the single greatest decision I‚Äôve ever made and I‚Äôm eternally grateful to my brother for extending the offer. It took me a long time to get on my feet, a lot of years of being pretty broke. But that didn‚Äôt stop me from having fun, learning, and appreciating every day for what it was. I felt like, and to this day (that was 11 years ago), each day is an adventure. It‚Äôs a vacation. It‚Äôs my life and claiming control of that changed me forever. I have the confidence to take on any form this life offers me, and that‚Äôs the true gift in all of this. Sell your things, they really don‚Äôt matter. From my experience, I can say with 100% confidence that a hostel is your friend when trying a new city. Automatic friends who are all traveling too, so there‚Äôs a sense of adventure for everyone. And there are very little moments of that ‚Äúnew person‚Äù awkwardness because the lot of people you‚Äôll meet have no time for polite chit chat. They will know the best places in the city to eat the best foods for a cheap price. And you might even find housing through them too. Don‚Äôt worry about age, when I was 19 some of my best friends there were 30-40, they all looked out for me. Just go and trust yourself. Trust the universe to keep you safe and have fun with your life.

Edit: just to be clear about where I am now! I realized I only explained my first few years after moving. I‚Äôm 30 yrs old now, engaged to the best person on the planet (getting married next August). We travel as much as we can and when we‚Äôre home we operate three vacation rentals in town and are opening a restaurant/bar this coming fall. I made my living before this as an corporate event coordinator for some high profile night clubs in the city, as well as a side business creating catering programs for small businesses. I have made countless friends in this adventure and am always making new meaningful connections. I think that‚Äôs something I learned early on after living amongst so many people. How to weed out the bad ones and learn how to truly connect with kindred spirits.

Best of luck to you!! And any of the strong women on this forum looking for a new chapter in your life. Amazing things will happen for you, I can promise you that!"
5100,"When I went to college. I went to a school located about an hour and a half from my hometown. I made a lot of new friends, got into fitness and really grew as a person."
5101,"When I lived with my mom and stepdad, there was endless emotional abuse. Endless gaslighting. They compared me to my siblings all the time and would tell me that I was meant to be aborted or that I was an accident. It may have been true but the way that they would phrase it really hurt me. I got tired of it and reached out to my biological dad when I turned 16. I started visiting and getting weekends with him. That‚Äôs when I realized how bad the abuse actually was, so I moved in with him. I changed schools and everything. I kept a couple of friends from when I lived with my mom because they saw through my parents‚Äô bullshit and they helped me through every step of the way. It was definitely a shock in terms of ‚Äúholy shit this is my new reality and I don‚Äôt have to flinch every time my dad comes in my room‚Äù I confided in my old friends and they encouraged me to find new friends at my new school so I wouldn‚Äôt spiral into a depression. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a brand new start, brand new me, but I‚Äôm definitely different from my old self. Now that I‚Äôm 18 and I‚Äôve been through a lot in terms of growing up, I can say that reaching out to new people like my friends keep telling me to do is helping."
5102,Meetup :) but like everything else in life you get out of it what you put in.
5103,I started joining multiple clubs. I remember going to 6 callouts in a week on anything that sounded interesting. I‚Äôve only stayed active in 3 but I grew my circle of friends and now get to do things I enjoy
5104,"Got a new job. Luckily I got a good one and made new friends there.

Met my SO, outside of work and he introduced me to alot of healthy active hobbies."
5105,I went to college. Left all my fake annoying friends and had a chance to get out of my toxic home... at least for a while until I had to come back home due to COVID-19.
5106,"not judging yourself and going with the flow. and if something sounded like it could be good, i did it. i found new friends by becoming a regular and being social. this is probably one of my best qualities - i can talk to anyone because it's easy for me to find commonality.  

a ""new you"" could be harder depending on your route. my ""new me"" involves analyzing my thoughts, understanding my triggers, and working on things that i'm struggling with. the idea is that once you get to know who you are, it'll be easier to figure out what you want."
5107,Unfortunately not able to yet... wanted/still want a fresh start from someone specific in my life but they‚Äôre tied to much to other friends in my life they if I cut them out it makes it awkward for everyone else! Hopes are to just drift away slowly! But I found making new friends at school has helped me drift
5108,"I‚Äôm in the same position as you (except replace cats with houseplants). More power to you! It‚Äôs a slow process, but for me being 3 months, almost 4 out of that situation, I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve ever been. 

There are days if I wonder if I made the right choice, but then I remember how many people there will be in the future to cross my path, and I get so genuinely excited. 

Hold your own, remember your boundaries and your needs when it comes to relationships. And the best of luck to you!"
5109,"I've been in a similar place, but it is so much better to take the time to find good friends than to sit with toxic friends for the safety of a pack. I hope this isn't weird to say but I'm proud of you for taking that leap--it's not easy. New friends will come into your life and things will get better. You already have two cats for starters! Wishing you the best :-)"
5110,"This is a great point, glad it worked out in the end for you. I know a few stories like this myself, one acquaintance moved to start a new life and ended up just draining her savings. She wasn't foolish and actually spoke the language of the country she moved to pretty well but she had no connections and found it hard to find a job, much less the job she really wanted. She did find love and some friends in the other immigrants of said city but quickly realized she couldn't sustain herself unless she got a local education. So she applied for some schools, got in, realized that programme wasn't for her after studying for a semester. So she moved back home. It's just incredibly difficult to start over in a new country without any connections or a very stellar education/career prospects."
5111,goals.
5112,how did you decide what city to move to?
5113,">My friend had crazy high expectations for herself and I can't help but think that might have been her downfall.

thanks for that paragraph. 

how so? could you elaborate?"
5114,I‚Äôm in the same boat- new city and all. It‚Äôs freeing to live the life you want to live but it does take time. It‚Äôs a good reminder to do one small thing a day to put yourself on the right track to combat the obstacle of rebuilding can be overwhelming. You‚Äôre right. It will be worth it end the end!
5115,I second Bumble BFF. I met some of my best friends on there when I moved to a new country. It can totally work if you keep an open mind!
5116,I was just about to join a climbing/bouldering gym before this virus hit. Gives me something to look forward to!
5117,"Yes climbing!! Such an amazing community. Woohoo, good for you"
5118,i did this but without the husband kids and family.
5119,It is so empowering to quit something that is not good for you! Good job.
5120,"Yes. I did the same thing! Life changing experience, I don‚Äôt regret a minute."
5121,Your comment means so much. It is hitting me at the moment because of how toxic social media can be and with this quarantine everyone looks packed up and cliqued up and I feel like an outer like a leper. I'm moving forward so that's all that matters.
5122,"1. It had many jobs in my industry. Not as many as the city I left, but there were jobs. 
2. The weather and the vibe are more ""me"" 
3. I had a relative whom I could stay with while I was applying for jobs so that I didn't have to sign a lease until I had accepted a job offer."
5123,"Oh, it's hard to explain but I'll try. When I thought about getting my first job after being unemployed for awhile, I looked at the whole package -- ""is there growth at this company? Do I like what this company does? Do I believe in the company mission? Do I like my coworkers? Do I like my boss?"" and if I could answer ""yes"" to all of these, I could lower my expectation for pay and for the title of the role. Obviously I wasn't going to aim for a low salary or low title, but if i had to sacrifice those things for all of those ""yeses"" I would consider it.  I researched the FUCK out of every company I interviewed for (I'm talking 5 pages singe-spaced of handwritten notes that I had made while reading about them, anticipating every question I could think of, etc). I kept my expectations low -- I had a 1.5yr gap on my resume so people might not be clamoring to hire me. 

My friend wanted to pick up exactly where she left off when she quit her job. She wanted the title and cared so much about the title and the image of the job that it blinded her to some huge red flags about the roles she was interviewing for and the ill-fated positions she ultimately ended up in. She didn't research the company or her coworkers or anything -- all she looked at was ""ooh, fancy title!"" 

Additionally, I saw her apply these super high expectations to the guys she was meeting and the potential friends she met. And it just kind of sours things if you have crazy expectations for someone on a 1st date, or a 2nd date, or a 3rd date. Or you expect someone to be your best friend after you go to 2 happy hours with them.  

And all of these things made her make quick, rash decisions about her life without thinking them over. 

Now, I fully admit there was some luck in my life, no doubt about that, but I do think my expectations played into that luck a little bit.

**tl;dr: I aimed for lower, less-prestigious positions at better, more stable companies. She aimed for high positions at unstable and shitty companies.**"
5124,Us girls should always empower each other more‚ù§Ô∏è
5125,Good reasons.
5126,Thanks for the write up and advice! It‚Äôs good to be reminded that job title isn‚Äôt everything.
5127,"I'll give you some advice that has guided me for the past 15 years: When it comes to a job, there are really only 3 things that matter: 

1. Your salary -- without a bonus, stock options, etc that can all be taken away from you or plummet to nothing, what are you making in 1yr that can't be taken away from you? 

2. Your boss -- does your boss look out for you? Your direct boss is the one person who is 90% responsible for getting you promoted or raises or recognition. If they aren't looking out for you, there is no hope for you at this company. 

3. Your average, daily work. What does an average day look like for you? Sure, we all have to pull a 12hr day sometimes or do some work on the weekend or deal with a difficult person occasionally, but on an *average* day are you happy with your job hours/work assignments/projects? Or are you slammed, stressed, zero work/life balance, treated like crap by your coworkers?

In my experience, if any of those 3 things are bad, you're fucked and need to get out now.No fancy title or big paycheck is going to make up for a shitty boss or shitty work hours and utter lack of work/life balance. 

Obviously there are some exceptions here -- like if you're aiming to be partner at a law firm or you're a medical resident then you just need to eat those shitty 15hr days and there's nothing you can do about it, but for your average job, this angle is pretty accurate."
5128,"that's another great write up. i'd add a 4th point that i feel isn't talked about as much. 

is the work that you're doing moving you towards or away from your goals?

it's important to live life in harmony (finances, career, hobbies, family, partner etc.) - knowing where you stand in all of the major categories now and how you want to improve each category, and if the goals for each category aligns overall. not doing this means that you make decisions that don't support your needs and wants. 

i feel like as an adult you're expected to ""know yourself"". it seems to be a given. but i've met a lot of people and while outwardly they may look like they know themselves, in reality they don't. you can tell when they make decisions that don't support their well being or have odd reactions to mundane situations. 

maybe that's a lot to ask of people? it's certainly been difficult on my end to achieve this."
5129,"I'm meeting my goals. I have a job in an interesting field with decent pay, good benefits, and great work/life balance (I rarely work outside of the hours M-F 9am-6pm) 

At some point I'd like a promotion or 2, sometime in the next 10yrs. And a cost of living raise every year, but a COL raise is pretty standard at the company I'm at unless you are doing really bad."
5130,Lol love this
5131,Ich dachte erst es ginge um das Getr√§nk... ':-D
5132,"I'm thinking maybe a little tail-sleeve, open at the end."
5133,"Sticking out, for balance purposes. It would be weird to have a tail swishing around in one pant leg all day."
5134,I assume if humans had tails they'd be for balance purposes and would therefore be left sticking out.
5135,Covered in clothing? It would be so revealing in print in the back of your ass lol.
5136,"Either, like arms and legs."
5137,"Sticking out, for balance. It would also be interesting to accessorize them."
5138,It depends on what purpose the tails serve. Balance? Prehensile? Probably also on the climate/temperature.
5139,how big is this tail???
5140,Sticking out like Goku's does in Dragon Ball :D
5141,Swish out. Like Mewtwo
5142,"Sticking out, no question."
5143,"Sticking out in general, but I‚Äôd imagine a lot of knit-wear fashion surrounding it.  
Also safety gear.  
All the piercings!"
5144,Sticking out!  If it was inside the clothes it would make our butts look funny!
5145,Sticking out bc I can't imagine touching it being comfortable since it'll have bones
5146,"There would probably be a vast cultural divide between cultures. There is a good chance that they would be cut off by many cultures. Tails would probably be at the center of massive human rights debates: do parents have the right to cut off their babies tails as an infant, or do infants have the right to grow up with tails? If they were too cumbersome, it could be made to be a requirement that you remove your tail for certain professions. As to how clothing would work with them: the flexibility at the base would probably massively determine clothing standards. If it is stiff, clothing would probably HAVE to be made to accommodate tails. Even if tails could be tucked in your pants, and/or, say, rolled up along a leg, or around your belly, it would possibly cause a lot of chaffing. Seats would all also be designed to give room for tails. Like, obviously a desk chair would be fine, but sofas would be either completely out, or they would have to be designed with gaps. There would probably also be a lot of shit like tail dyeing, tail piercing, and shaved tail patterns, etc."
5147,"It will only be covered if it differs between gender, just like penis vs vagina and man boob vs woman boob"
5148,"Sticking out! I can see them being used for balance and kind of like a third arm. I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôd be long and have hair like we have on our head. And people would be stylish with them, cut the hair, dye the hair, accessorize the hair. 
Somehow when I read the question I immediately imagined a tall dark skinned woman with sharp, green eyes. Wearing a violet silky dress. Long black voluminous hair and her tail had long black voluminous hair as well. Gorgeous."
5149,Let's say between 1-2 feet
5150,yeah that thing is not fitting in my skinny jeans
5151,"Mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and chocolate ice cream."
5152,yes
5153,Alcohol. Ugh.
5154,What *aren't* I comfort eating. Pretty much just the cheesecake I've been craving but I don't feel comfortable getting on public transit to go get. Everything within walking distance of my apartment is in my stomach.
5155,It's hot cross bun season.
5156,"Anything and everything within reach :(  


I wish I had gotten more girl scout cookies before they stopped selling for the year. I'm having the worst cravings ever."
5157,"Whatever is left. 

I typically have a very healthy diet.

My standards havr plummeted dramatically."
5158,Grapes.... Fermented.... And bottled
5159,Another vote for cheese. (And white cheddar cheezit crackers). Comfort drink? Wine or hot tea.
5160,"The restaurant that I work at had to close temporarily so there was a free-for-all on all the perishables. I absolutely love goat cheese and there happened to be a mostly-full 4 lb. tub of goat cheese that was going to be thrown away.... so, long story short, a lot of goat cheese"
5161,"challah bread string cheese & salami  
on repeat"
5162,Cake & Wine.
5163,"Chips.

Chocolate."
5164,"I‚Äôve been baking *a lot* but I prefer the dough over the actual baked goods, so I split the batter in half... half gets baked for my husband, the other half is stored in the freezer for me to snack on"
5165,Cake is a food group. Happy birthday to me.
5166,Today was Annies Mac & Cheese with extra butter and shredded cheese. Yesterday was Hint of Lime Tostitos. The day before that was brownies... I made bread earlier in the week that we demolished within hours (instead of having with breakfast the next day). Also wine. Lots and lots of wine.
5167,Cheese

5479,I got 3 flavors of chocolate chips for baking. Hoping they last until I get around to baking.

5491,All the Oreos
5492,"I'm gonna have to go with banana bread, because I decided to start using up my frozen bananas, and have way more than I thought. So for a family of four, we're going through two loaves per week so far."
5493,"GIRL. Everything and between that and the constant stress my tummy is not pleased with me about any of it. I ran out of vegan ice cream and couldn't justify a trip to the store to get more, so I've been making like a soft serve type thing by blending frozen bananas.

Anyone else restoring to healthier stuff as their body rebels from being under constant duress?"

5518,Yes
5519,I was doing okay until I lost my job now I‚Äôm really getting though that backlog of my wine of the month bottles.
5520,"Right now I'm recovering from coronavirus and severe bronchitis but holy cow I can hardly express how much I'm looking forward to getting started on excessive drinking. I mean I would totally start now except I'm guessing it's not the very smartest thing to mix occasional issues breathing, recent weight loss, use of codeine containing meds, and probable mild dehydration, with a depressant. I imagine one shot of bourbon would have me on the floor for real, but not in a fun way"
5521,Oh yeah this too
5522,"Same. Because I'm working from home, everyday sort of feels like a weekend. I've had a glass of wine almost every night with dinner."
5523,It's so easy to just drink all day WFH quarantining.
5524,Yes.
5525,Yep. Yep. Yep. I feel guilty but I‚Äôm climbing the walls and I just need something to take the edge off.
5526,Lol! I stocked up with enough treats for a month and managed to chomp through everything in less than a week.
5527,Cheesecake is the food of  gods. But can‚Äôt get any üò¢
5528,Ooooh. Storebought or homemade? My toddler niece has been getting into the song and I think it‚Äôd be nice to make her some.
5529,You can buy them online now!!!! It even asks for your zip code so your money goes to your local troop!!!!!
5530,If you have Aldi near you they sell incredible knock off versions in their snack section like a quarter of the price and you can get them year round.
5531,Same. My boyfriend and I had bowls couscous for lunch. Just couscous and butter.
5532,Welcome to my world. No standards at all.
5533,"So, salad?"
5534,The convenience store on my street has the oversized combo packs of cheddar jack and jalape√±o Cheez-Its. You bet your butt I bought every single one of them and convinced myself in the moment I was supporting a small business.

5546,"Woman, I know. I know."
5547,"Maybe have something worthwhile delivered?  Eli' s cheesecakes delivers in 3 days and they have free shipping right now!  You could get the chocolate sampler.  Thank you poster who clued me in to this farther up the thread, dammit, yes I still gotta put socks on"
5548,I was clever and bought so much chocolate and ice cream before the self isolation in Germany. I only go grocery shopping every 2 weeks now before I was going 2 times a week.
5549,MAN I HEARD THAT
5550,Same! My ED always flares up when I‚Äôm feeling super anxious
5551,Same
5552,"My appetite is way down too. I watch the news just to see numbers going up,  but I'm trying to restrict myself to shorter times viewing the news to the Governor's daily update. I'm a bit of a control freak,  to gain control I seek knowledge as to what is causing me stress...hence the news. I've got multiple health issues so COVID-19 is my worst nightmare."
5553,Yes! This is one of the few times I'm NOT comfort eating. My anxiety has my stomach in knots.

5558,I made a caramel banana bread that blew my mind. And ate half a loaf in one day. üò¨
5559,"Same! I keep buying bananas, not eating them in time, and then making banana bread and weird paleo blogger recipes involving bananas. 

On the plus side, I haven't had any leg cramps in weeks, so I'm calling it a win."
5560,I turned mine into french toast for breakfast this morning. Calling it banana french toast makes it healthy
5561,Same. Bbq chips have become my go to snack. I've never ate them before a couple week ago.
5562,I need this! Do you have a recipe??
5563,I make Annie‚Äôs sweet potato one
5564,Recipes?
5565,Shhh that's health food. Oatmeal and raisins are healthy...
5566,I‚Äôm all about organic Fuji apples at the moment. I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant so my cravings change randomly and rapidly though.
5567,I love this so much lol
5568,"Idk where you are geographically, but here in New England it's dreary and cold af. Some hot oatmeal would be PERFECT right about now."
5569,"I have been drinking SO MUCH kombucha. Like an abnormal amount, even for a kombucha fiend like myself. I‚Äôve gone through a small growler a day for the last week.

My gut flora is so healthy now ahaha"
5570,"Not to enable you, but Amazon sells five pound bags of Haribo gold bears. They were my go-to snack sorting a super rough project at work and I'm sad I left them at the office."

5575,This comment is amazing
5576,"Same. I think it's their association with holidays, and also the pure caloric ecstacy that is starch, butter, and salt."
5577,Like... With the rice mixed into the mashed potatoes?
5578,Yes. Came here to write this.
5579,It's the covid 19
5580,Here‚Äôs to you feeling better soon!

5583,Are you me? :)
5584,My spirit animal.
5585,Order an Eli‚Äôs Cheesecake! Best cheesecake ever and they will ship it frozen to your door in like 3 days!
5586,"If you have access to groceries, see my EASY cheesecake recipe above.

Hope it gets better."
5587,Make some? It's easy.
5588,Can you make one yourself?
5589,so many good recipes!! It's my favourite thing to bake. You can even make nice ones in a rice cooker.
5590,"Store bought, though I try to get them from bakeries rather than the supermarket.

I made totally non traditional green tea and red bean ones last year and they were really nice, I'm probably going to make them again this year as Mum wants them."
5591,Wait really?! Is this all year round???
5592,"You know, I really don‚Äôt appreciate this enabling. I‚Äôm having a hard enough time with all the Oreos that are in stock."
5593,"if u have it/can get it, cooking it in stock is really nice"
5594,thats what i say to my mum when she calls to see how i am
5595,Seriously. It‚Äôs been a bottle a day. Waiting to buy more until Thursday...we‚Äôll see how that goes.
5596,I have 8 bottles getting delivered tomorrow... it was a long week of waiting!
5597,Yeah I'm super happy about it :-)
5598,"Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!"
5599,What is going on
5600,Toast your flour in the oven for a bit and use applesauce or banana instead of egg and you‚Äôve got yourself some safe raw cookie dough
5601,"My son has an egg allergy. Chickpea/garbanzo water is a great substitute. Just open a can and pour it off. And raw cookie dough is now no longer off limits. 

Then you roast the beans with seasonings for 45 minutes and you have another yummy snack."
5602,You can sous vide eggs for safety and put the flour in the oven. Cookie dough all day long!
5603,"Me too, solidarity. I'll go eat something decent for a snack in a little while if you will too?"
5604,"Hahah. No, I just really love poutine!"
5605,"Its actually really easy to make it. I buy the frozen seasoned fries at Safeway. I bake that for 20 mins at 425 F after preheating the oven. As for the gravy, I like to melt a about 50 grams of butter, and then add freshly ground pepper to it. Then, I add about 100 ml of beef broth and 100 ml of chicken broth, one tbsp of all purpose flour. I let it simmer down, while stirring it, to gravy consistency. Voila! add some cheese to the fries after its done and drizzle the gravy over it."
5606,Oh! I must tell you that if you have a Sheetz gas station they sell fried cheese curds to go. You are welcome.
5607,Welcome to the dark and crispy side
5608,i havent tried that one yet! lately i've been obsessed with daiya's mac n cheese (all kinds lol)
5609,I had to go check what kombucha was! Sounds nice though
5610,"So like kale chips? I feel like it loses nutritional value if it‚Äôs all baked like that. But I definitely have tried it with minced garlic and chili for cheesy, spicy, garlicy kale chips ü§™"
5611,It made me uncomfortable in an itchy sort of way
5612,"That holiday thing is spot on. Some of my favorite holiday memories are gorging on potatoes, as well as the smell of onions sauteeing in butter. Now I'm hungry."
5613,"Nope, mashed potatoes and fried rice on the side."
5614,I should say ‚Äúat least one‚Äù haha
5615,Hello there :)
5616,"Laying in bed wondering if it's worth getting up to go use the big computer with all the ordering data on it.... It's 5AM... but it's cheesecake... but it's5 freaking AM....

Edit: WELL DAMMIT THEY HAVE FREE SHIPPING.  Now I gotta go put socks on!"
5617,"For the love of god....

Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
5618,Just commenting to find this later.
5619,Yeah but need to go out get the ingredients it‚Äôs hard at the moment üò≠
5620,"I‚Äôve never actually had any before. The recipes I‚Äôve found look really easy. Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to pick up some missing ingredients before Good Friday. 

The green tea and red bean sounds amazing. I‚Äôve been craving red beans lately. This must be a sign for me to make 2 versions! Haha"
5621,I am not sure how long they are doing it for but it‚Äôs cus of yanno...the rona cutting into cookie sales. I follow the girl who played Matilda on twitter and she tweeted it lol. l[cookies](https://www.girlscouts.org/en/cookie-care.html) there‚Äôs the link!!!
5622,I‚Äôm about to buy so many Samoa‚Äôs and those little peanut butter buddies *sorry for using the other b word my bad I meant no harm*
5623,"Just bought some Oreos too. COVID-15 gonna be real, real soon."
5624,üòÇüç∑
5625,Oh I hear ya!
5626,How do you eat it normally? I love strong flavors but I haven‚Äôt eaten a lot of goats cheese!
5627,"I use goat cheese for a really delicious arugula salad with pears and pine nuts. Some balsamic, olive oil and black pepper and mmmmm. Goat cheese is the shit. Also seeing recipes on Pinterest to fry them and dip them in honey. If you have 4 lbs of it you should try that!"
5628,Millions of families suffer every year!
5629,MICHAEL
5630,It's actually the raw flour in dough that makes it dangerous.
5631,That‚Äôs a good idea! I‚Äôll make some popcorn
5632,"It's too late, you're one of us now üá®üá¶"
5633,Get 100% out of town. Y'all have BOXED vegan mac & cheese over there? *cries in european*
5634,"It‚Äôs my newest drink addiction. Great for your gut health (hello being regular lol) and it has a really gentle fizz to it! I‚Äôm a big fan of humm brand, strawberry lemonade or hopped grapefruit (both are non alcoholic but if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after the brand boochcraft make a solid one!)"
5635,I would have put pants on but I'm sure the delivery person appreciates socks!
5636,Fuck. Is it **that** bad?? I‚Äôm in Sydney and we‚Äôre not there yet... üòï
5637,[Here's ](https://www.lifestylefood.com.au/recipes/26654/matcha-hot-cross-buns) the matcha red bean version! I used a tin of sweetened red beans instead of plain.
5638,Omg. Thank you so much for your comment. I have literally been staring sadly at an empty box of peanut butter patties for the past two weeks. You have made my week!!!
5639,"I am a simple woman and will literally just eat it with a spoon, especially with this crazy amount of it! Otherwise I'll make sandwiches and I love combining the goat cheese with avocado"
5640,Goat cheese + olive tapenade on toast = yum time!
5641,"Jesus christ that sounds delicious, I should absolutely try it! Thanks for the recommendation"
5642,Micheal!
5643,"Ok i googled and you are right it is both. I didn‚Äôt think of flour having the risk of ecoli but it does. 

But raw egg also carries the risk of salmonella."
5644,Definitely depends on where you are in Europe and where you are in the US! A lot of European cities have way more vegan products than places in the US. Not that that makes you feel better...
5645,"Annie‚Äôs is the only one I‚Äôve seen personally. I barely discovered them, they‚Äôre harder to find but  a game changer regardless"
5646,ha ha ha!  It's cold where we are so I have to put socks on to protect my bed-warm toes from the evil of the Cold Front Room From Whence Orders May Be Placed.
5647,I‚Äôm so glad I could help enjoy your cookies ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèª
5648,I aspire to have a giant tub of cheese and a spoon right now. Godspeed.
5649,"I am a part-time personal trainer :) 

Yes, I like my job. 

I got into it because health + fitness (overall well-being/physical fitness) is the only constant thing in my life, and has saved me from spiraling. I‚Äôm also pretty good at teaching and guiding others, so it merges. :)

Favorite part is ... seeing the development of my client over time, whether that be with physique... technique ... form.. hitting A PB. 

Least favorite part is ... when you are just starting out, how long it can take to develop a loyal, wide client base. 

I have Learnt about mixing professionalism with who I am as a person. Having your own business is fantastic for learning to develop professional relationships that also have an element of ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù to them. 

Anything I would change? So far, no. Would like to eventually move to online training."
5650,"1) yes

2) i literally picked the most random, cool thing i could think of at the time, and never looked back

3) favorite: the variety
Least favorite: the bureaucracy 

4) i learned the tasks necessary for the position. 

5) yes, but i can't, so you know that slogan ""change the things you can, chill on the things you can't""? That's my motto now. 

In general, I'd say pick something you're mildly interested in and don't make it your whole life. Hobbies and personal time matter way more than a hypothetical ""dream job"". Even if it was your dream before, you will eventually see it as just a job, so don't ruin a perfectly good passion by commercializing it."
5651,"I am an event photographer.

I've just kind of always been into photography as far back as I can remember. 

My favorite part is the taking pictures. My least favorite part is photo editing and dealing with whiny customers. 

What would I change? I'd like to do more wildlife/nature photography, but it's just easier to do events professionally."
5652,I love my job. I'm a pastry cook. I got lucky and a friend from culinary school helped me get my first job in a kitchen. I pretty much love everything about working in a kitchen. I'm able to do what I love and be part of a team. Working on your feet for 8+ hours is tough but it's so rewarding. I've learned so much working in a kitchen. Not just techniques to better my career but how to work with different types of people. There is only one thing I would change about my job. I'm usually the only pastry person in a kitchen but I would love to be apart of a pastry team.
5653,"1) yes, very much

2) one decision, a lot of luck, a little vision ^(and a ton of passion for the service I support)

3) My favourite part is supporting and improving accessibility for public services used by thousands of people per day. My least favourite part is.. gosh, I dunno.  I guess working the occasional night shift is hard, but that's been true at every job I've had

4) that working on something that is a net positive for society makes a huge difference in how you feel about work at the end of the day. I could make (and have, in the past, made) more money by just helping line some guy's pocket while providing no value to society, but like... why

5) nothing that matters"
5654,"For the most part, yes. I am a social worker and it was not originally the oath I had intended to go down, but no regrets applying for the job. 
My favourite aspect of the job is working collaboratively with stakeholders to get the best possible outcome for a client. 
The least favourite aspect ist caseload being too damn high. 
I have learnt how to effectively communicate what my boundaries are, and this is applied to both my professional and personal life. 
I don‚Äôt think I would change anything with my current job, other than reducing my caseload."
5655,">Do you like your job? 

Yes.

>How‚Äôd you get into it? 

I was in law school on a different tract.  Then something major changed, and I took a principled stand against that previous tract....finished law school kind of, in the wind a little bit.

So I took a job at a non-profit as a specialist that requested a law degree, but didn't require sitting for the bar.  Two years later, I am the director of policy at that non-profit.

>What‚Äôs your favorite/least favorite part? 

There are a lot of times where I hear people talk about how meaningless they feel at their jobs...I never feel that way.  I feel like I'm helping people a lot.

The stress is really the worst part.  An example is a couple of weeks ago when I was helping write a brief, and I had to essentially work on that, because it needed to be done by the end of the day, while finding money in my budget to pay for the interns and specialists that were about to be sent home for ??? because of the coronavirus.

>What have you learned from it? Is there anything you would change?

How much I like working on puzzles is the biggest thing.  

It's a non-profit, so the biggest change would be more money for the organization, more money for me, less time working at home, less stress...."
5656,"I'm the senior global director of content strategy for a major skincare company. Overall I do like it. I got into it by majoring in English, starting out as a copywriter and then working my way up to more senior and strategic roles. 

Fave things: 
- I travel first class all over the world (well, I did, lol). I have racked up a ton of points so basically I fly and stay for free everywhere when I take personal vacations. 

- I get so much free makeup and skincare. If not our own brand or our sub brands, then any other brand I want for ""product research."" I haven't purchased makeup or skincare for myself in over 2 years. 

- The pay is excellent and has allowed me to help my parents financially after my dad was diagnosed with cancer and forced into an early retirement 

Cons: 
- It's incredibly stressful. There is a lot of pressure and real numbers I have to hit.  If I don't, I'm out 

- I do a lot of presentations and I still find them stressful. I get nervous speaking in front of people. 

- The travel is a double-edged sword. I like it but I hate being away from my two dogs. I have anxiety and I obsessively check my home surveillance cameras to see them and I text my dog nanny prob a little too often when I'm gone."
5657,[removed]
5658,"1. No I don't I'm glad I have it though
2. Through mutual connections
3. The money and accommodations
4. It isn't rewarding or fulfilling to me
5. I learned to network, socialize, speak up, grew a spine, have confidence, problem solving, time management, deal with conflicts and public speaking skills. So many things and I'm so grateful that I have been able to grow professionally and personally.
6. Yes lots of things I would change about how we process things"
5659,"1. No not really, I don't mind it, but It's not what I want to be doing 6months time. 
2. I applied for it, knowing it would allow me to save $$ 
3. favourite part, the people! I work with an awesome crew, least favourite, I'm away from home 2 weeks at a time 
4. I've learned a lot about what I want to actually do as a career. 
5. I would change my job completely, but I am working on that and have a lot of plans in place, but in saying all that I am thankful to have this job, it has given me many opportunities"
5660,"Love my job.

Got my current position through networking.

Least favorite part: vacation/sick leave is kind of a joke, but I'm happy to take unpaid time when I need it.

Favorite part: working from home is niiiiiice.

What I've learned: I moved from the academic side to the vendor side of libraries, and it's been eye-opening. 

What would I change: I'd like more paid time off, but I'll survive."
5661,"I don't love it, but I don't dislike it either. It's just fine, which is good enough for me.

I got into it because decided that I needed a stable job and income (after I gave up trying to make it as a freelancer) so I started applying to any open position that my skills could be useful for. This was the best fit.

My favourite part is the good work/life balance it allows, and how low-stress it is. My least favourite part is that sometimes it can get quite boring, but I can live with that.

I think I've learned a lot about working with a team of other people. I had always worked alone before, so it has been interesting.

If I could pick one thing to change, it would be the salary, for sure! It is currently quite low. I hope it will increase a bit as years go by, but I know I will never earn a lot of money with this company."
5662,"Do you like your job?
Surprisingly, yes. I work in public administration, which doesn't sound super exciting and definitely was not on the list when I was 15, but it has turned out to be much more interesting than I expected it to be. Or maybe that's just what I'm telling myself. I work mainly with schools and am in contact with teachers, students, parents and other people who work in education all the time and there are a lot more interesting people involved in the education system than what I thought.

How'd you get into it?
I did a master's degree in a field where I knew it would be difficult to get a relevant job right away, I applied also for a couple of jobs that I thought I could do for a while to gain some experience, and that's the one I ended up with.

What's your favourite/least favourite part?
All the different people I meet are my favourite part. Every child goes to school, so there are families from all parts of society, there's great teachers who do a lot of good work. Also, this being the first time I have more that a part-time student job, it's just generally a lot to learn, which I enjoy. And currently I'm in the very privileged position to be able to work from home and quite sure that my job will still be there in  couple of month, despite the whole virus situation. It's still public administration though, so there is a lot of really boring paper work and way more Excel than I would like.

What have you learned from it?
How public administration works when you're on the other side of the phone, and that sometimes I'm just as frustrated about not being able to do more as the person on the other end. But also that there is a lot you actually can achieve if you just care.

Is there anything you would change?
I'm still planning on eventually finding something where I can use more of my education and maybe do a little less paperwork,  but for now I'm happy with the situation."
5663,"I‚Äôm a casual retail assistant at the golf club that I‚Äôve been playing golf at since I was 9 years old (20 now) ... I‚Äôm starting to get sick of it. 

Favourite part - busy days dealing with loads of customers, time goes quickly, as well as being in my local golf environment, everyone knows me there hence it‚Äôs comfortable for me to work within my common grounds. 

Least favourite - my boss (new boss‚Äô daughter is my teammate who has been taking most of my shifts), my supervisor (most meticulous, overly compulsive person who told one of my friends once that they‚Äôll get taken off the roster if he catches them without their name badge again, the company itself is one of the most unprofessional and corrupt places run by Man, and most of the time I have fuck all to do. Busy days are Saturdays and Sundays and I get planted with weekdays - hence I‚Äôm constantly bored and feel pretty unimportant and bad for not having anything to do."
5664,"I do enjoy my job. It can be very fulfilling. I'm a TMS Technician. TMS = Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. If you'd like to learn more about TMS specifically, I'd suggest watching this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXEn-pbBcNg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXEn-pbBcNg) 

But basically, I'm the person who puts the device on patients' heads, schedules their daily appointments, works with the psychiatrist to make sure everything is going okay, etc.

I got into it because I had a bachelors in psychology, and my company is one of the only companies (at least where I live) that would hire someone with a bachelors. A lot of mental health companies require at least a masters.

My favorite part is getting to see my patients' get better over time. When they can come in and say ""It's working, I'm feeling so much better!"" that's when I know that I'm making a difference.

My least favorite is that when we're really busy, it can get hectic, especially if I'm the only tech in the office. I once had 18 patients in a day by myself. It was hard to find time to eat lunch or even go to the bathroom.

I have learned so much about how the brain works, how Major Depressive Disorder affects everyone differently, and that empathy is what most people to desire. They just want to be understood.

I guess one thing I would change is more time off. We can never close for more than 2 days at a time, so we only get Christmas Eve and Christmas Day off. But then again, I know that the holidays can be a stressful time for a lot of people so I'm glad we're open to help patients."
5665,"I'm a doctor.

1. Yes I like it to some extent
2. I got into it by graduating medical school and applying for training 
3. My favourite part is the job satisfaction from helping patients, and the fact that it is a stable well respected profession. Least favourite is the long hours, weekends and oncalls.
4. I learned a lot about medicine itself. As for soft skills, I became a lot more resilient, thick skinned and assertive, as the hospital environment has no mercy.
5. I would change the working conditions to be more fair. Doctors work ridiculous hours and we often miss things like weddings, graduations etc. It's also very common to get put on call even for your wedding day and then having to arrange swaps etc. even if you notify months in advance. It can be a real pain missing out on everything due to work."
5666,"I'm a marketer for a publisher.

The good is that it's very stable and chill. Everyone comes on time and leaves on time. No hecticness. The benefits are great and people are nice.

The bad is that progress in incredibly slow. It's the perfect company for people looking for a place to retire.

I hope they embrace change more."
5667,"Lawyer here and my job is fine. I don't hate it and I think that's a good thing compared to a lot of people. I get to help the public on a local scale which was a goal of mine when I went to law school. 

With my job I have the income/time to travel, I bought a house, and not bad health insurance. 

I just wish this job was in a different country. I've lived abroad in two countries and I'm always my happiest when living abroad. I make great friends, my health is generally better, and even when things suck, I'm still having a good time. 

If I could suggest anything to you, go live abroad before you have an SO or kids. You learn so much about yourself.  I'm the type of person who can pack a bag and just leave and I love that about myself. Needless to say the current world situation has been tough for me. Lol."

5670,I work for the department of defense.
5671,"Nothing anymore.  I dated a coworker when I worked at a bookstore in college and when things went south, it was terrible.  Not worth it."
5672,Nothing. Dont shit where you eat.
5673,"Nothing. I can‚Äôt think of anything worse than dating someone I work with. Just a universal rule in any job I‚Äôve had. I wouldn‚Äôt trust a coworker to be discreet, and I can‚Äôt imagine how things would go if they turned bitter. It all comes down to ‚Äúdon‚Äôt shit where you eat‚Äù."
5674,"Nothing, really. There's a reason that ""don't shit where you eat"" is such a great slogan.

Now, I work in an industry where coworker dating is against workplace policy, and for very good reason- it's a bad idea all around, but its worse when you're in a serious profession and people are giving you sensitive information. Even if someone is the absolute best ever partner for me and I miraculously know that, I would never sacrifice my career for them. Wouldn't happen."
5675,"Hoo boy. For a significant part of 2020, I was really into this guy who was doing his thesis with the same professor as me. We would collaborate on research and meet at least thrice a week. 

I didn't ask him out because I didn't know if he was involved with someone else and cause I didn't want to make it awkward. 

If I knew that he was interested in me as well, I would have dated him. But, I wouldn't date someone who holds some amount of authority over me or someone I hold authority over."
5676,"Done it once, never will again."
5677,"My fianc√© and I actually started as coworkers. We worked together for 10 months before I made the first move. Then we continued to date and work together for two years before I decided to change fields.

My biggest reason for even going forward with it in the first place was his discretion. Getting any info about his personal life out of him was like pulling teeth. It made it difficult to get to know him, but it also made me trust that no matter what happened our personal business wouldn‚Äôt be brought into the workplace. Had he been an office gossip I‚Äôm not sure I would have given it a go."
5678,"I haven't before, but I have thought about it. If it's a job that I don't plan on having for long, then I wouldn't mind dating a coworker. If its something I am invested in longterm then they would have to meet a couple criterion for me to think it's worth it. First off, neither of us could have authority over the other in the workplace. Secondly, I would have to know them pretty well, like I would want to have hung out with them casually as friends before. I'd have to be confident enough in their character to know what a potential fallout would look like."
5679,"I've had a couple of FWB things with coworkers. It's at a bar/restaurant so super low stakes, short term and we don't work that closely. Never really had issues. They were just really hot and i was rebounding. Fun work banter plus 10 cocktails = a fun month."
5680,"I've done it and it's never worked out in the past. Plus I've had coworkers want to and then make things at the office really difficult because I wasn't interested in them like that. People can make it work, but the second it goes wrong, it gets nasty."
5681,I find that pretty inappropriate and I wouldn't do it.
5682,"Yup. I have and if I were to ever be single again (unlikely), I wouldn't hesitate if there was someone I was interested in. Many people I know have met their spouses at work and the only time I've seen things go south is when someone was having an affair with a coworker."
5683,Nothing. That's a terrible idea. I consider it inappropriate and unprofessional in most cases.
5684,If we were involved before we started working together (the situation my husband and I are in currently).
5685,If one of us has put in their two weeks notice.
5686,"i am. at the moment our roles are very different and we're pretty far removed from each other work-wise, on paper at least, but i didn't hesitate and probably wouldn't have hesitated even if we worked closely together. eventually we might, and i didn't like the idea at first, but i've had a lot of time to observe the way he does things and i believe we're fairly well aligned, so now i find it exciting rather than unnerving. 

i've also grown to trust him not to fuck me over and force me to completely cut him out of my life for the sake of my sanity, which sometimes happens to relationships, but of course i had no way of knowing that at the beginning, so it was a leap of faith. but i took that leap with the knowledge that even if everything somehow went entirely to shit, i could afford to quit my job at a moment's notice. not sure what i would have done if i were in a position where keeping my job was paramount. probably would've gone ahead with it anyway because i'm not great at self-denial, but it would've made me cautious."
5687,"Being in completely separate departments with no chance of ever being under the same management or needing to work on projects together. Anything else tends to go poorly in one way or another, whether the relationship works out or not. 

And truthfully, I‚Äôm only saying this based on the experience of working for very large employers in very small job markets‚Äîwhere people‚Äôs options in certain fields tended to begin and end with that employer, and horizontal job mobility was limited. In those circumstances, people tend to date coworkers a fair amount, and people‚Äôs spouses tend to wind up working for the same employer frequently. If you‚Äôre in a reasonably diverse job market where half the people in your dating pool aren‚Äôt your coworkers, dating elsewhere is _always_ the better option. It eliminates a lot of discomfort, rumors, and possible obstacles in the workplace; but one thing people always tend to forget is that it also helps you separate work from your private life and not have to worry nearly as much about confidentiality and work issues impacting your home life. A spouse who works in a totally different industry can give you impartial advice and will never blab to their teammate accidentally about what you told them in confidence. And bleak as it is, they‚Äôre a lot less likely to lose their job at the same time as you than someone who works for your own employer."
5688,"I would be willing to. I work as a doctor and most doctors marry other doctors. it's actually rarer not to date or marry a co worker in my field. Almost all my colleagues who dating or married and even my parents and their medical friends married other colleagues, whether it was another doctor or a nurse."
5689,"There‚Äôs nearly 1,000 employees in my building, so I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem dating a coworker as long as he‚Äôs in a different department. My small team is primarily female anyway."

5700,thank you - affair - meaning a) one of them is married or b) only meant to be a short thing?  yes I've seen several folks meeting their spouses at work and they are happily married and are from a similar background and they all moved on from the work place and went professionally their own way but were married since.
5701,ok got it
5702,"there are companies with different locations, you still would quit?  there are married people working in the same group at work - they don't quit"
5703,"thank you so much for answering. I think when you find love and trust you just know it and have to go for it. I think it's also important to feel sufficient by yourself and empowered to find a job somewhere else if needed - essentially yes we trust but if things  deteriorate we can leave. I think it's also important as someone else said, is it just an affair or is it the start of a longterm relationship/marriage.

Do you talk about (common aspects of) work in your private time? I think it should be kept to a minimum - what do you think?  do people at work know?"
5704,"yes it's safer to have a spouse somewhere else and it's better work/home separation. but if you get older and meet someone at work, why stop it only because you work together (at the moment) but as you say there might be no options to work somewhere else. I wouldnt mind working in the same company as the woman I love and who I met at work"
5705,"I am a dr and I met my wife at work who is a dr and we are married for 16 years. you work so much as a dr, we both had zero time. we both worked until 2am in the morning - doing additionally research."

5716,Affair meaning cheating. That's happened multiple times in my office so far. Never ends well lol.
5717,"No, I mean I'd only get involved with a coworker if one of us was about to leave. I don't want to start a relationship with someone at work. If I was with someone for a couple of years and then they got a job at my firm I wouldn't have a problem with that."
5718,">Do you talk about (common aspects of) work in your private time? I think it should be kept to a minimum - what do you think?

oh sure, a lot. and not just about the common aspects, all of it. but that's because we're both work people and we enjoy talking about it. i don't think any topic of conversation should be off limits, and it's important to me to be with someone who's passionate about what they do, which naturally lends itself to conversation centered around that topic, you know? i want to know all about it and be involved, and there's still room to talk about all sorts of other things.

but it's important for both people to have the same attitude. if one party is excited to discuss work and the other party subscribes to the notion that work is something that happens to you against your will and you have to get through the 9-to-5 before your real life begins, it's probably not gonna work out very well.

>do people at work know?

nah, none of their business. he's mostly remote so it's not hard to keep things private, and i'm generally averse to sharing the details of my personal life with people, coworkers or not. but i can see how it could be a bit challenging for people who are at the same office every day."

5721,ok thx - starting a longterm relationship can/will work but cheating definitely will not.
5722,"hmm - ok. I still think the entire can't start dating a coworker is overrated. what if there is one small town and only one employer and literally 60% of the town works there. now youhave to change town and start a long term relationship to date the woman/man you love?   I think we are more concerned about the company than our own needs. but I hear you, your way is safer but do you know how hard it can be to find someone who is compatible when you are getting older and now you found her/him and s/he is arm reach and you can;t have her because you work in the same 10k employee company in different buildings?"
5723,"\> but it's important for both people to have the same attitude. 

I am getting the feeling that I could learn a lot from you. I think you are right. that is the important part which i am struggeling with. I am interested at work in someone and she does not want any conversation about work after 5pm and I am just very different 

\> nah, none of their business.  

very professional. it takes me so long to figure out what to do but you somehow know it - very mature/no drama/solid. you are right - i am passionate about work as well and why would I not talk about it but somehow I am not mature in my approach/ i am still conflicted.

thank you"

5728,exactly that's what i am starting to realize - it's actually more a compatibility issue/question. in my case the coworker yes/no situation is just a surface problem distracting from the actual issue  - i think i am little clearer now - thx
5729,"First time I met my father-in-law, he observed that I was a ""bit more prosperous than he'd think was good for his son"", I went to the bedroom and cried. Luckily, said son thought differently and married me anyway."
5730,"It depends on what platform and who it is. Growing up I had body image issues that I think my parents accidentally instilled upon me. My mother was always overweight and unholy with herself so I never had a healthy role model for body image. They also taught me traditional body norms like body hair is gross and women should always shave. Things like that. Once I got to college and established my own confidence I tried growing out armpit hair and things just to feel empowered. My family poked fun at me for it when I visited and I always would respond with something like, ‚Äúit‚Äôs my body I have a right to do whatever I want and body hair is natural‚Äù

Online hate: 
usually just report and block
 
In the dating world:
When I have run into this, mostly on dating apps, I usually give a brief statement like ‚ÄúYou should learn that everyone is beautiful and can make their own choices. You don‚Äôt get to have a say‚Äù and then break off communication

In person: 
I usually get all little more upset and they‚Äôll them to f*ck off or just walk away altogether

Body shaming is NEVER okay. Body image issues are one of the most common mental health struggles people deal with and it‚Äôs never okay to perpetuate the issue."
5731,"I‚Äôve been body shamed since i was a kid. Each part of my body.....they would comment on my feet and make feel disgusted with it which i am still (eventhough its just a little wide) . Made fun of my arms, my butt, tummy, my face...Everything. 

How I responded was, i smile (forced), nod and keep quite. Cause that is what i was thought to do eventhough i was dying inside. 

Even when i lost weight, it wasn‚Äôt good enough. I would still get critique. Example, i was sitting with family and one of them said why i lost weight, your parents are not feeding you? Right after that someone said that, i just wanted to be like the people on the tv.

I still here this in my 20s. I gained weight in university and i‚Äôve started losing a bit after graduating and people have been saying things like oh you lost weight thats really good, you are still losing weight right, she needs to lose more etc

I dont understand why is there a need for others to comment about ppl‚Äôs appearance. Im really trying my best not to react to their comment such as smiling/giggling (thats my automatic response) but its difficult when they are very older than me and are family"
5732,I laugh and say thanks for your constructive criticism and then just give them the silent treatment as a way to say fuck you
5733,"""List all of the ways in which you are perfect..GO!"""
5734,"I used to repeat those comments in my head and further fueled my insecurities. I am pretty sure I suffered from body dysmorphia because of it. I have come a long way since then, and learnt to accept myself. I look worse than ever, but I am okay with it. I wasted too much of my life on this, I can't be bothered."
5735,"i used to take it really personally but i‚Äôve come to realize someone body shaming me is either jealous or just has a lot of deep rooted problems they‚Äôre projecting onto me. i have been body shamed in a while where it was actually valid, just to throw insults. don‚Äôt get me wrong, past experiences caused some serious body dysmorphia but i can at least see past the comments now"
5736,"I get pissed. My mom body shames me *all the time* even though I have a 1000x more desirable body than she ever had, and I'm actually hot! I have no idea what she sees."
5737,I used to take what other people say to heart. Right before graduating high school I had a breakthrough. I realized that it literally does not matter at all what others think of me. I can choose to let it affect me or I can choose to not let it affect me. I choose the latter.

5741,Insult them lol
5742,"Not much, because I think there is this low-key idea that it doesn't count when the 'shaming' is because I'm thin and fit. And the insults aren't overt, but more dismissive - I am lucky to be thin, must be nice to eat whatever I want, implications that I'm vain, etc.

So I just try to let it go. Easier than explaining that I don't overeat all the time, just this time they saw me, and that I move my body more before 6AM than most do all day. It's not worth the hassle for a speech about how they wish they had time to exercise and sleep well and not overeat... so, I try to just ride out that topic"
5743,"I used to be really short and skinny (I‚Äôm still short though lol) and people would often say stuff like, you ever heard of eating skinny, or the famous insult hey skeleton. I just ignored them, not paying any attention because I knew that‚Äôs what they wanted, a reaction, and I had no intention to give it to them."
5744,"I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with this, fortunately. But the one that always comes to mind when someone talks about being told to lose weight or something along those lines is comments my granny used to make until I told her I‚Äôve really had enough.

Around the time of hitting puberty, I got slightly chubby. I was never overweight, just a bit chubby. No big deal. I think that‚Äôs pretty normal. So sometimes she would tell me that I should cut snacking on sweets, because I had ‚Äúa huge butt and thick thighs‚Äù, which apparently is bad. She sometimes even lightly slapped a cheek or side-eye my butt. 
At first, I didn‚Äôt know how to handle that so I shrugged it off or would laugh. In retrospect that was pretty toxic omg. After some time, I would tell her that I didn‚Äôt agree or that I would cut it if I thought I was getting too heavy. I never even snacked that much. Her comments just seemed very unnecessary, especially because she herself has quite a belly.

The comments got less the older I got. I had shed some kilos because I‚Äôd grown up by then and I was getting more confident with myself to tell her, that I could take care of myself if I see the need to change my weight.
Last summer was the last time she said something and it probably will be the last time. I was with my bf for a year by then and let‚Äôs just say he completely disagrees with my granny regarding ‚Äúbig butt and thighs are bad‚Äù. That did boost my confidence that I am just fine like I am now.
Again, she told me to watch my diet and I went away raging. I cooled down and thought about what I was going to tell her. I really wanted to punch her real hard (I didn‚Äôt smack her, but I did slam the door. Not proud of it tho). I told her, that I was fed up with this sh*t, that I really wanted to punch her, because she just doesn‚Äôt get it and that I never want to her anything like that again, because I can take care of myself and her comments make me uncomfortable in my own skin, and I‚Äôd worked hard for some confidence in myself.

I was so angry, because she was the only person that would give little me the opportunity to be myself (my parents are difficult). I love her so much. She always supported my talents. She has been paying my piano lessons for more than 10 years now and enjoys when she hears me play (I‚Äôm 17 and still go to school). I‚Äôve been living with her for years now. She has treated me like her daughter. 
So it just hurt so much that she would be like that and make me feel like I wasn‚Äôt good enough after all. And that‚Äôs why I lashed out at her that day. She has never made any comment about my body ever since."
5745,"""Yes, I'm happy and healthy, thank you""."
5746,"If it's a stranger online, I ignore, block or delete the comments.

If it's someone irl that doesn't matter much to me, if not an authority, I'll point it out that it's body shaming and move on.

If it's someone dear to me, I make sure they know it's hurtful."
5747,"I just say flatly ""hahaha thanks """
5748,Depends. Is it my mom? I curse her to hell cause she‚Äôs been doing it my entire life. Someone random like a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù or stranger? I cry. A lot.
5749,i hate them
5750,"Eh. I think about it for a while, and then decide that I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôve never been particularly self conscious of my body."
5751,"I get teased about being ‚Äútoo skinny‚Äù & having to ‚Äúeat more‚Äù, one of my friends would even call ‚Äúanorexic‚Äù as a joke which was when I started getting disgusted by her making a joke like that. I would also get called ‚Äúflat‚Äù but eventually I became comfortable with my body & became more confident. I usually just ignore the comments or just reply with a dry ‚Äúokay‚Äù or ‚Äúyeah, I know‚Äù."
5752,"I am simultaneously criticised & praised for being underweight every day

Irl I just smile about it, on socials I ignore it"
5753,"It's usually my husband, and I usually cry."
5754,"The times it happened, either the guy was rejected by me and lashed out, or the person was the type to criticize everyone. I told myself they were/had the prob."
5755,I Unfriended someone recently who made me feel like my problems were minuscule. I‚Äôve been feeling pretty heavy lately and when I talk about it she made me feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be complaining because she‚Äôs a little bigger than me.
5756,*rolled my eyes* to the father in law. High five to the son!!
5757,Doesn‚Äôt prosperous mean wealthy?
5758,Preach!! What a fantastic way to put it! üëèüòå
5759,"Yeah fuck that. People who live in glass houses shouldn‚Äôt throw stones. They‚Äôre likely way insecure abt their own shit, and want to make u feel bad for whatever peace u can get.

I understand with family it‚Äôs hard to confront relatives directly, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they get off scot-free. I turn it around on them, or ask them why they would say smth so negative to someone they claim to love."
5760,"Maybe before jumping straight into confronting people about that, you can start out by performing smaller ‚Äúrisks‚Äù that take you out of your comfort zone first. The best way to do it, in my experience, is to let go of inhibition, say screw it, and remember that nothing bad will come of it. For example: you can start by complimenting strangers, engaging in more small talk, initiating conversations with strangers. That way, as you grow more comfortable with just *doing it* and thinking less about it ‚Äî it‚Äôll be hard to let go of that way of thinking, just a heads up ‚Äî you can work your way up to putting your foot down and telling people, ‚Äúno, you can‚Äôt say that about me and my appearance.‚Äù"
5761,Lol i like this!
5762,"This. I feel the same. Their comments really have effected my confidence and how i feel about my self. 

I am glad that you came out from it! And i am sure you look great! 

I wish ppl understood how their words can hurt others"
5763,Me too

5765,"I had that with a co-worker once.  She was talking about how she hates going on planes because she feels uncomfortable, like she is taking too much space.  I said how I felt the same way, and she gave me this ""look"", and told me ""You're fine"".

So just because she weighs a little bit more than I do, my feelings are invalid?"
5766,Everyone‚Äôs problem is valid. Im sorry she made you feel like that...
5767,"It... can? It's also a euphemism for being fat, though."
5768,"I try to think it that way too - that they are insecure. But they seem so confident.... 

Ohhh i wish i can turn it around and ask them. I used too (well i still do) practice my reaction if i am faced with this kind of stuff again but unfortunately my habit of nodding n smiling takes over. One day perhaps...."
5769,"Thanks for the kind words! It gets better. If anything their comments taught me to be mindful of my words and I learnt empathy. 
Just self-love, their words will have no effect üíô"
5770,üëç
5771,Why do people feel the need to belittle you. Like they feed off negativity and making others feel shitty.
5772,I absolutely agree and It‚Äôs okay. I was honest with her and told her I didn‚Äôt want her to be in my life anymore and she didn‚Äôt see what she did was wrong but that‚Äôs her loss.
5773,"I‚Äôm shy as hell when it comes to confrontation, but if I rly stew in something enough to get majorly pissed off (just concentrate on all the ways smth hurt me) I find it a lot easier to call someone out for being shitty. 

Dunno if that helps, it‚Äôs probably toxic as hell in reality, but once I‚Äôve finished I sure feel better."
5774,Yes I totally feel that too- mindful about my words and empathy.
5775,"I think my other response is just being quite or just answering stuff with one word. But im not sure if that come across that i mad at them or they just think its normal (cause i am quite around family) 

But i am sure that feels good when you call out someone!"
5776,"Kissing, sexting, behaving romantically towards someone who isn‚Äôt me."
5777,Emotional cheating is as bad as a full on physical affair in most people's eyes.
5778,Anything they wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing in front of my face
5779,"Expressing love and commitment to someone even if you ""don't mean it, and was just leading her on."" I'm more apt to forgive if it was just physical. But telling some other chick that you can picture her being the mother of your child, etc? What are you, an idiot? You're messing with me and this random girl. Then you ghost her, she becomes suicidal, and her friends are contacting me to tell you to stop leading her on? 
Divorce time!"
5780,"Kissing, sexting, things that qualify as emotional cheating. Like expressing a type of love and commitment to someone that you would only do in a relationship."
5781,Anything that should be just for us. Saying I love you is obviously a big one!
5782,"I‚Äôd be more devastated by emotional cheating than sex. 

If my fianc√© was ignoring me frequently to hang out with another woman, or spending his entire day messaging her, that would be hurtful. If he was thinking about her more than me, like getting her amazing extravagant gifts or always coming to her aid if she had a problem, no matter how small. Things like that. It would probably destroy my sanity."
5783,Anything they wouldn't do if I were in the room.
5784,"Kissing, I suppose."
5785,"Any kind of intimate physical touch, sexting, sending nudes, becoming emotionally attached."
5786,Kissing sexting flirting etc of course. Also confiding in and being too open with her. (Like revealing details of our relationship or worse sex life or stuff that is very personal) anything that he wouldn't be comfortable doing right there in front of me and anything he wouldn't tell me about.
5787,Starting an onlyfans
5788,Emotionally bonding to another girl deeply
5789,Falling in love with someone else is cheating in my book. How do you carry on a relationship when someone admits that they've fallen for someone else?
5790,"Spending one on one time with another female is cheating in my partner and I's eyes (not in a work setting or alike).  Emotional cheating can include confiding in someone other than me regularly to the point where a bond is formed.  Aside from the obvious, forming a relationship with another woman where it's anything beyond platonic."
5791,"Kissing, sexting, physical touch like putting their arms around each other, holding hands etc. Also just being emotionally involved with someone else more than just friends"
5792,"flirting, kissing that kinda stuff"
5793," Kissing, touching, sexting, flirting"
5794,Porn
5795,Happy Cake Day
5796,Worse in many as well.
5797,"Eww. Also i feel like if leading her on is ever used to describe what you're doing, it falls under cheatin regardless of what you're doing"
5798,"It really does a number on you. I lived it last year after 4 years together. I (30M) thought that it was just a really stressful semester for her (31/F) so I did everything I could to be supportive and helpful and thought things would return to normal after finals. Instead everything got worse and I've never felt so lonely, worthless and unloved in my life. I trusted her and continuously gave her the benefit of the doubt and it definitely chipped away at my sanity. In the end she left me for him but dragged out the breakup process by 2 months (including >$1000 in counseling sessions while making no effort) so that she could continue using me for a place to live and to cover her bills. For months I kept trying to figure out what I did wrong, what I could have done differently, what was wrong with me. At work I'd have to step away 2-3x/day for a month or two to try and find someplace semi-private to have a breakdown and cry. In the end I'm just trying to stop asking myself those questions and move on."
5799,">Spending one on one time with another female is cheating in my partner and I's eyes (not in a work setting or alike)

Wait, doesn't this mean you can't have female friends? Or just that you have to be in a group setting? Like you can't just go for a dinner/drinks with only one of your female friends?"
5800,">my partner and I's

My partner's and my."
5801,Thank you!
5802,"And even if it wasn‚Äôt, who wants to date someone who thinks leading someone on is a great thing to do for shits and giggles? Being the kind of sociopath who enjoys being an ass to people to prop up their own ego isn‚Äôt particularly less dump-worthy than being a cheater."
5803,We‚Äôre both straight so opposite sex for both of us.  He doesn‚Äôt have female friends and I don‚Äôt have male friends.  It‚Äôs convenient for our beliefs.
5804,Thank you for the correction.  However both are acceptable nowadays.
5805,"if you don't mind me asking, what are your beliefs?"
5806,"We both believe that if you were to meet someone of the opposite sex and develop a friendship with them, then there is a large margin for developing that further.  

I do a close-contact sport that is 90% male, so I spend my time around a lot of males.  He hangs out with his friend who has a girlfriend.  We interact with either sex.  His job puts him in people‚Äôs houses alone with them.  Ya know. 

It‚Äôs not an unhealthy ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to females‚Äù.  We both just don‚Äôt think one on one time with the opposite sex is necessary.  We know a lot of people don‚Äôt see it this way, but we just naturally think this and do what makes us both happy. 

People assume it‚Äôs two people controlling the other when we both entered this relationship, we discussed our boundaries and limits and both realised we think the same.  It‚Äôs convenient, we have no fights about it, no arguments, we never have to bring it up.  We‚Äôre on the same page.  We‚Äôre both secure."
5807,"A lot of these recommendations are not recommended by dermatologists. I would talk to a dermatologist or at the very least go on a sub where people know more than the average person, like r/skincareaddiction"
5808,The body shop oats mask
5809,I thought you were talking about medical masks.  I was shocked you lived in an area if a choice!
5810,Any sort of green tea sheet mask like the Innisfree or The Face Shop ones are my go-to for a nice inexpensive hydrating mask that won't upset my skin.
5811,"Bentonite Clay. Especially if you think you may have some Fungal Acne. I use one that is Bentonite Clay & White Charcoal by Versed, and I just get mine at Target. It has a screw top, so you can use it multiple times and keep it fresh. My skin is really sensitive (27): I have oily/dry combo, get blackheads, what I think is mild fungal acne, and cystic acne. I use it every 3 days while im in the shower. I just leave it on while shaving and whatnot so that the steam keeps it from drying up, and follow up with a hydrating serum and probiotic moisturizer. Seems to do the trick!"
5812,"Masks aren't something that really help much in comparison to a good routine (double cleansing, chemical exfoliant, moisturizer, sunscreen). But when my sensitive and acne prone skin needs a rest or a little TLC I like to use just a honey mask. It is anti-bacterial and soothing."
5813,Raw honey actually!
5814,"The retinol I use for my acne made my skin sensitive and reactive, and since then my skin has only really liked the Neutrogena Hydro Boost masks. They‚Äôre not cheap, but you can get them at any drugstore."
5815,"The Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay mask on Amazon. It‚Äôs inexpensive, lasts forever, and works wonders at extracting impurities."
5816,"Try mixing honey, turmeric and you could add tea tree or lavender essential oil. Works great for me! My skin is so sensitive and reacts to most everything."
5817,Honey with activated charcoal and bentonite clay.
5818,Origins and Clinique both have great charcoal masks.
5819,"I'll second the bentonite Aztec Healing mask type mask and also say that a sulphur mask from Proactiv also helped me. But the biggest help for me has been to cut out dairy and cut down on sugar. It will take a couple months even for your skin to heal up after cutting out the dairy, but SO worth it. And every once in a while I always forget my own advice and eat a bunch of chocolate or smthg and the sugar breaks me out. Exercise and sweating things out/getting some good blood flow helps too! Best of luck!"
5820,"Peach Slices masks found at CVS in the U.S. Not sure about elsewhere. I use the brightening mask since it has niacinamide pretty high on the ingredient list. I accidentally fell asleep with it on, when I woke up and peeled it off my face my PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation aka. brown spots after healed acne) had faded almost completely."
5821,"Milk of magnesia - seriously, just slather it on your face and let dry."
5822,Don't use a mask. Most of them contain fragrance and aren't good for your skin. Maybe look into Salicylic acid and washing your face with it every morning.
5823,Aspirin face mask
5824,N95
5825,[removed]
5826,"Wish it worked for me. The times i've slathered even the best type of honey (Manuka), my face is left soft and supple but for some reason the lower right part of my face near my jaw is left red and itchy. As if my right portion of my jaw is allergic to it. Weird."
5827,This mask is hands down the absolute best! I read about it online and thought there is no way it can be that good but turns out it is even better.
5828,"Is this good for dry, sensitive skin?"
5829,"I add a couple drops of tea tree oil, it has anti-bacterial amd anti- inflammatory properties! Plus it helps with the smell if you're making the mask with apple cider vinegar"
5830,"Agreed! Doing it regularly really helps me. I have found that an easy way to make the mud is to put a tbsp of the powdered clay in a small glass jar, add a bit of water and then go do smthg else and wait for the clay to soak it up and form a nice smooth mud. Then I'll I keep it in the fridge and use it every couple days."
5831,This mask is insane. I only use it if I'm having a major breakout (usually after traveling a bunch where I'm not sticking to a routine) but it clears you up like THAT! My skin is sensitive but it reacts fine with this.
5832,Wow salicylic acid for acne. I'll have to try that some time.

5836,"No, it should really be avoided unless you have insensitive and oily skin, and very infrequently."
5837,Clay and tea tree oil are big no-no's for sensitive and dry skin.
5838,I would only use it max once a week and it did wonders!
5839,I meant using a product containing 2% Salicylic acid.

5841,Yeah crazy in the 14 years I've had acne I've never heard of it.
5842,[removed]
5843,"Girl,  r/skincareaddiction come on over, the water's fine!"
5844,I'm single anytime I don't have a partner. That doesn't mean that I'm available. Single and available are different things.
5845,As soon as the relationship is over.
5846,When I don't have a significant other.
5847,When the relationship ends.
5848,I‚Äôd give it 6 months to a year. I want to give myself time to heal and rediscover myself. I also see it as a sign of respect in a way.
5849,"As soon as we're not together, I'm single. I don't have to be romantically loyal to anyone I'm not actually dating."
5850,"immediately I guess, once you break up that's it really."
5851,"I always joke with my boyfriend that I have a 14-day back guarantee. So if we ever break up or consider it, if we haven‚Äôt reached out or tried fixing it within 14 days then we‚Äôre officially officially done. With my past relationships, I gotten over them in 6 months or less. But in my current relationship I feel like it‚Äôd take years if we ever broke up. He‚Äôs definitely the one I want forever so if something happens, I‚Äôd be devastated."
5852,"You are free to consider yourself completely single once all the components that were part of the relationship have been resolved . . . the awkward exchanging of personal items (here‚Äôs your deodorant, here‚Äôs your sweater), completion of moving out (if applicable), changing of the shared Netflix password, etc."
5853, After a relationship is over
5854,"Oh!! Very good thought.  Thanks, that is something to think about."
5855,"Yes, all very valid.  May I ask what you mean by a sign or respect? To yourself?"
5856,Thanks for responding. Only thing with that is we have a child so that awkward exchange will never be over.
5857,"No matter how good/bad the relationship was it just seems disrespectful to get into a new one right after. Makes it seem I didn‚Äôt care about him enough to give it some time. Sorry that‚Äôs the best I can explain it. 

(Of course it depends on how long ya‚Äôll have been together I guess)"
5858,That‚Äôs a great explanation. Thanks so much for responding.
5859,"I think it is still possible to truly care about others when you don't care about yourself. The part that is true about the sentence is that when you don't tend to your own needs enough, you might use others to fill that gap, and using others is not true loving. Loving is more about giving than about taking. So you become a better loved one for them when you give from the right place of mind. Also, you will have more space for others, and you'll be able to give to others more abundantly."
5860,"It's nonsense, but you do tend to do relationships better when you love yourself."
5861,"I associate this with self-care. If I'm not taking care of myself, I can't take care of others. I've tried. Every time it always results in me being let down, and/or depressed."
5862,I agree it‚Äôs nonsense. I hate myself and I make sure the people in my life never feel what I feel. They know I love them and I prove it every day.
5863,"I think it's crap. Just my opinion, but I don't love myself, or even like myself really, but there are so many people that I love and show that love to."
5864,"Lots of good replies here, but I want to mention a couple things that can lead to bad relationships:

Quite a few have mentioned being taken advantage of, but also you can overlook how toxic you could be for other people.

And in the vein of that, the stress it puts on your loved ones, knowing you don't love yourself, is also something that goes unacknowledged. If you love them, they should also be concerned for you."
5865,"There's some merit to it. Even though it's perfectly possible to love without loving yourself, and plenty of people love badly even if they have high self esteem, things do carry over to your relationships from your self image, whether it's codependency, envy, fears, judgement. 

I think that, more importantly, recognizing your self worth is important for making decisions on partner selection and relationships in general."
5866,"Misguided, like a lot quotes in that vein."
5867,It's bullshit. Love is more risky because you will overlook toxic bad traits and may not be as keen at catching warning signs but you absolutely can love others even when you aren't loving yourself. I've gone through periods where I just didn't love myself but I'll tell you I never stopped loving my husband.
5868,"It's more like ""You can't let your loved ones love you properly if you don't love yourself first, because you'll always be insecure and not believe their love is real or that you are worthy of it, you'll feel like a fraud"". At least that's my interpretation."
5869,I believe that you can love others and not yourself but there are some issues. 1. It‚Äôs easier to want a person for the purpose of affirmation and how they make you feel but not actually them. 2. It‚Äôs easier to get used because you are seeking affirmation and may lack self respect. 3. It‚Äôs easier to have a healthy relationship when you have a healthy relationship with yourself. 4. Having a partner can help you feel better about yourself but it also may be a very tolling thing for your partner to deal with.
5870,I personally think it's true.
5871,That you should be instantly wary of anyone spouting it.
5872,Total BS. You can still love others just fine. Just at higher risks for putting up with shittier behaviors from toxic partners
5873,Thats bullshit. You can learn to love yourself THROUGH loving someone cause they show you how lovely you are.
5874,Utter nonsense.
5875,"Simplistic! That said, I do believe long lasting love is better if you're confident and content with yourself!"
5876,"I‚Äôm a bit divided on this phrase. My two thoughts are:
* Of course I can love somebody without loving myself, I can show complete devotion, attentiveness, caring, thoughtfulness etc. for that person and really show and express what love means to me
* On the other hand, what comes with everything I just described is that if you don‚Äôt love yourself you sort of lose who you are. I‚Äôm not talking about sometimes having a bad day or just being okay with yourself but really hating yourself involves a sort of erasure of you as a person and you don‚Äôt do things like self care, standing up for yourself, hobbies you enjoy, taking care of your health.

*this is just my experience with it though*"
5877,"I think the phrase is a bit iffy, mostly because I am not sure what it means to ""love"" oneself and that can make it seem out of reach to some people.

But more broadly I absolutely think it's true that you're going to have a bad time with relationships if you don't have self *respect*, if you're looking for someone to complete and/or fix you yes. You need to sort yourself out on your own time."
5878,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true, because I know a lot of people who don‚Äôt particularly like themselves, but like being around people who love them to learn to love themselves."
5879,"well if misery loves company..and if people want you to do well, but not better than them  

idk, these are all results of a lack of self love"
5880,"you can love others, but your love wont provide them peace or healing"
5881,"I agree. Or rather, you can't have healthy love without first loving yourself. I know some unhappy and codependent people out there in ""loving"" relationships."
5882,I have loved others way more than I have ever loved myself. It makes no sense to me.
5883,"Used to think it was utter bs. Not so much anymore, since encountering a few cases of people that somehow ""extended"" their inferiority complex and lack of self esteem to those very close to them. From my perspective the logic is something like ""if i am shit anyone that is willing to put up with me must be a little shitty too, surely inferior than strangers"", if it makes any sense. I'm not saying it's a golden rule or anything, but for a certain type of peiple It is a real thing in a way."
5884,[removed]
5885,"I stumbled across this some time ago and will just leave it here‚Äî

‚Äú...Dr Tatkin gave the example of babies. Infants don‚Äôt shoot out of the womb meditating or possessing an ability to self-soothe; they merely cry a bit, drool a lot and receive love. These little ones love unconditionally because they‚Äôre dependant on the care of others to survive. And the simple act of existing means they‚Äôre automatically deserving of love and acceptance, no matter how they feel about themselves...Psychologists say finding someone who loves you might actually give you the self-love you hadn‚Äôt been able to cultivate until that point. Someone else loving the heck out of you can show you what you‚Äôre worth, make you feel worthy, and foster in you the feelings that were missing. Then before you know it, bingo, you‚Äôre returning that love.

And you didn‚Äôt have to love yourself first.‚Äù‚Äî Elizabeth Best, ‚ÄúLoving Yourself Before You Can Love Someone Else Is A Lie‚Äù; https://shesaid.com/loving-yourself-before-love-someone-else-lie/"
5886,"You can definitely love other people before loving yourself. Sometimes the problem is that the people whom you love don‚Äôt love you back, so you don‚Äôt love yourself either. I don‚Äôt know if it makes sense, but I found out that as soon as you ditch those who don‚Äôt live you, you start loving yourself a little bit more."
5887,"I‚Äôm glad you asked this question. 

Poppycock!! I don‚Äôt need to love myself more. That‚Äôs called narcissism. Lol"
5888,I dont think it's true. You can still love people very while heartedly but it can lead to some unhealthy relationships since theres people that take advantage of others with low self esteem all the time.
5889,I can see what the message is supposed to represent but With my whole being I love many people more than I love myself. I still like the saying and have said it before to others.
5890,"Personally, not loving myself and being unhappy with myself made me extremely self-centered. I was a bad partner and friend because I was always so focused on myself and my own pain and dissatisfaction and hatred.  So for me, it was true. I couldn't love others or be good for others when I didn't love myself. Obviously though, not everyone's the same. There are lots of people who can love other people and not love themselves."
5891,"I'm seeing these comments about it being nonsense and I can see what they mean. But I think it can depend on the person's situation and how they view it. Personally for me, I see it as what I currently feel. I'm afraid of being in a relationship due to me being afraid of just being a disappointment or an embarrassment to the guy I'd be with. I feel like I'd be useless in the relationship. I feel like my hobbies and passions will get in the way of the relationship. But when I feel this way, I push myself together and tell myself that if they can't handle my whole self, then they aren't the one! There's always someone out there for you! You just have to have patience and accept who you are before you find the wrong half of the person you're ""pretending"" to be."
5892,False completely. You can hate yourself and still fall In love. Sometimes it‚Äôs even better because if that person loves you then them loving you can open your eyes to the things they love about you and get you to appreciate and love those things too and help you begin to love yourself or love yourself more but you don‚Äôt need to love yourself to love someone else.
5893,"I think it isn't necessarily true, but having a lot of confidence certainly makes dating easier, I would imagine. Majority of the reason why I'm so unsuccessful with getting with people I'm interested in is because I'm so insecure about them rejecting me. If you love yourself to the point where you are not discouraged by other people not loving you, Im sure that ought to make it easier to take rejection"
5894,"I‚Äôve never really completely understood this concept. Yes, I do think a relationship is easier in some way if you love yourself, but is it really necessary? Personally I feel like your SO can help with your confidence and self love. Some people don‚Äôt have self love because some don‚Äôt have the people around them that help, so being in a relationship could boost that. 

Idk I‚Äôve never really been in a ‚Äòreal‚Äô relationship but thinking about not being able to love someone else just because you don‚Äôt love yourself is a bit odd."
5895,"It‚Äôs 100% facts.

I think some people confuse love with co-dependence.

Being attached to someone or doing nice things for them doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre in love. Some people do these gestures because it is them who requires the validation. 

External validation and appreciation can help another being LEARN to love, but before then I believe it‚Äôs fairly difficult.

I found it very difficult to love and appreciate others wholeheartedly until I felt the same for myself."
5896,"Every parent is ashamed of themselves as a parent, but we still love our children."
5897,It's bullshit
5898,"Touchy-feely emotional wanking to American self-help books - pfft. 

I consider myself a compassionate and emotionally intelligent adult woman. For me this style of self-talk is not dignified, not productive and not consistent with self-respect.

Obviously lots of people have put the concept to better use than I can, though."
5899,How is it misguided?
5900,Agree! That's good love
5901,Can you explain? I wanna hear your thoughts.

5903,"It's entirely possible to love someone without loving yourself, or having a great sense of self worth. Look at all of the posts on the relationship subs on Reddit. Prime example. 

Is that love healthy, or are the relationships from it necessarily healthy? No."
5904,"Not loving yourself doesn't mean you are incapable of loving others. It can sometimes mean that you are unable to have a healthy relationship with other people, yes...but it doesn't mean you are incapable of love."
5905,"I think that‚Äôs what it means thought. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs straight forward, I think it means you can‚Äôt halve a healthy, happy love if you don‚Äôt love yourself. Or even just like yourself."
5906,"I think a more realistic phrase would be, ""you can only love others as much as you love yourself"". Like you cant provide someone with a sense of love you've never felt yourself."
5907,"Restorative Art. Started as just for my job but I have a talent for it. 


Starting to get a reputation for how good my bodies look at work ü§òüèª"
5908,"Mastering a skill is pretty much impossible in art, there is always more to learn :)

I'm in the process of learning an orchestral instrument, I have always loved classical music and wanted to get back into it as an adult. It's humbling to have to learn something that comes so much more easily to children, but there's a big online community of people in similar situations."
5909,Drawing impressionism... look at my profile if you're curious... but I've been drawing all my life. But my God art frustration and depression make me question my craft
5910,I'm just here to say that this post has inspired me. Thanks. :)
5911,Not a master at all but I do glitter paintings. I got into it because I just had an idea for a painting and wondered if it would work with glitter. I tried it and it worked out. I haven't done one in a little bit but I think I'm pretty good at it.
5912,"I haven‚Äôt mastered anything, but I would say I have a good knowledge on many art forms. The most beneficial thing I‚Äôve found is taking a whole bunch of classes in a whole variety of media that fascinates you. I was essentially forced to do this through the art foundations classes required of my art education degree. I ended up loving everything I did besides printmaking, and it all led to exploring offshoots and a variety of other related media. Just don‚Äôt be surprised when you want to be a ceramist/painter/printmaker/carver/weaver/etc. It‚Äôs wonderful to build a plethora of skills. You can use one media to inspire ideas in another, and you can make mixed media masterpieces. Check out the ‚Äúmaker‚Äù trend in art communities. There are people out there that develop skills in so many areas they can make masterful projects from start to finish completely themselves. Strive to have tons of knowledge and become a master artist as opposed to a master in a media."
5913,Does juggling count? This self quarantine finally gave me the time to try üòÖ
5914,What kind of items do you restore? Do you have any examples you can share? Sounds really cool.
5915,"Very true! Always something down the road.

And good for you, I can relate in the fact that I feel certain things are more difficult to pick up than compared to when I was a child or teen. It's very rewarding to pick up new or old things as an adult & keep that creative spark alive."
5916,"I just looked at some of your work..your art is beautiful! The bright color palettes make me feel nostalgic. I especially love the image of the woman smoking a boge. 

Keep going- it takes time to master a skill & the 'struggle' never ends as there's always a new challenge. Focus on the challenge you would like to conquer & look forward to the ones that lie ahead of you. This means you're improving. Don't give up."
5917,"Hey, no problem! Glad you got inspired :)"
5918,Welp this sounds like it would be absolutely beautiful & glamourus. What kinds of things do you paint with glitter? Do you have any examples you'd like to share?
5919,"I love this comment! My dilemma is that I'm interested in sooo many areas and want to learn them all at once and don't know how to choose. This gave me some hope on not stressing over choosing, but naturally goaling with what I'm drawn to. Taking classes is a great idea and something I'd love to do once things settle down in the world."

5923,"Totally don‚Äôt stress over it! Too many people strive to be the perfect master of something. It causes you to lose creativity, flow and fun because you are stressed over achieving this one specific thing. Not that it can‚Äôt be great to make a long term, huge project. It‚Äôs just that half the joy is that natural evolution and exploration. In the meantime, many teaching resources are being made free right now. I‚Äôm not in the loop anymore, I‚Äôm on disability and haven‚Äôt been teaching or I‚Äôd list some. Try some google work on art education resources and tutorials. They are intended for adults with a basic understanding of art who are looking to teach children new art forms. It‚Äôs a pretty user friendly, in-depth way to get some free knowledge and demos. Might help you peruse what‚Äôs available and get down some tutorial rabbit holes. You can then plan supplies and tools for when everything blows over. It would be a great thing to look forward to once this ends. Good luck!!!"
5924,You are an unsung hero of the modern world. Thanks for doing what you do so that so many of us can find some type of solace during difficult times.
5925,"Oh wow, when you said bodies I assumed the bodies of old cars or motorcycles lol, but nope, that's a human for sure! Your work looks top notch, thanks for sharing"
5926,My favorite is the rose! The style reminds me of a stained glass window
5927,Thank you! It's so nice to hear people appreciate instead of jump into rants about how they think it's grotesque
5928,"Thank you! It actually is supposed to look like stained glass, it's based off the rose from beauty and the beast."
5929,"I don't think it has so far, but it has cemented things I already believed like: 

* life is precious and fleeting
* I can't control everything
* the value of relationships and community 
* capitalism is fucked."
5930,I appreciate my friends a little more.
5931,"My industry is imploding and all of my hobbies have been cancelled. I was feeling pretty aimless prior to 2020. I am still employed for the moment, but that could change soon. I‚Äôm taking this time to reflect on where I should focus my energy now. This won‚Äôt last forever and God willing, I‚Äôll be around long after this is over. Time to change course."
5932,"Like, 2020, or the past twelve months? Because, last twelve months, my perspective has gotten way worse. And it was already pretty bad, but god, life sucks."
5933,"When everything is taken away from you, you realize what‚Äôs important to you and what matters."
5934,"Not so much the current pandemic per se, but the overall personal events of my life over the last 12 months have given me a greater appreciation for living in the moment.

It's important to plan for the future, of course, but assuming you've got the means/are acting responsibly overall, take that vacation.  Buy that watch.  Go get Baskin Robbins on your lunch break.  Take the Friday afternoon off to enjoy a perfect spring day.  Life is uncertain, so if there's an easy way to make today a little more fun, go ahead and do it.  You might not get a chance to tomorrow."
5935,"I was maybe a little on the arrogant side, thinking 2 masters degrees and a $87k yearly salary made me important. 

Day #17 of not having to go to work. Because everything is suspended at the moment."
5936,I have always thought the state I lived in was overpopulated with reckless idiots. Now this pandemic has further proved my opinion to be factual. It honestly makes me fear for my child's life.
5937,That maybe I isolate myself a little too much because other than not going to work not much shit has changed for me üòÇüò≠
5938,Life is utterly hopeless and meaningless.
5939,"- It‚Äôs made me realize how it‚Äôs okay to not have 100% control all of the time. 

- Acceptance is key. Acceptance is the only way to reduce mental suffering at a time like this, (for me at least). 

- structure can be a good thing and gives us a sense of purpose ..even though I don‚Äôt have to.. I am still maintaining the structure of my day that I had before we went into lockdown"
5940,"This year has made me realize that life is short (that sounds cliche, I know) and I should just go for things. Try things I wouldn‚Äôt normally do. I‚Äôve always played things safe and this year has shown me that it‚Äôs time to live a little. I just recently started working in a hospital as a CNA within the last two months, so I‚Äôm pretty new and worried about working during this pandemic once it really hits where I live. I‚Äôve told myself that if I can survive working in a hospital during a crazy pandemic, I‚Äôm going to dye my hair an ombr√© purple. Considering I‚Äôve never dyed my hair, that seems exciting! Maybe take some cooking classes. Maybe hire a personal trainer to help me get started with working out frequently, since I‚Äôm so lost on what to do. Maybe try CrossFit. I feel like I‚Äôve always done what people wanted me to do and I‚Äôve always lived my life to meet expectations. For some reason, things have just started to click the last few weeks. I need to do something for myself that isn‚Äôt just reading a book or baking cookies. If you have any ideas of spontaneous things I can do, let me know!"
5941,"Made me miss work. I appreciate having a job. 

I definitely realized I'm a live to work person, and this telework is my saving grace. 

I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have like some form of work to do."
5942,"I‚Äôm going to be less annoyed with people in general. Maybe.

Also probably have anxiety about making plans more than a week away like, ever again."
5943,"* I need structure and goals in my life and daily routine
* We need people. Introverted or not.
* Depending on your job for your livelihood and spending most of your time at your job is a pretty shitty deal.
*  Germs > Guns
* There's a lot of nice people but there's also a lot of dumb people
* Society is kinda fragile. Like if someone dedicated some time to try and destroy it, they might succeed
* What it means to make sacrifices and do what's right"
5944,You can‚Äôt assume that the following year will be the best one yet.  It‚Äôs not.  2020 sucks!
5945,I will never not vote.
5946,There're better things to do other than hanging out in air conditioned malls .
5947,Definitely justifies the way I try to live for the now because we aren‚Äôt guaranteed a future
5948,"So far, based on one personal tragedy and one worldwide one: the thing that seems like rock bottom really might not be."
5949,"It‚Äôs emphasised how important it is to love and enjoy every moment or at least the majority of your life. Family, friends and community means everything. Without them, a lot of us would perish so they should always be a priority."
5950,"These events have made me realise that all of these things that I wanted (a house, a child, my own business) would make life very stressful right now. At the moment it's just me and my outgoings are not very high. I still have a job and I am a creative introvert so staying at home is fine for me. I have good friends and family so right now I'm ok.

I am exactly where God wants me to be."
5951,I‚Äôm cooped up in here with my kids and it makes me feel so grateful to have them.  They‚Äôre preventing me from feeling crushing loneliness during quarantine.  Right now they‚Äôre reading and we‚Äôre going to make sandwiches together soon.
5952,"My old life was not as crappy as it is now. I am literally living in hell right now because of this virus....

I also learned being positive helps. 

And now I realize, I should always buy in bulk. I'm not sure what to do now since all the grocery towns in my area are fully overwhelmed with delivery requests as it is sooo that means, I'm going to try to venture out this weekend and also venture out to the laundromat (fml) Wish me luck. I wish I had a friend I could go to, to use their washer and dryer but I am sure that would be somewhat inconsiderate... I think....

I already was not a patient person BUT now I am definitely getting my butt kicked in learning how to be more patient! Like the universe had a hold my beer competition or something lol"
5953,"That to not be emotionally close to anyone is not a bad situation after all. Much safer. I still choose to care, but I don‚Äôt need to be connected even if it seems ‚Äòunhealthy‚Äô to others. I‚Äôd rather be closed off and that‚Äôs OK."
5954,"Don't save things up for someday. Use them, and enjoy them. When stuff started to get real a few weeks ago I pulled out my fancy soaps, lotions, candles, and dishes and I am using them and enjoying them."
5955,"I'm glad it happened in my lifetime, in my 30's where all we think about is rushing for $$$. It has allowed me to slow the hell down and relax, think about what really matters in life."
5956,"This is slowing down life for a lot of us. Stay encouraged, friend. Remember that there is always something to be grateful for even in the worst of times."
5957,Tell me more :)
5958,Absolutely. And when money is tight you realize how much you don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù
5959,We never know when we get our last day!! This pandemic has made me realize how much I do want a partner to do life with (lonely feels lol) but really I want to be established with my first house and a partner. When things in the future are unknown it isn‚Äôt the promotion I am thinking about.
5960,I don‚Äôt think 87 dollars is enough to live on.
5961,2 masters degrees in what?
5962,"I felt this way too at a time. Please remember though, help is always an ask away."
5963,"This is true. Your second point I relate to. There are just some things we can‚Äôt control or prevent, like a sudden job loss. We need to learn to ride the wave, plan, and act smartly."
5964,Sounds like a great plan!
5965,"There‚Äôs this rawness I am seeing in life. I sit in my apartment and think to myself ‚Äúwhat do I do if I lose my job tomorrow?‚Äù I know I have a job for a few more months at least. But worldly events have got me thinking.

I‚Äôve realized that I could lose everything but I know at the end of it I would be fine and could rebuild and I take comfort in that. We have to just keep going, handle situations as they come, and stay positive."
5966,"Same for me at 22. I had a big internal struggle of wanting more and more. I still have a lot of time and my 20s is prioritized towards getting established. But, I am also thinking of the woman I want to be and really wife is want to be which I am hoping happens in my 20s."
5967,Yes! I haven‚Äôt been spending as much money and I love that.
5968,"It averages out to like $43.05 a hour. I get paid monthly so if i work 40 hours a week, its a payline of $7,300. I'm a material scientist, and department head of R&D.

But. Here I am 2 weeks in to being technically unemployed."
5969,"Engineering, and Chemistry."
5970,Exactly :)
5971,"Reading smutty fanfic online has upped my game some in the teasing department. 

Made my libido a little more active."
5972,"It hasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve loved Romance novels since I was a teenager. He knows I love a romance novel and knows the release dates of my fav authors so I can binge read in peace. 

What are your thoughts on how it would impact a relationship?"
5973,"When I was younger (in my teenaged years), I used to think relationships started from chance encounters and you would just *know* that someone was right for you and you would live happily ever after with that person. It might be true for some people, but it hasn‚Äôt turned out that way for me. Also, family issues ensured that my notions of *happily ever after* were put to an end early."
5974,They haven't. They are in the same category as fantasy novels and sci-fi for me. I know they are not real.
5975,"I've found my current relationship has actually impacted my interest/taste in reading romance books, and not the other way around. I used to fantasize about romance in a way that I now recognise as pretty unhealthy and I've grown a strong affinity to the 'safe and comfortable' sort of behavior that tends to get sidelined in the typical romance story (not all, of course!)"
5976,My ex gf broke up with me for a daddy fetish erotica writer who lived in another state.
5977,"Reading through various BDSM romance books has helped me understand what I‚Äôm open to trying, and what I‚Äôm not into without watching porn. Something about reading it makes it better for me. 

Some is just entertaining. There is a LOT of freaky animal shifter romance out there and it can be a nice escape but I think my husband *may* think a little less of me for continuing to read these books, LOL."
5978,"Honestly, most have taught me the importance of honesty, communication and respect lol"
5979,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs impacted my relationships at all, not that I‚Äôm a big romance reader but I read a lot of different types of books and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever changed my everyday life when reading about romance in particular."
5980,"I‚Äôve been reading smutty books and fanficiton since i was like, nine. It hasn‚Äôt affected them any lol. The people i like to read about in books don‚Äôt correlate with the people in my life. I read to escape, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs fun to me, because it won‚Äôt happen

I mean maybe when i find a book that just has a bad relationship and it makes me hate the abuse / bad communication of the pairing and i kind of make a ‚Äúyikes, don‚Äôt do that‚Äù note to myself"
5981,"Romance novels have expanded my frame of reference as to what can happen during sex. I didn't realize how naive and boring I was until I read about what other possibilities there are, or at least what was considered ""normal"" enough to be written in a book. 

Reading erotica jumpstarted my sexual revolution. It helped me discover some new kinks since they describe how the woman feels while kinking. Bc I discovered that I have kinks that I really like but think look awful in porn. 

I think however that some (perhaps younger women?) might fall into the trap of romanticizing love bc of the books. Bc life isn't like in the books. There might be moments that are similar but it's just fantasy,  an escape. Eventually familiarity sets in for better or worse."
5982,"It hasn't impacted my relationships directly, but it did make me long for that idealistic romance that often doesn't happen in real life."
5983,It's impacted is positively. I've learned a lot about the ways miscommunication and over reactions can rip apart relationships in seconds. They also help to give ideas for me to use with my fiance both in romantic and sexual ways. And the spark they always talk about? I do believe it can happen as well as continue to be apparent in a relationship with the right amount of communication and diverse ways of having fun with each other through the years.
5984,"In truth reading romance novels only impacted my relationship in the sense that I realized if I felt embarrassed or worried about telling my partner about what I was reading then I wasn't comfortable being myself. 

Romance novels have always been a form of entertainment and escape for me and I have read 100s of them. Being able to tell my partner about the latest silly book I am reading should be fun and enjoyable, rather than something that makes me feel ashamed or embarrassed."
5985,Honestly that‚Äôs how I learned how to do a lot of shit lol! It‚Äôs rather descriptive. That‚Äôs how I learned my preferred techniques of foreplay and oral sex.
5986,Not much. It's a story. Maybe a few ideas.
5987,"It hasn't. I don't read romance books. They don't interest me, and I'm sure 99% of them have sexism and other gendered stereotypes."
5988,Any recommendations?
5989,"It makes me wonder if relationships in romance novels could be a real thing, like where the spark never dies. Or maybe it‚Äôs all just fiction and every relationship goes into the ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù and ‚Äúsafe‚Äù place after some time."
5990,"This yes. I have consumed 100s of romance novels starting at age 14. I definitely had a naive or unrealistic view of how romantic relationships should work. After being in the ""intense and high emotion"" relationship and seeing how unhealthy it was (but not necessarily realizing it was unhealthy right away) I now love my safe, comfortable, and communicative relationship. 

Since being in a healthy relationship I have moved away from the ""realistic romance"" to the high fantasy/historical fiction romance because I am able to enjoy the fantastical-ness of it even more."
5991,"I love Literotica, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs considered fanfic. Though they do have a celebrity category, and a tag portal."
5992,Depends on what shows and media you like! I'm always cruising archiveofourown.org for new stuff.  It's got just about anything you could ever want
5993,"My relationship is definitely comfortable but there‚Äôs still a spark. We have so much fun on a day-to-day basis, but it‚Äôs different because we have a routine now and unlike before, it‚Äôs every day."
5994,"I get that. I think it‚Äôs a bit unrealistic to think there will be a spark and butterflies every time your partner walks into the room. I‚Äôve been with my SO for 10 years. Sparks still happen and we enjoy them. What I enjoy most is the feeling of safety, comfort, and stability. Having someone to ground me in the chaos of life is much more important than wanting to jump him every time he walks in. 

Plus, sometimes I cry when I think about how much I love him. There‚Äôs something to be said for that kind of love. Romance novels taught me love can be real, and I deserve someone who treats me well."
5995,I get way more compli.ents when I have long hair
5996,"I did the opposite but I suppose it counts - when I cut my hair, a guy who used to talk to me a lot started to ignore me"
5997,"My long hair used to get a lot of compliments from other women. I still get them occasionally, but they used to be focused on the length (oh wow I love your hair, it's so long!) rather than on how it was styled or actually looked."
5998,"As a girl with natural ginger hair ( extremely long, down to my butt) everyone always found it extremely attractive. Boys and girls. Everyone was giving me compliments but it came to do the point when everyone mistreated my friendly personality for being flirty.
I do have a short hair now, i chopped it all off and nothing has changed.

Miss the hair tho."
5999,i had waist length hair for years and years. i cut it once I started my job to my shoulders and everyone started taking me seriously and not treating me like i was 12. im definitely more attractive with longer hair but id rather not have my coworkers being attracted to me hahaha
6000,I get hit on way more with longer hair. I wear it short now.
6001,Nah. Only when/if I mentioned my primary goal for growing it long was for my wedding (I didn‚Äôt want hair extensions) did I get some odd reactions but oh well.
6002,I‚Äôve had long and short hair. People have not treated me differently.
6003,I stopped getting mistaken for a boy
6004,"Oh definitely. For the longest time, I had my hair down to my hips. Always got plenty of compliments. Both from women and men. My ex‚Äôs mother convinced me to cut it up to my shoulder blades so I can give it more volume. (She‚Äôs a hair stylist). Many of the compliments from the people around me stopped. I didn‚Äôt care though. It was easier to style. After having my son, it grew again like crazy. It‚Äôs been less than a year, and it‚Äôs back down to my hips. The compliments have returned. 

I don‚Äôt care about the compliments by the way. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I appreciate them a lot and they boost my confidence. But I‚Äôm at an age now where if I wear a style, it‚Äôs because I like it and feel good about it on my own. I like it both ways. I don‚Äôt mind keeping  it long for right now."
6005,I tend to have my hair up and I get a lot more attention when it‚Äôs down if that helps at all
6006,"People touch it more when its longer. Otherwise I dont think so but omg definitely of short is about mid neck or chin, I never had any super short cut like pixie or something. But I have a lot of people who have reached out to stroke my hair when its longer and I wear it down"
6007,I've always had long hair. It's about to my waist. No one has really treated me different for it. Some people (that I know) ask if they can play with it. I've had lots of people ask me if it's real. Lol
6008,I get more compliments with long hair.  People like to play with it.  It‚Äôs funny.
6009,"I get more compliments about my hair when it's long. 
People, kids especially, touch and play with it when it's long. 

My mother is the only one who prefers my hair short."
6010,"I definitely get hit on a lot more, but not particularly in a way I like. I used to look fairly alternative, and I feel like the people who did hit on me were actually more interested in getting to know me as a person. Now that I‚Äôve calmed my style down and just wear my hair long and dark, I get more fuck boys and guys who just wanna smash. Kinda sucks."
6011,"When I have showrt hair, I look a lot older and people treat me my age. However I'm currently growing out my hair and everyone thinks I'm 16 when I'm almost 30 so I guess it works out"
6012,"Had long hair all my life.  In 5th grade I chopped it off to donate and multiple people then and even after i grew it back out told me how ugly it was. I didn't think it was that bad but gosh I already have low self esteem.  Get compliments on my long, straight, thick hair all the time and never went near shoulder length again."
6013,"I get a lot of questions about my hair when I have long hair. Questions about virtually everything: what shampoo I use, what products I use, care routine, etc. I got almost no questions when I did a bob cut."
6014,People like touching it it's kinda my mane I mostly have it to take focus away from my face which has worked
6015,"I guess I got more compliments when I had long hair, but I‚Äôm not sure if it was because the length plus the curliness of it, or just the length."
6016,"They tended to assume I was more conservative,  and they swore less in my presence. Men also hit on me less."
6017,"Not any real difference in treatment I‚Äôd say, but with long hair I sometimes receive compliments on it including its length."
6018,"When I had long hair, I'd get a lot of compliments for how thick and healthy it was -now that I'm bald (I started shaving early 2016, before it was cool), I get compliments for having donated it to make wigs for ill children. People find my lack of hair ""bold"", ""special"" and ""unique"". Some ask me whether I've cancer.

Men often grumble they ""prefer women with long hair"" and then they're all sulky and disappointed when my answer is a Dora-esque ""me too!""."
6019,Guys compliment me more about my longer hair and girls compliment me more about shorter hair. But treatment is the same
6020,"I've always had long hair, so I feel like it's associated with me. Because, of this I can't necessarily say that anyone has treated me ""differently"" because of it, but I suppose it's one of my nicer features and is often the point of compliments. I'm sure if I cut if off (which I've considered), I'd get less attention, which I guess is kinda sad."
6021,"My hair is long, people don't really comment on the length as much as just saying that it looks nice, etc. Strangers constantly assume that I'm significantly younger than I am though, not sure if that has anything to do with hair length or just genetics/skincare."
6022,"I've had hair to my shoulders, or long. No diff."
6023,Whut. Screw him.
6024,"You dodged a bullet, love."
6025,That's still pretty good. You put time and effort into growing it long
6026,"Same, I've grown my hair out long several times."
6027,I hope you can grow it back. Are you sure it was because of your hair they thought that?
6028,That‚Äôs a big change! Did you try tying it up in a more professional style?
6029,Same
6030,Your hair grew from your shoulders to hips in a year? That's impressive. And I'm glad you have the self-confidence to go for what you want. Many people would worry about how others would react to their changes
6031,Without even asking you?
6032,Just curious: do you usually let people play with it?
6033,Sorry bout that
6034,lol I guess both ways have their benefits right?
6035,Jeez elementary school kids are pretty immature. I bet you looked great but they were just used to you with long hair
6036,Probably both
6037,"I mean, time sure but no real effort put in to growing out hair, it does that on it's own pretty much"
6038,"Oh for sure, I didn't mind, it was just interesting."
6039,I'm on my way there. Most of the time it was. But i know how to deal with situations like those rn.
6040,"i did, my hair is very smooth with long waves and i used to wear it long and beachy or with big bouncy curls down to my waist. now at work i wear it straight and smooth"
6041,not shoulders -- more like upper back around the shoulder blades. But yes it still grew a lot. Pregnancy (and post pregnancy) hormones are wild.
6042,Yup. Just reach out at stroke it
6043,"When it's down I will. I rarely wear it down, though."
6044,This is true. The part that sucks is when I have to defend my out of state license as valid when I try to get into bars
6045,"It's a huge hassle to have. I miss my long hair, but I'm glad my shorter hair is so much easier to wear and style and wash.

So growing it in itself takes no effort, but not going crazy and cutting it after a few months does take some effort üòÖ"
6046,That‚Äôs good
6047,As long as you like it. I just find it sad when people cut hair that they like for reasons out of their control like that
6048,I understand why they want to but they really shud get permission first
6049,Oh I know. I grow out and chop off (donate) so I grow it until I get fed up with the upkeep and then miss it. I just was amused by the way it seemed to be being said that it was a lot of effort to grow it out.
6050,Oh I fully agree. But most dont
6051,So you‚Äôre helping people in the process too. Good for you
6052,"It has helped me before, but I'm very particular in the guided mediations i listen to during. I can't have anything abstract like ""you are a tree and your spine is the roots"" or ""your troubles are a balloon and you're letting it go"". I look for secular guided meditations. I don't use mediation as a spiritual tool or anything, just as a mindfulness/relaxation technique"
6053,12 years ago my 44 year old husband died suddenly. I was desperate to try anything and did. 2x's a week a friend holds a free meditation experience. Sitting in the silence was killing me until Bob said that he too struggled with meditation until he changed the way he looked at. Most of us think meditation is quiteing the mind. Bob thinks the best way to experience the benefit is to notice what comes up until that thought doesn't come up anymore. Frankly that change to noticing has made all the difference. I find I can sit still for 45 minutes easily.
6054,"I found it life changing. I used to think ""eh you're just sitting there thinking of nothing, it's not going to make any difference, maybe I'll just be less stressed"". But it seems to me that when you clear your brain of unneeded thoughts, it opens up different parts of your brain that have rarely had the chance to come out. 


I started having vivid dreams, lucid dreams which were insane, precognitive dreams and some other stuff was happening."
6055,"I prefer mindfulness meditation as it doesn‚Äôt necessarily require a lot of visualisation so if you get distracted it‚Äôs a lot easier to bring yourself back into it. I find a lot of the techniques that I use (body scanning, breathing, noting etc) are useful in every day life to manage anxiety and stressful situations.

There‚Äôs also no need for chanting or humming (just not my thing), you just need to sit or lie somewhere comfy."
6056,i got ADD sis
6057,I has helped me. My doctor taught me how to do it and when my schizophrenia is really strong it helps me to center myself before I make rash decisions.
6058,"I've struggled when trying passive meditation. I can't focus and I end up feeling flooded with all the thoughts I'm trying to push away. Ive personally had better results with something like yoga, where I'm guided through doing something that takes my concentration that's still relaxing."
6059,"I love meditation.  It has been a huge boon to my life.  It helps center me and order myself.  It also helps me with willpower choices, like working out when I am tired or having determination about a course of action.

It is also not for everyone."
6060,"It changed my life. Seriously. I started bc a friend was telling me about it. Her therapist had shown it to her and she was just telling me about her progress with therapy. I never sought out anything to help me- I didn‚Äôt know I ‚Äúneeded help‚Äù or wanted anything to change. But after my first week of meditating for about 10 min a day- I was able to cold turkey quit cigarettes and ADHD meds and by continuing to meditate I never picked either thing up again and made straight As which is the best I‚Äôve ever done in school. I DID THAT WITHOUT MY MEDS!!! I have never felt lighter, more at peace, more calm, more compassionate, more empathetic, emotionally more in tune, more focused, and less stressed in my life. Please. Try it."
6061,"I tried quite a few types and couldn‚Äôt really find anything that helped settle my mind. Everything was just boring and a waste of time and frustrating. Then I forked over real money for the original (transcendental meditation or TM) and am quite happy with it. Three and a half years now, twice a day. Maybe because paying up front gives you unlimited access to well trained teachers and I got a lot of ongoing help. It‚Äôs really different, is all I can say."
6062,Doesn't work for me for some reason and quite frankly I'm a bit jealous of people that make it work
6063,"I use many forms of meditation to keep anxiety at bay, and help with resting from the day and recovery from workouts.

A seated meditation at the end of a power yoga class is a different balance than a moving meditation (like someone else said) of running. A guided meditation laying in bed is different than praying throughout the day (I'm also a Christian). For me the end goal of all of these is the same, there's a moment where I feel a disconnect from the rest of the world and a connection with my body and breath. Sometimes there are more intentional thoughts like when praying, and sometimes I focus on sort of looking towards my third eye (it almost makes me go cross eyed lol) and let thoughts go like waves on a beach. I can tell when the anxious thoughts leave, and the tension in my chest and shoulders lessens, and my blood pressure lowers. 

Any of these ideas of meditation to me is to remind myself of what that final ease of thought and body is, so I have that to return to throughout the day, no matter what activity I'm doing."
6064,"I'm not very spiritual so I don't care for it in that sense but it's a good thing to do in the morning to start the day on a positive calm note, I need more discipline to be able to do it everyday tho"
6065,It made me depressed for some odd reason.
6066,I find meditation to be insanely calming if I'm feeling very anxious. It's the only way I can really calm down and let go when I'm feeling especially anxious.
6067,"I was really hopeful about it!

When I was a counselor, I even recommended it for my clients. However there's an absolutely massive caveat. It can be really damaging or upsetting for people who have experienced trauma, especially for folks with C-PTSD. They can even decompensate when they keep pushing it and trying it. For them (and me), distraction works better to clear our minds."
6068,"I want it but I can't. I think my feels are lonely livable.  Initially or the first time, you probably can't feel something, less likely you can feel. if you do it with stability, you'll see your own change and you can't believe them. Initially, you don't need longer times. 5 or less than it, enough for my opinion :) 

p.s: I'm not a guru, I'm just a yogi :D you will find your own experiences :))"
6069,"I would rather sit for five minutes in silence than listen to all these complexities of meditation. I am working on mindfulness, even just having a cup of coffee and being present can be helpful for me."
6070,"It‚Äôs great, I just never seem to do it. But when I do I enjoy it."
6071,"It is refreshing when I already feel good, but when I'm extremely depressed or anxious, it does nothing. I think of it as more of a preventative measure for mental health problems than a cure."
6072,I am someone who is always thinking about the future or gets clogged up by thoughts so meditation does help me most of the time. Meditation paired with exercise can really shift me towards a positive mood.
6073,Love it! Highly recommend it! I prefer moving meditation such as running on the treadmill.
6074,I can't concentrate :/
6075,"It has honestly changed my outlook on almost everything. I notice a difference in my thinking the days I don‚Äôt meditate. I heard somewhere that your mind takes in every single thing you see everyday, even if it‚Äôs just a billboard you pass while driving. So I think it is really important to take time to just focus on yourself and decluttering your mind from all the useless noise. 

The app I use is called Happy Not Perfect and I genuinely love it and I never pay for apps but this is one that I don‚Äôt mind paying for. One of the things I love about it is that everyday you have to write down something you are grateful for, and you have a ‚Äògrateful diary‚Äô where you can look back and see what you‚Äôve written every day. I love that and I feel like it‚Äôs helped me so much."
6076,"I‚Äôve tried the Japanese mokuso a few times, and I really want to make a habit out it, but I have a hard time clearing my mind especially with how painful sitting seiza is. If anybody has tried it and has some techniques for making it more bearable, let me know!!"
6077,"One more thing I know is good for me that I can‚Äôt manage to do successfully, at least not long term.  Meaning one more thing I feel guilty about not doing ‚Äúright.‚Äù  
Pretty sure that‚Äôs a backfire."
6078,"I started practicing meditation with a 10 day Vipassana course. I find it somewhat relaxing, but because of the style of meditation (silent, no guidance) I feel really creative during and afterwards. I also had very vivid dreams during the course, but I kind of lost that when I came back to the real world."
6079,Meditation opened my mind and soul. It guides me through emotions and keeps me grounded. It gives me a deeper insight about myself. Complete life changer for me
6080,"I recently started trying meditation, mainly guided ones on you tube. Went into very skeptically, unsure of what it would even do for me. I‚Äôm not spiritual so I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be anything like that. Honestly, I just tried to concentrate on what the guide was telling me to do, and the biggest thing that has come from it is I‚Äôm able now to step outside my thoughts and control my mind a lot better than I used to be able to. There have been a few times I cried pretty hard in the middle of one, unexpectedly.

This wasn‚Äôt a very helpful answer I guess but, best thing I can say about it is that I know it has helped me but I can‚Äôt really pinpoint how."
6081,I had a friend get very deep into meditation. It changed her completely. She was never the same. She was kid bd of ducked up after that.
6082,None. I don't think I would ever try something like that. It doesn't mesh with my beliefs or my personality.
6083,"I had to do it when I was doing group therapy for ADD/Anxiety. I was angry because I felt like it was counterproductive. However, I find that I do sort of meditate on my own these days when I‚Äôm really stressed. I lie down and clear my mind for a while. I don‚Äôt fall asleep but it is so refreshing. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing it right, but it works well for me."
6084,"I love it! Do it everyday, twice a day"
6085,It really works. It really helps your mental health. It's really hard to do consistently and well.
6086,I just can't. People are constantly telling me to give it a go. My sister has sent me a plethora of information on mediation and suggestions of apps and people/websites to follow. It's just not for me. I just don't get it. I'm bored two seconds in. I don't at all find it relaxing
6087,"Frustrating to the point of being off putting. I tried a whole month every night on a beginners audio course and just didn‚Äôt get to grips with it, and experienced no real benefit."
6088,"It doesn‚Äôt work, I tried"
6089,The more consistent I listen to guided meditations or sleep stories (on Calm) the more I actually sleep through the night. I typically wake up 2-4 times a night so it has been a lifesaver!
6090,It makes me really antsy and more anxious.
6091,Practicing meditation daily has by far been the most positive impactful things in my life and has helped me get out of those spirals of hopelessness.Through therapy and mindfulness I am trading feelings of shame/ judgment for ones of joy/quiet confidence. I'm also starting to incorporate more gratitude into my life which I've read does wonders. Good luck!
6092,"The first time I genuinely meditated was for a health and wellness-type class last semester. Honestly, I thought it was bullshit, but it was for a participation grade so I sucked it up and followed her prompts in class. And honestly? I felt much more calm on those days and even started using those breathing techniques to help myself calm down or fall asleep. 

I‚Äôve always had trouble visualizing things too so I tend to prefer breathing type meditation rather than ‚Äúpicture a warm ray of sunlight‚Äù but even without visualizing it still helps me feel more connected and present in the moment, which has been great at minimizing my dissociation recently and putting myself back in the pilot‚Äôs seat of my brain if that makes any sense."
6093,Not good
6094,"i don‚Äôt feel like it works for me. i don‚Äôt feel relaxed, i feel stupid."
6095,It really helps me relax especially during my anxiety attacks. I also feel that it helps me manifest things better and more consistently when it comes to the law of attraction
6096,"Pretty great actually. I had a lot of life changes all at once and meditation helped. However, it wasn't meant for anything spiritual or abstract. Just listening to the sounds of the world as my thoughts come and go.

Sometimes if I am feeling overwhelmed, I'll put on headphones with some spa like music, lie down and stare at the ceiling. Not really caring or trying to think of anything. If thoughts come, I let me have their moment of fun and then let them go.

It is a practice though. The first few times I felt awkward and like my mind would not shut off. However, I stuck with it; as I did it more often I found that my mind took less time to shut off. So don't be discouraged if it doesn't work or you don't ""get it"" the first few times. It's a practice."
6097,in my own personal way i‚Äôve meditate everyday for months and it really helps with mental health and also helps you figure out or get the bottom of and big decisions you might be haveing trouble with !
6098,"Don‚Äôt force it, let it come naturally."
6099,"It has helped to make me feel relaxed, just remember meditation isn't something which u do, its something which happens naturally, just like a trance of peacefullness engulfing you and taking u to those places of your mind which u never discovered."
6100,I used to sit on the shore and watch the tide come in and out. Eventually I had a life- changing epiphany.
6101,"It changed my life. I am now much more aware of my thoughts so I spiral less. I don't overthink as much as I used to and my anxiety has gotten better. It has allowed me to feel what I'm feeling without guilt or attaching stories to those emotions. I'm a much calmer, more secure person because of meditations and that has affected all of my relationships for the better."
6102,I has helped me whenever my mind has been all over the place and need a break from all the chaos. I liked it!
6103,"Well, for me body scan meditations work very well, particularly when I cant sleep. I've also felt that it helped me with my depression.

At the beginning,.of course, it's hard to be present at the moment, but as with everything, you must practice."
6104,"For me doing activities is my meditation because my mind is on the present.  I remember going 4 hours straight drawing until I realized I didn't eat and needed to pee. 

However, without activities a bunch of negative thoughts start rushing in."
6105,"I struggle with meditation and I recently realized it's probably because I have aphantasia, aka no ""mind's eye"". It's pretty hard to do all those visualization exercises when you lack the ability to visualize things...

I have figured out more or less how to do it on my own but it takes so much effort to maintain for any length of time I've taken to other forms of stress management instead. I just don't find it relaxing, I guess. I spend too much time in my own head as it is anyway."
6106,Amazing. Excellent. Perfect for grounding and feeling generally pleasant. I highly recommend it.
6107,Tm has taught me to tune out everything & everyone that is unimportant wherever I am
6108,"I love how people always say they can't meditate because of X, Y, Z..

Wether you have a brain injury, ADD/ADHD, ASD, anxiety, depression or any other brain thing going on.. meditation will improve your life. 

It's no different to any other healthy lifestyle change. If you start eating a healthy diet and don't automatically drop the excess weight, do you throw away the diet saying it doesn't work? 

No! I mean, some people would, but you shouldn't. Consistency! Even 5 mins can make a difference. 

And thank you for the reminder. I have no excuse now I'm working from home to not have meditation in my daily routine :)"
6109,Oh same those abstract things don't work for me. I like guided meditation but more like progressive muscle relaxation or visiting the senses of a memory. Also I'm a social worker and these are therapeutic tools as well! Its good to know what works for you and what doesn't.
6110,"You check out the app Waking Up by Sam Harris. It‚Äôs secular, to the point and there‚Äôs a new guided session for each day plus 50 or so sessions to get you started if you need that."
6111,"Thank you. I needed this to help.me feel like I could actually meditate without feeling like I ""didnt quite my thoughts"""
6112,I had many many concussions as a kid and forgot most of my childhood and developed ADHD which my doctor thinks was exacerbated by the concussions. After meditating I was able to stop any adhd meds and started making straight As. I also suddenly was able to grasp memories I had only had glimpses of. It felt crazy. Like I slightly slightly remembered that certain things happened but couldn‚Äôt form pictures in my mind and then after a few months I had the most vivid memory I‚Äôve ever had in my life from when I was a kid. It was like unlocking parts of my brain that had been blocked off for a long long time.
6113,"That‚Äôs how I feel about it. I really want to try, but I feel like a) I don‚Äôt know where to start, and b) that I won‚Äôt take it seriously. Any advice?"
6114,What‚Äôs a precognitive dream
6115,Me too and love it... I had a 10 day vipassana retreat and it was a game changer
6116,Same. I can‚Äôt stop talking to my damn self while sitting there. I start making lists and then go off on a list tangent and wonder why my foot fell asleep then I convince myself I have gangrene. Some shit like that. Lol
6117,Yep; me too
6118,How did you get started? What do you do? I need this!!!
6119,This happens to a lot of folks who have experienced trauma.
6120,"I felt very sensitive during my first few weeks of meditating. I remember crying in almost every session. It was like all these feelings I kept within me were just flooding out. After about a month, I felt a lot better and two months to see it affecting my day to day."
6121,You should keep trying different methods. It has changed the lives of many.
6122,"Try noticing what comes up. Stay with it, then try to put it down, I usually tell thoughts,  ""I see you thank you!"" If it comes up rinse and repeat. Eventually that thought will stop surfacing."
6123,That's amazing! Crazy what just a little focus can unlock from our minds.
6124,"Curious, what was meditation routine like/how long or often did you start doing it for?"
6125,"I definitely felt the same. My advice would be to not make a big goal of doing it for 15 minutes a day because that will feel tiring. Just tell yourself you will do it for 5 minutes before you fall asleep and if you achieve that it will become easier. If you forget to do it some days it doesnt matter, just do it the next day. If your mind wanders too much try to focus on your breathing and relaxing each muscle.


Theres lots of guided meditation videos to help you out on youtube or spotify also, it can be helpful but it is not necessary either.


Heres a secret I found on getting your mind to be silent for a moment. Close your eyes and ask yourself ""what am I going to think about next?""."
6126,Like when you dream of something and then it happens in real life.
6127,"I started with short guided meditations on YouTube some days with other days just sitting quietly alone. Sit with your eyes closed and focus on the sensation of breathing. This will be your object of focus. How it feels at the tip of your nose when You inhale and the lift of your chest and the physical experience of breathing. While you‚Äôre doing this at first you‚Äôll probably get through one breath cycle before your mind thinks something. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bored‚Äù ‚Äúis this right?‚Äù ‚ÄúDid I do xyz...?‚Äù  These thoughts are normal- the goal isn‚Äôt to stop thinking. It‚Äôs to bring your attention back to the object of focus which in this case is breathing but it can be anything (body scan meditations are fun too, you usually start at your toes and notice any sensations- tingling, warmth, numbness, if you can distinguish each individual toe, etc.- and travel up your whole body spending a couple minutes on each point of focus!). When thoughts pop up, our instinct is to latch onto one and following it through. When you meditate, your goal is to notice or simply observe thoughts and bring your attention back to the breath as soon as you notice you‚Äôre thinking. At first you will probably spend most of the time kicking yourself bc you‚Äôre thoughts have run away again but eventually you‚Äôll be able to notice a thought and return your attention to the breath right away! This practice carries over into every day life and allows you to become an observer of many things. Sam Harris said in one of his meditations - ‚Äúthat which can observe, cannot be‚Äù which to me helped with any anxiety. If I‚Äôm having anxious thoughts, I can just simply observe them. I realized my thoughts are just that- thoughts. I wasn‚Äôt anxious- I was just /experiencing/  anxious thoughts. Hope this makes sense. Be patient, the process of actually meditating is like exercise for your brain. When you lift weights for your muscles it‚Äôs a slow build and you have to keep at it. Same with meditating! Sam Harris has free guided meditations on YouTube and he is awesome."
6128,Wow I did not know that. Do you know why?
6129,I almost cried with the first one. It was like so vivid I just didn‚Äôt think that I had any of those precious memories. Seriously before this I would think back to when I was a kid and I couldn‚Äôt remember past probably 5th grade and it was like a that‚Äôs so raven (but in reverse) moment and it was joyful.
6130,"I only started with like 10 min at a time bc I had adhd and had never meditated so the first several times were hard. I stuck with it every day and worked my way up to 15, 20, 30 min sits randomly bc it felt too hard to tell myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to sit for 30 min every day‚Äù so it was like I‚Äôd do at least 10 min a day and every 2-3 or so days I‚Äôd sprinkle in a longer sit. I eventually went to a one hour class and that was awesome. I couldn‚Äôt believe when it was over. It felt like we were 15 min in. I slacked a bit when I started nursing school (even though meditating would have probably been the most beneficial thing I could do) and have recently come back to it. I was worried it would be like starting all over again but I was amazed at how the second I sat and closed my eyes I felt myself melt away."
6131,"It can be really upsetting to people who have PTSD and c-PTSD because that type of activity can be triggering, or lead back to rumination/reflection on their trauma in a way that is not suitable to processing it. It's just how some brains get wired up after trauma.

For those folks, it's often better to use distraction to clear their heads."
6132,"Wow, thanks. That explains a lot. I have a hard time with meditation and find I can only get grounded with distractions."
6133,"My best friend is long-distance ever since she moved out of the city where we met. She's also my platonic soulmate in many ways. I love her because she is like me in that we both don't like small talk and love to deep-dive into the intricacies of human consciousness and our own experiences. She is probably the most resilient human I've ever met and gone through more than any person should but when I see her, I feel the light from in her soul brightening the dark corners of mine and I can't help but get caught in her radiance. We can long distance make each other cry-laugh even just through text. God she is just so perfect hahaha"
6134,My best long distance friend and I met on Instagram.  We liked each other‚Äôs stuff a lot and ended up talking every day.  My favorite quality about her is that she is so genuine with a huge heart And we can laugh for hours over nothing. My husband worked a lot of night turn at the time and she was single so we would face time and eat dinner together.  Making the same thing at our houses then dining together via face time.  She lived in Nc and I lived in PA.  I decided to be an egg donor and your allowed to bring a companion.  My husband couldn‚Äôt get time off work so although  we had never met in person she agreed to be my companion.  We met in the Atlanta airport and flew to Cali together for a week. We had the best time.  It‚Äôs been almost 8 years now and we still talk almost daily.  she moved to WV so we make monthly-ish trips to visit each other.  I am going to the the maid of honor in her upcoming wedding. Not only is she my best long distance friend. She‚Äôs my best friend period.
6135,"Mine would be my best friend from Sweden (I live in California). He and I have been penpals since I was 15 and he was 16 years old, and ten years later I still adore him like I would a brother. He and I have gotten to hang out in person a few times- he stayed with my family for a week after I graduated high school; and he, my sister, and I rented an airbnb together in Finland while visiting a mutual friend who lived in Helsinki. There is nothing romantic between us at all (he‚Äôs gay and I have a boyfriend), but we really are like a brother and sister. He and I call each other at least twice a month and just have the best conversations. We are so similar and love all the same things, and I really feel like he‚Äôs my twin. Several of my friends became friends with him when he visited Cali, and he talks with them regularly as well. He‚Äôs in our group chat and everything! We all adore him. I told him that if I have a son, I‚Äôll give my son his name as a middle name! My boyfriend knows how close this guy and I are and thinks it‚Äôs sweet. 

I love that I can tell this friend anything and everything, and he‚Äôll always accept me. He understands me to a degree that only my sister, two other best friends, and boyfriend also understand me. We just get each other on such a fundamental level, it‚Äôs as though we were siblings in a past life or something. We have the same taste in music, the same love of cultures and history, and the same sense of humor (we both have a very absurd sense of humor). My sister commented that he and I act more like siblings than she and I do üòÖ We just get along so well, and every time we chat or hang out we soothe each other. We also have the same taste in men and love talking about guys together, hahaha. When we called each other yesterday, we had an hour-long conversation about dicks hahaha!

He is such an incredible, caring, funny, open-minded, and kind person, and I wish he knew just how much my friends and I all love him. He has attempted suicide before, and it scared the hell out of me, but he is doing much better now that he is on anxiety medicine. I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety as well, and though I‚Äôve never been suicidal, I know how hard anxiety can be and really want to help him. I worry for him, but he‚Äôs promised me he won‚Äôt attempt suicide again, and I believe he won‚Äôt. I love this dude so much, and if I lost him I really would lose a family member. He is seriously such a caring, beautiful soul, and I don‚Äôt think he realizes what an amazing impact he has on so many people. He has such a gentle spirit, and that‚Äôs a very rare thing to see. 

My favorite memory with this friend is that one day when we were in Helsinki, a friend gave us two day-cruise tickets to go to Tallinn, Estonia together. He and I both boarded the boat and just derped around- we didn‚Äôt make up an itinerary or anything! We both just agreed we‚Äôd wander Tallinn and do whatever interested us. The day was SUCH a blast because we just wandered and explored the town, without a plan in the world. We had so much fun, and it was one of the happiest days in my life. It‚Äôs so amazing to share moments like that with your friends, and it‚Äôs something I could never forget."
6136,"All of my best friends are long distance. I love them all because we keep our friendships fresh with FaceTime, text, emails, and seeing each other usually once a year. Some are closer than others (a few hour drive) and some are across the country."
6137,"I moved away from my best friend almost 8 years ago, across the country. I saw many of my friendships slip away after I moved but she was persistent and kept in contact with me as much as I did with her (not one sided like the others). Even if we go awhile not talking, we are always able to pick right back up where we belong. She‚Äôs made it to every major life event for me since as well (college graduation, backpacking trip my husband planned to propose to me on, my wedding, and so much more) as I with her. Our husbands get along really well too so it‚Äôs super easy to make trips with them and whatnot."
6138,"My best friend I met in high school (8yrs ago), and my second best friend I met on tumblr (5yrs ago). I am in California and she is in Arizona. I was her Secret Santa and made her a playlist and a gifset. I love her honesty, vulnerability, how much we can fangirl together, reading books together or watching shows/movies together. We‚Äôve met IRL 3-4x and I cannot see my life without her"
6139,"My college roommate. We live about 300 miles away and only lived together for less than a year but we still talk five years later. We were randomly placed and we both really nervous about it but it ended up working out really well. I love her adventurous side and honestly the fact that I can talk to her about anything. I do not make friends easily and our friendship, no matter how far away we are and how long it has been, has reassured me that I am worth it and mean something to someone."
6140,"My best long distance friend is a friend from graduate school. I got a job out of the state after we graduated, while she stayed but I am excited to see her at my wedding this year! We both have a similar sense of humor and are really sarcastic and kind of negative people. We dislike a lot of the same people and things and I think that‚Äôs the foundation of a great friendship hahah. We are also very different, though. I‚Äôm pretty quiet, shy and passive and she is pretty bold and doesn‚Äôt care what anybody thinks about her, so she brings out the best in me when we are together. Kind of brings me out of my comfort zone sometimes. Most of all we always pick up right where we left off even if we haven‚Äôt spoken in months!"
6141,"Rachel! I met her on tumblr years ago and we still keep in touch through other channels. I love her like the little sister I never had, she‚Äôs sweet and funny and I always love chatting with her. We‚Äôve always been there to support each other when we needed it, and we share a lot of the same tastes. She‚Äôs just such a darling and I love her ü•∞"
6142,"my best long-distance friend lives in Russia! 
I met her on tumblr in 2018, we instantly clicked and I really feel like she‚Äôs someone I‚Äôve known for years. 

I actually visited her this January and it wasn‚Äôt awkward at all. we were really comfortable in each other‚Äôs company. 

some people might think it‚Äôs crazy that I flew to another country to visit a friend who I‚Äôve never seen before (obviously seen pictures and videos of her) and to actually stay at her place for the entire trip (she kindly offered it to me), but it went smoothly and I was warmly welcomed by her family and friends. 

it was also quite funny to learn that there are a lot of almost identical words which are used in both our native languages (russian and german) haha 


I‚Äôm already looking forward to seeing her again in the near future <3"
6143,"I met this friend at an open mic night when he was visiting my city from Japan. We had a lot of jam sessions at the air bnb he was staying at with some other friends for the 2 weeks he was there. 

We check up on each other every now and then and send each other cool songs/bands we think the other would like.

I love that he's so thoughtful and remembers little things about the people he meets during his travels. He remembered my birthday and sent me a little pineapple sticker that he thought I would like along with some Polaroids of the places he's seen that he thought I would like.

When he was going to get married, he sent an e-vite to all of us in Canada and we skyped in to watch the ceremony. 

He's just generally a sweet guy."
6144,"The girl who lived down the hall from me during freshman year.  We were only in the same town those two semesters but somehow our friendship has lasted for almost 20 years.  We just immediately understood each other.  

She‚Äôs amazing.  Right now she‚Äôs super busy because she‚Äôs running for office, so we don‚Äôt get to talk as often as I‚Äôd like.  We just pick up right where we left off every time we talk or see each other.

I love her.  She‚Äôs fantastic."
6145,"Besides my sister, my friend from Florida. She's always there for me."
6146,"All of my best friends are long-distance, either 30 mins away or states away due to how we met. I could spend hours talking about each one and what I love about them but to keep it short, I love how they all let me be unapologetically myself"
6147,"My girl Elissa! Smart, funny, best laugh, honest very easy to talk to!"
6148,"My Best Friend is long distance at the moment, she recently moved across the country for a job. I'm so damn proud of her, she's a mental health nurse! she's so incredibly intelligent, creative and caring. I've never met someone so willing to help people. She'll only be gone for a couple years but I already miss her so much"
6149,I don‚Äôt know their real name but I met them on Facebook. We share memes (memebuddies) and we‚Äôve been friends for 1 year now. They‚Äôre from Pakistan (Asia) and I‚Äôm from U.S (North America).
6150,"My best long-distance friend is a girl I met twenty years ago, when we were both in the sixth grade. We went to the same school and walked the same route to get there. One morning, I offered her a Mike & Ike (candy at 7am?), she accepted, and we‚Äôve been pals ever since. 

I love her because she is unabashedly morose and sarcastic. She is very similar in personality to April Ludgate (Parks & Rec) except my friend is the OG. And she knows how to make me laugh! I adore her. We haven‚Äôt lived in the same state as one another in many years but we‚Äôve been able to make time for visits. It feels like our dynamic has not changed. We are friends for life."
6151,"There's one that checks on me fairly often. We don't chat all of the time or anything, but I know he is there and he's gone to bat for me a couple of times. But I've got a couple of great ones spread out along the US, and another awesome one in England I can chat with any time."
6152,"My BFF. I moved to the other side of the world and we talk each day. 

I love her creativity, her sense of humour, her gentle and caring side. 

Despite the fact we talk every day, she‚Äôs low maintenance. If I didn‚Äôt speak to her for a month, things would be totally fine. I love that when I go home or she visits me it‚Äôs like no time has passed. 

All of my friends are the same. It‚Äôs hard to stay in contact but when I get home it‚Äôs just the same as when I lived at home. I‚Äôm really grateful to have a wonderful bunch of friends."
6153,"My best friend moved to Germany 9 years ago, we been best friends since High school, we now have 33. 
She was always the friend who always motivates others to be better, if she learn a new language she will bring you with her so you can know that too, if she do gym you do it too, so I owe her so much of my skills and knowledge to her. 
Its hard to keep up sometimes since we are in different time zones, but no matter how far or how many time passes we are still the same, its like if we paused everything and then put play when we see or talk with each others.
I don‚Äôt know for how long we will be apart, but I know that she and I will be friends forever."
6154,"She's from Korea and I'm from America. We originally met on hellotalk since i wanted to improve my Korean and tbh i never expected to ever have a long lasting relationship as ours. After a few duds i saw her profile and she just joined a few minutes ago when i messaged her. And I'm thankful i didn't give up. What really made me love her (platonically of course) is that non-stop she would text me everyday, no matter what. Even though the time difference was difficult she made an effort to keep in contact with me and that really made me serious about keeping in touch with her. Heck she even sent me a present in the beginning stages of our friendship for Christmas and wrote me a really nice note too (i sent a present back of course). She wants to buy me animal crossing for my birthday that's coming up and she won't even take no for an answer ‡≤•‚Äø‡≤•. I really am thankful for her, i don't have many friends due to some circumstances and she's the best i got. She makes me want to explore the world and gives me hope that there are other people like her out there. 

She came in at the right time lol i just got out of a toxic relationship that was also long distance (if you've ever been in one you'll know what's it like) and even though she doesn't notice it she's teaching me how to trust and love again slowly.... 

Sorry for any typos even though English is my first language I'm not good at it lol"
6155,"i have a couple really incredible long-distance friends.  

- one is my friend f. we met through a community website in...2005? we have never lived in the same city, but became penpals and hung out when we were in the same place.  about 5 yrs ago we started doing a webcomic together, and since then he has become like my brother.  we don't always agree, but i never worry that disagreements about our art collaboration will disrupt our friendship.  he's so solid, he's always there for me when i need something, he's so fucking funny and has great taste in everything.  we have some really awesome traditions, like every summer he will visit and we will go to a baseball game.  we both have crappy real brothers so we call each other ""brother"" as an inside joke. 

and last year for my bday he did the most amazing thing - he spent 10 months putting together a surprise party for me.  he flew across the country, got all my in-town friends in on it, and even got a few friends to come in from out of the country.  i had NO IDEA and it was such a special event.  i watch the videos from it whenever i feel sad. 

- my other friend is S. we met online in maybe 2013? she came to visit me in 2015 and we have met in person a few other times.  we went to korea together, and she's stayed with me for a few weeks (we live on different continents).  she's so thoughtful and funny and so cute.  when we first met in person, it turned out we dressed the same...we really have the same style.  and we kind of bring out the mischief in each other. i love her for so many reasons. we've had a lot of the same struggles and even though we have an 18 hr time difference, we talk every day.  we know all each other's secrets. she sends me really sweet packages and sends me recipes and songs and always leaves me feeling super loved."
6156,"I have 2: one I talk about personal things or things I can‚Äôt tell anyone else, the other has the same sense of humor and thoughts as I do so we can riff and make jokes. I think the balance between the two is great, but I wish they lived closer!!"
6157,"my best friend is long-distance, we met online. my favorite thing is how we're just. . . in sync all the time; we joke that we have the same brain because we have the same sense of humor and the same interests and are often even thinking the same thing at the same time. we voice chat when we can (there's an 8 hour time difference between us) and it's always the highlight of my day/week/month because it's just nonstop stupid niche jokes that have us both howling. i definitely feel like she's my (platonic) other half."
6158,"my best friend is french, and i‚Äôm from the states but currently living in argentina. we met at a church conference a few years ago when i randomly asked her to grab a coffee with me, best decision i made that week. we facetime at least once a week, she‚Äôs spent christmas with my family and after i graduated from college i went to france to visit her. she is encouraging, spiritual, incredibly honest, and we both are bent on destroying the patriarchy. it‚Äôs truly one of the best friendships of my life."
6159,"All my best friends are long distance. Two moved after we met, and we keep in touch through text and occasional phone calls. 


One is a friend I met through MySpace and we've yet to meet in person. 


They've all been there. Accepted me 100% at face value. I could be me. Vulnerable, goofy, quiet, outgoing. Anything. I can rely on them for anything."
6160,"It‚Äôs a guy I met online and I love that he is extremely patient with me and very flexible and open minded when it comes to things to do together. We know eachother incredibly well good and bad and there is a comfort there that cannot be duplicated with another person. He has always been there for me and helped me through hard times and although we have a great connection and all that, he will always be my best friend and never more because we do not click on that level and we both understand this."
6161,"Two of my closest friends moved to London and LA, and honestly, they're still the most loving and involved people I have in my life. They're both super dorky and kind, and there for me when I'm behaving like a neurotic mess. They have the patience of saints, and I'm so privileged to have them. üíú"
6162,"My best friend lives a few hours away, I consider that long distance due to the fact I can‚Äôt drive and I‚Äôm housebound due to disability. We‚Äôve been friends since we were 4. We have not always been in contact but always come together. I became really sick and she was there in a heartbeat, no questions asked. She was Bridesmaid at my Wedding a few months ago and as I‚Äôm in a wheelchair she had extra work to do. She has suffered with tonsillitis all her life and at my Wedding felt so poorly due to the fact it had gone so far down her throat. She didn‚Äôt let on how sick she was and never faltered. She‚Äôs got the most amazing laugh, the craziest sense of humour and I adore how gentle she is and how much she loves animals. I would say that her family life hasn‚Äôt been perfect and I think that a big reason why she moved away. She‚Äôs my family and she always will he, she knows that. Sometimes the bonds of family go beyond blood."
6163,"I met my long distance friend on Twitter, her name is madison and shes just really funny and nice and really pretty too. We share the same interests and like the same band so i guess thats what made us so close. Shes always had my back and i will always have hers, im really grateful for her actually"
6164,"She makes the effort to reach out at least half the time, so I don't feel like I'm doing all the work. She makes sure to remember things about my life and ask about them. That may seem like baseline friendship stuff, but I have found it nearly impossible to find actual good friends. I recognize that during different periods the split might be more like 80/20 or 70/30, but it shouldn't be at an imbalanced ratio all the time. 

On top of what she does for me, she is just the sweetest person imaginable and goofy. Love her to bits."
6165,"My best friend of 12 years is this inconceivably kind and forgiving person. It took me a long time to not take that for granted, and even longer to realize she‚Äôs like that because she doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs worth setting the boundaries that would make her comfortable. She gives me the chance now to help her the way she‚Äôs helped me."
6166,"We met in NZ, I'm Aussie and she's Canadian. We got along from the day we met, meeting through another amazing mutual friend. We have a lot of mutual friends from Canada (When we lived in the same town at the same time but never crossed paths somehow!) 

She is the kind of person who just lights up the room whenever she's there. She always knows the right thing to say, and so so funny, witty and intelligent. She is also just so goddamn caring and empathetic and goofy. No conversation with her is ever boring, and I don't think I would EVER get sick of her company. 

I'm someone who isn't comfortable with a lot of people, I tend to have a small circle of friends, I hold a lot of social anxiety, I wish I wasn't like it, because I love people! But I don't think i've ever once felt anxious around her. I don't know what she picked in me to decide I would be her bestie in this town, but damn am I glad she did. 

She walked to my work early morning, after we had a big night out to bring me a veggie pie and waited for me to finish and then we walked back.

I miss her everyday so damn much."
6167,"She's in New Zealand, I'm in Canada. I love her because she sends me memes and we exchange stories about how awkward we are üòÇ."
6168,"I met my best long distance friend through my good friend's son's birthday party five years ago. She lives in British Columbia and I live in Southern California. We are completely opposite. She's a Muslim and I am an atheist. She and I, despite our different upbringings and beliefs, understand one another. We can talk all day and night and never get tired of each other. She doesn't sugarcoat, has a huge heart, and understands my dry humor. We try to meet up once or twice a year. We recently traveled to Yukon near Alaska for Arctic adventures for a week. I am grateful that we shared an amazing experience together."
6169,"My BFF and I have been dear friends for over 30 years. During all that time, we've near each other only twice, for a total of about 7 years. 

The distance just doesn't matter. I mean, yes, it'd be fantastic if we lived close enough to go out, etc., but the friendship is just as solid and precious across long distances as short. We're in contact via text, phone, or email pretty much every day.

She warms my soul, and I know I do the same for her. We can (and do!) talk about everything. Nothing is too trivial or too personal. We don't always agree, but we always listen to each other, always care, and can always share laughs and tears. I have never met anyone else to compare to her. 

We're both getting older now. She lost her husband in 2018 and had a stroke. I know in a way that I didn't when we were young that one of us is going to have to learn to do without the other eventually. It will be devastating, no matter which of us goes first. I try to make the absolute most of what we share, for as long as we have it."
6170,"Most of my close friends are long distance. We met in college as roommates and after college, moved back home. Some are states away and some are just on cities away, but it's still a good couple of hundred miles away. I honestly love how similar our sense of humor is. We can talk for hours everyday and just spend it laughing about everything. They are also incredibly supportive and just the kind of friends I hope my future children find in their lifetime."
6171,"My childhood friend who lives back in the UK. Even though she‚Äôs in Manchester now and I‚Äôm based in London ( when I frequently go back ) we‚Äôd still make the effort to see eachother constantly. I like friends who make an effort. I don‚Äôt have many close friends, but the ones I do have go above and beyond to make sure we all stay in contact even when we naturally fall out of it sometimes. 

I also have one friend from school who was my best friend, love her so much. We go to the same uni now and catch up from time to time - not regularly because she‚Äôs quite a busy person and her lifestyle is dramatically different to mine, but everytime we do see eachother it‚Äôs like we never spent that time apart. It‚Äôs just drama free with her because she‚Äôs got the purest heart on this planet.    

Only answering half your question here but the most amazing plantinic connections ive had in my lifetime where with those who just didn‚Äôt care what other people thought of them, which made our experiences together 100% authentic. I think when people are authentic, it allows you to be the same - if you‚Äôre shy like me initially."
6172,"Pretty much all of my best friends are LD due to me being a restless soul, I‚Äôve moved around between different countries and cities since 2016. They‚Äôre all great, we can call or text each other at random times and it‚Äôll be just like we saw each other last week. For some periods we talk more or less but they‚Äôre never complaining, they just accept that sometimes our life cycle syncs better and sometimes we drift apart. God I love them so much."
6173,My best friend and I only see each other like once a year because she's a professional sportswoman and doesn't get much time off. I love that she is the hardest worker I know and so so resilient. She is also very humble and has remained by my side regardless of how successful and in the spotlight she is. Love her to pieces and so grateful I have her
6174,This is so beautiful!! I completely understand what you mean about having a platonic soul mate. I‚Äôm so happy you both have each other ‚ù§Ô∏è
6175,This is so beautiful!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I love this! I‚Äôm so happy you two are best friends.
6176,That‚Äôs awesome! Technology is so amazing. I‚Äôm really glad we live in a time where we can be friends with almost anyone in the world because of tech!
6177,Wonderful!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
6178,Hahaha I definitely understand what you mean about disliking the same people- one of my best friends and I are the same way haha! I‚Äôm excited for you to see her at your wedding! ‚ù§Ô∏è
6179,"That‚Äôs beautiful!! I definitely understand what you mean about finding a friend who feels like a sibling- that‚Äôs how I feel about the friend I posted about on here, Lucas :) I‚Äôm so glad you and Rachel have each other!"
6180,"Awww that‚Äôs amazing! I totally understand- a friend of mine from Sweden has stayed with my family for a week, and I stayed with a Finnish friend for a week (though his family and mine have met once before when they were visiting california, and my father is Finnish so his parents and mine instantly connected over that haha). It‚Äôs awesome to make international friends! :D"
6181,That‚Äôs so beautiful! He seems like such a great friend. You both have an adorable friendship ‚ù§Ô∏è
6182,"Thank you, I am so happy too. Up until I met her just over a year ago, I felt I was searching my whole life for a friend like that. 

That's so wonderful that you know how that experience feels, everyone deserves to find platonic soulmates as much as they do romantic ones."
6183,Thank you! I'm really lucky to know this guy.
6184,I'm not sure I understand the question. What do you mean?
6185,"General question for women who have a small business in an artistic discipline or desire to make a small business, what's your story"
6186,That's not really a clarification of the question. I have my own business. I am also an artist in multiple fields. I can't answer your question more than that unless you clarify what you want to know.
6187,Not looking for specifics..just hoping people want to share what they like if they feel they can relate to the question
6188,"By women? Never. Plenty of positive comments on my shoes/outfit, though. Lol"
6189,"Never. Not once, not ever."
6190,It's never happened to me.
6191,"That's probably only happened once in my entire life. In my experience, other women (even women who are into women), don't tend to catcall or sexually harass other women in public."
6192,Never happened to me.
6193,"Never. Nope, not once. I mean I‚Äôve been in gay bars and a woman has flirted with me, but I‚Äôve never been catcalled by a woman. When men do it it is demeaning, disgusting, objectifying, and overall terrifying.

Edit: wow 100 upvotes thanks guys!"
6194,"I‚Äôve only ever been catcalled by one woman I used to work with, and she catcalled *everyone*. She‚Äôd yell ‚ÄòOi sexy legs!‚Äô and things like that. It was annoying and exhausting."
6195,"I've never been catcalled by a woman before.

And so, it seems, have (most) of the women on this thread. That's not to say it can't happen, it is just incredibly, incredibly rare.

This is because catcalling is not about romantic desire, it's about power. Catcalling is meant to intimidate women and give men a sense that they control public spaces, and by extension, the women who exist in those public spaces."
6196,"I‚Äôve only been sexually harrassed by a woman three times. It is VERY rare compared to the harrassment/sexual assault I‚Äôve gotten from men, and also tamer. It doesn‚Äôt make it any less crappy, but many of my friends are lesbians and are super respectful of people‚Äôs boundaries. I think lesbians/bi women tend to be much more respectful of boundaries on average than straight men as a whole (obviously there are plenty of good and bad people in each group). I‚Äôm a straight woman and have never felt unsafe around any lesbians/bi women who I have actually known personally. I can‚Äôt say the same for straight men I‚Äôve known, unfortunately."
6197,"never once had that happen. well, i mean i have had a homeless and clearly mentally ill on drugs woman yell at me? but it wasn‚Äôt sexual, it was just jumbled nonsense"
6198,"I‚Äôve never been catcalled by a woman. Not once
I‚Äôm a wlw and I‚Äôve also never done it either 

Men however? All the time"
6199,"Never happened to me. Not saying it can't happen, but personally that wasn't my experience."
6200,"Personally, I never have been catcalled or harassed by a woman. 

When it happens from a man it ranges from exasperating to unnerving. It‚Äôs such a narcissistic action."
6201,I have never been catcalled by other women.
6202,Never happened.
6203,"Never happened to me. There was a cashier that used to hit on my sister, so she just quit going to that store. I did have an older man (probably in his sixties) ask for my number when I was 19, which was really creepy. Even if he wanted it for someone else, that's really weird."
6204,I have never been catcalled by a woman ever. I have been catcalled and harassed by men. It can feel scary and it's frustrating because they can be total assholes and get away with it.
6205,"I had my lesbian family dentist make inappropriate comments to me about my breasts while she had my mouth open and was drilling my cavity. I was 11 and she was in her 40‚Äôs. Felt so disgusted.

Her wife was in the room.

I know there are plenty of kind, respectful lesbian women. This is was just a single experience of mine."
6206,Not once in my 39 years.
6207,"To add to this, I‚Äôve never been catcalled by a women. I‚Äôve been approached by a woman and felt very uncomfortable by the way she was looking me up and down, but she didn‚Äôt verbally say anything to me. 

Any kind of unwanted sexually attention makes me feel super uncomfortable no matter if it‚Äôs from a man or a woman."
6208,Never. I have been complimented publically by women but it has never been rude scary or threatening. It actually left me feeling good about myself whereas the things men say leave me feeling gross scared or creeped out.
6209,Never. Not even once. Every woman who has ever hit on me has been extremely polite.
6210,I dont know if it‚Äôs considered catcalling but a woman once yelled across the room that she loved my jacket :)
6211,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been catcalled by a woman, ever. If any woman yells anything at me, it‚Äôs usually they like my dress or outfit or something, and it‚Äôs never been in a sleazy tone or anything like that."
6212,"Their comments weren‚Äôt really sexual. It was more of a ‚ÄúI see you workin that dress girl! Yaaaaaaas‚Äù type thing. They were driving past as my bf and I walked down the street. It was a compliment I knew they weren‚Äôt expecting a reply to, so I could really take it at face value and appreciate it. 
I have had men walk past and say things like ‚ÄúI respect the (out)fit.‚Äù However, most of the time they‚Äôre talking about body parts or what they‚Äôd like to do to me. Sometimes they say hi and then spew profanities if I don‚Äôt respond fast enough or at all.

Edit because I didn‚Äôt answer your question: If a group of men catcalled me the way these women did, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be annoyed, but I wouldn‚Äôt feel empowered."
6213,Never happened to me
6214,"I've never been catcalled by a woman, but I get way more inappropriate comments about my body from women than men. I'm really skinny, and some women apparently feel the need to constantly make really inappropriate remarks about it. I think men are aware of the fact that they'll sound creepy if they comment, but women feel safer because they're women. I feel less unsafe than I would if it were a man, but I still feel hyper uncomfortable - maybe more uncomfortable because I don't know how to handle it. If it were a man, it would be a danger signal, and handling danger is more clear-cut than handling a loud, rude co-worker (I don't know if that makes sense). 

I also get more uncomfortable physical contact from women. I don't like to be touched at all, but women feel safe doing it; men know they risk coming off as creepy. In this case, it's uncomfortable but not scary (usually). They typically mean well and just don't realize that I have a hugs personal space bubble (let's keep this 2-metre thing going, aye?). 

That's all generally speaking, obviously."
6215,What? Catcalled by a woman? Never happened to me nor have I heard of it happening to anyone I know.
6216,Never happened before.
6217,"I have never been catcalled by a woman. When men do it, it makes my skin crawl and I feel utterly disgusting."
6218,"I can think of one specific time in a bar where the woman was drunk but still with it enough to be somewhat creepy. I can think of MAYBE one or two times on the street. Those times I think they were just aggeessively friendly. Like loud outside of social norms but not threatening.

Men - all.the.fucking.time. I live downtown and walk 2 blocks to my bus stop or 4 blocks to where my car is parked. Every.time.on.the.sidewalk. I try to ignore or sometimes be nice, bc the same possibly homeless dudes are often on the corner where my car is, so maybe they recognize me and I don't want any enemies. The problem with ignoring is that they get nastier when you don't respond and THAT'S when I start to get scared. I've been ignoring men yelling ""hey sweetie"" my whole life and I'm starting to crack and recently have yelled back a few times for them to LEAVE ME ALONE."
6219,"Never catcalled or harassed, but was aggressively hit on by a woman at a party. She was tiny and my boyfriend was there so I didn‚Äôt feel threatened at all."
6220,Never
6221,"I‚Äôve never been catcalled or harassed by another woman, I don‚Äôt personally know any women it‚Äôs happened to either."
6222,"I've been complimented/approached by women but never through catcalling. I felt a little uncomfortable on only one of these occasions because the woman was drunk and she was doing too much although my partner was present. 

By men, daily (when I have to walk on the street), multiple times a day..."
6223,"Never catcalled by a woman, but I've had several overstep sexual boundaries in other ways (touching me in ways I didn't want to be touched and/or not stopping when told to) and it's equally as infuriating as if it were coming from a man."
6224,"Closest I came to being catcalled by a woman was when I walked passed a bar with a shirt that had boobs drawn on it and a woman yelled ‚ÄúI LIKE YOUR TITS‚Äù to which I yelled ‚ÄúTHANK YOU‚Äù and that was that. If that counts, it made me laugh and brightened my evening.

Had I not had boobs on my shirt I can confidently say that comment would have disturbed me, regardless of the other person‚Äôs gender.

Edit: to expand, if a man had said what that woman said, it would have grossed me out. I‚Äôm aware of the double standard here."
6225,"I‚Äôve been catcalled by a woman once, she yelled ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got a fantastic ass!! Rock those shorts! You go girl!!!‚Äù out a car window. I found it hilarious when it happened to be honest, which I feel bad about because It‚Äôs sexual harassment and I should not find it funny. I don‚Äôt know why I found it funny at all, maybe because of the way she said it or because It was unusual (for me) to be catcalled by a women, if I was catcalled by women on the regular I would be super creeped out most likely. 

Anyway I don‚Äôt think anyone should catcall anyone regardless of gender and I could never imagine catcalling anyone."
6226,Doesn't happen
6227,Never. By a man? A million times.
6228,I've never been catcalled or harassed by a woman.
6229,"I‚Äôll catcall myself in the mirror if I‚Äôm really feeling myself. 

But zero instances of being catcalled by other women."
6230,It's literally never happened to me or around me ever.
6231,Not often by women in public unless it‚Äôs banter with friends. To the people replying ‚Äúnever‚Äù probably have never went to a gay bar. I‚Äôm young and attractive enough to get a look here and there so gay bars get annoying. Because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre women‚Äù a lot of other women feel entitled to my body and feel as if it‚Äôs okay to touch me when I‚Äôm not asking to be touched. At least with men if I yell at them or shut them down they usually back off or get offended and leave. With women it‚Äôs not catcall then touch. It‚Äôs touch then get offended when I say no or stop.
6232,"Uhhhh never? I have never been catcalled by a woman.

I started getting catcalled by men when I was about 9-11 years old and it actually decreased significantly after I turned 18. I've been called every name in the book and have been told every explicit thing in said book as well."
6233,Never.
6234,Not even once
6235,Never happened. It‚Äôs always men doing it
6236,I'm bisexual and never been catcalled/harassed by other women.
6237,"By a woman, never. By men, regularly"
6238,"I‚Äôve never had this happen to me, or seen it happen to anybody else."
6239,"It happened once. I was wearing a tight skirt I never normally wear. This woman and her friend pull their car over. She gets out yells across the street something like I have a phat ass. She started dancing and singing about my glorious butt. Then she pulled out her phone to get a picture. She was rather far away. So the pic wouldn‚Äôt have really shown anything. 
Weird experience. I didn‚Äôt know if I should laugh, be flattered or insulted."
6240,Never.
6241,I have never been catcalled or harassed by another woman.
6242,"I work in a strip club and I get a lot of unwanted attention from other dancers because I am visibly queer/ butch when I‚Äôm not dressed for work. I am a closeted trans masculine person so it makes me feel really bad when other dancers make comments about how my genitalia is ‚Äúpretty‚Äù ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù or about how they want to fuck me. I‚Äôve gotten those comments multiple times and I do believe I get them more than the average cis femme woman , but also maybe. maybe cis femme women are comfortable with it because we‚Äôre in an environment where it‚Äôs not inappropriate to be flirty with your coworkers seeing as we sell sexual fantasy. While I feel I‚Äôm targeted for looking queer I don‚Äôt think they see a problem with it bc they assume I‚Äôm cis and they‚Äôre just being friendly /having fun at work. 

Outside of work one time Iv been harassed by older lesbians at the bar who‚Äôve told me they want to fuck me bc I‚Äôm cute ,young and relatively femme compared to them. It just made me feel grossed out bc they were old and it was unnecessary and if was fun talking to them up until that point. I don‚Äôt feel as bad about it tho I guess just because they are queer idk  

This isn‚Äôt really sexual harassment or catcalling bc girls do this all the time when they‚Äôre passing a pretty girl they don‚Äôt kno and scream ‚Äúyou‚Äôre beautiful‚Äù or whatever . I feel like most women aren‚Äôt uncomfortable with that bc we don‚Äôt see other women as predatory so we understand it‚Äôs just women being nice to each other. But ya it doesn‚Äôt always feel that great to me bc I‚Äôm closeted and not a woman"
6243,Never
6244,"I can't ever recall a time in my life that I've been catcalled by another woman. Men, yes. But not women."
6245,Never ever
6246,Can‚Äôt think of a single time I‚Äôve been catcalled by a women
6247,"I‚Äôve literally never been catcalled by a woman. There have been women that have come up to me to tell me that I was beautiful, but they did it in a respectful way, not asking for anything in return. They don‚Äôt yell it out for everyone to hear."
6248,Never by a woman.
6249,"I‚Äôve had a girl who after I told her I was gay thought it‚Äôd be okay to grab my hand and place it on her boobs. According to her, since I‚Äôm gay, I‚Äôm must like that. 

I was livid! I asked her if she‚Äôd like it if a man grabbed her hand started rubbing it on his crotch. Since she‚Äôs straight, she must like that..."
6250,"As an adult, never. But I was sexually harassed by both boys and girls in middle school. The harassment from the girls didn‚Äôt really feel any different from that of the guys; both were scary and humiliating."
6251,"Never been catcalled but have been harassed by lesbians online, mostly on Instagram. And in my experience they sometimes will not take no for an answer. They will say things like ‚Äúbut you‚Äôve never been with a woman‚Äù or ‚Äúwomen eat pussy better‚Äù, or send me pictures of themselves masturbating to my pictures, even after I ask them to stop. 

Edit: no need to PM me to insult me and to tell me ‚Äúnone of us Dykes want you anyway‚Äù feel free to publicly comment anything hateful you‚Äôd like to say. Thank you for citing cdc about the women orgasm claim. All you did is confirm what I said."
6252,[deleted]
6253,I've been flirted with by a woman but never anything even close to catcalled...
6254,"Literally never. I‚Äôve been approached, but not in a disrespectful way."
6255,"I have never been catcalled or harassed by another woman. I‚Äôd imagine I would be a bit more surprised than if a man did it, and somewhat less afraid for my safety. Still would be upsetting, obviously. But I‚Äôve never experienced or witnessed a woman catcalling, personally."
6256,"Never. Of course, I've never been catcalled or sexually harassed by a man, either."
6257,Never happened. I've had women say insanely sweet things about my clothes/jewelry/hair etc. But never unsolicited cat calling.
6258,"What? Never happened to me in the 45 years of my life, even with lesbian friends."
6259,"I‚Äôve never been cat called by a woman so far, but plenty of men unfortunately."
6260,Never!
6261,"It happened to me once. It felt nice to be honest (I was catcalled btw). Her friend tapped her and said ‚Äúshut up‚Äù and she told her (pretty loud so I would hear) ‚Äúbut look at her, she‚Äôs so beautiful‚Äù. Made my day. Men catcalling make me uncomfortable because they look at me like a piece of meat. They also don‚Äôt look like they have good intentions."
6262,Never! I have been hit on by women but they have never harassed me.
6263,"I‚Äôve only been harassed by another woman once. It was in a gay bar, and she was 40 years older than me. I felt much safer than when I‚Äôve been harassed by men because she was less threatening."
6264,[removed]
6265,"Besides maybe vullying in school never. But I've also been catcalled or harrassed by men only a couple of times, few enough to count on one hand for sure."
6266,I have never been catcalled by a woman despite being hit on by many.
6267,Once. I was too confused and caught off guard to feel any other way.
6268,Never.
6269,Hahaha never
6270,"I can honestly say I have never, ever been catcalled by a woman, and I run in some very gay circles.   


Women have complimented me, flirted with me and asked me out on dates but they have never cornered me at night at a gas station and repeatedly asked me 'where \[my\] man is at'  


This is probably because catcalling is actually about power and assertion of masculinity, and not at all about actually getting dates/complimenting someone."
6271,"It's happened once. It didn't bother me nearly as much as when men have done it because I did not feel unsafe on top of also feeling harassed. When men do it, I immediately feel very wary of them."
6272,"I was only ever once really harassed by another woman who was drunk and I was dancing with my friend at a club and she just was so incessantly grabbing me from behind and trying to grind on me...it was very uncomfortable...I kept just trying to distance myself as she was much bigger then me...but she was sooo persistent finally I just got really annoyed and asked my friend to leave. I feel like with a man I would‚Äôve told him to fuck off and leave me alone for some reason with a woman I felt like I needed to be conscious of her feelings?? Maybe empathizing on some level. I could also tell when I‚Äôd reject her she‚Äôd just go rub up on some poor unassuming chick the same way. So I just gathered she was desperately lonely ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Edit: because I remembered ANOTHER time a woman also drunk...and again really persistent just kept coming up to me and telling me I was beautiful. I have boundary issues and feel bad telling people to leave me alone (trauma blah blah blah) and she was touching me and trying to touch my face.  Then she went in for a kiss and I promptly pushed her face away from mine and had to ask her to leave me alone..."
6273,"Once, but she was very high and didnt persist so fine.  Sometimes people forget lesbians were raised and socialized the same as straight girls.  Meaning men harass us too, starting from a very young age.  By the time I came out and are ready to date another woman, I was terrified of coming across the same way men and boys treated me.  Would rather die alone than be perceived that way.  I suspect other gay women feel similarly."
6274,"I have never been catcalled by a woman. By men? I have honestly lost track. The first time it ever happened, I was maybe 12 years old. Honestly it just makes me so angry, I can't help but question how some feel its okay to talk to people like that.

Edit: I forgot about this one... But my former co worker and his girlfriend have repeatedly asked me for a threesome on multiple occasions/sent inappropriate pics and videos even after I said no. One time she randomly texted me ""threesome?"". I was in a seriously bad mood that day and sent her a long ass text telling her I wasn't interested and that a normal person would just stop after the first time."
6275,"As a bi woman who often frequents queer spaces, it's never happened to me by a woman. Men have catcalled and harassed me though and that's usually scary."
6276,"(I‚Äôm talking about catcalling, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been harassed like that by a woman) Not that often, it‚Äôs more jokingly than creepy I guess. I think the intent might be respectively those too in my cases, so that‚Äôs why it might be like that"
6277,"I have been catcalled by women. It is very unusual, but does happen if i'm wearing something tight that shows off my figure BUT only if they're in a pack. Women walking alone have never catcalled me. I guess they just feel more brazen in a pack to call me out. I have been asked for my instagram, but I do not have one. Apparently, if you're attractive, people automatically assume you have an instagram.

One time I was waiting for my food at a restaurant for take-out, the waitress told me I don't have to pay because an older ""butch"" lesbian from across the room bought it for me. Flattered."
6278,"Well, many older women I've known have called me a whore or indicated I'm a slut for being sexually assaulted.  So betrayed as its every time when its found out or mentioned.  Not to mentioned being called a slut over having a dirty sense of humor whilst being engaged so.  Then being judged on clothing, even though I'm often completely covered.   

With men, I've never really experienced it ""it's your fault"" or such unlike with women.  I've gotten used to sexual jokes and stuff, its annoying sometimes but whatever.  It's only an issue when they don't understand ""No"" so overall indifference more or less.

Overall, I've had a worse experience with women despite being one."
6279,"Never but regardless of gender, catcalling is kinda creepy. Why not just say ‚ÄúYou look lovely,‚Äù rather than ‚Äúoi oi sexy‚Äù"
6280,Has happened to me a hand full of times but always in an environment where alcohol was running freely. When it‚Äôs been women it feels somewhat amusing perhaps because I‚Äôm not as threatened by the interaction. With men the physical disparity makes it feel different.
6281,[removed]
6282,I‚Äôve never been harassed by either.
6283,I have cat called other women before but I was a teenager. I have a habit (according to friends) of checking women out still. I try not to but it's maybe natural? They always laugh at me because I never notice men haha.
6284,Only online
6285,"Whenever I walk through my city alone at any time of the day, I get catcalled. It scares me so much. I'll run I to the nearest shop I can find."
6286,I was catcalled by a woman exactly once in my life. It felt...weird.
6287,"It's only happened a few times. It's not as scary, but usually still uncomfortable.  Very rare compared to men doing it."
6288,Never
6289,"I'm pretty sure most times when women catcalls or harass it isn't with other women, it's usually to men."
6290,"By women, never !"
6291,"I‚Äôve never been catcalled by a woman. And even if that was a thing that happened, I‚Äôd still feel much safer than when I‚Äôm yelled at by aggressive, gross men"
6292,That has never happened to me unless it‚Äôs my friends or family joking around. I have never had a woman catcall or harass me otherwise.
6293,"Never happened to me, honestly."
6294,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been catcalled by a woman before, but I have been sexually harassed by one at a bar and it was just as unpleasant and gross as when a man does it."
6295,[removed]
6296,"I was sexually harassed once by a coworker and verbally harassed by another coworker (coincidentally from the same job). I‚Äôm not a very confrontational person UNLESS I‚Äôm pushed over the edge. Then I can be really mean and nasty. But it‚Äôs hard to get to that point. The girl who sexually harassed me was super fucking weird. I was her supervisor and we worked at a restaurant. I‚Äôd help in all areas of the restaurant and sometimes would help out with washing the dishes. So, I had accidentally sprayed myself in the face with water (don‚Äôt ask) and she came out of no where telling me how sexy I looked all wet and how she wants to make me wet. I was like w t f. I let it slide. Another time, she came up from behind me and told me how I ‚Äúmake her clit tingle‚Äù whatever the fuck that means. I then reported her to my manager. But she tried contacting me outside of work, texting me asking me to hang out, told me she had a sugar daddy and asked me if I‚Äôd ever mess around with her for money. I blocked her. Kept it professional at work though. The other girl who verbally harassed me was some junkie who was older than me and always talked down to me after I got the supervisor position Bc she wanted it. Constantly tell me she would never respect me and that I was only promoted Bc I‚Äôm gullible and easy to manipulate. Every time I worked with her she‚Äôd say something mean to me wether it was about how I supervised or how I looked/talked/dressed etc."
6297,ive never been catcalled by a woman ever. Some girls maybe over compliment but honestly ive never had one bad experience with a woman
6298,Never... I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever really been catcalled by a man either.
6299,"Once I was walking on this stage and a group of girls said ""Damn she got a big ass"" loud enough to where I heard it. I was embarrassed ngl but Idk if that's considered Catcalling or Harassment."
6300,[removed]
6301,"I had a drunk girl at the WCs of a club come up to me and say ""may I... may I touch them?"" pointing at my eyebrows. I told her she could and after she gently stroked them she said ""bless them fluffy caterpillars"".

I miss her every day"
6302,[removed]
6303,I see. I however thought it would happen when women are drunk. Thankfully it doesn't seem to be the case.
6304,I don't even care anymore at this point. That's retail employment for you. Telling people I don't date random strangers is about as common as directing people to the hygiene isle at this point.
6305,That's a whole pedophile
6306,"That sounds awful :(

It seems that both men and women prefer to prey the young and vulnerable."
6307,The only acceptable version
6308,That's an interesting idea... Maybe I will try it one day.
