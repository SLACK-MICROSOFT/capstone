18,"Yeah, we're gonna lose a lot of small businesses faster than gentrification can take them as long as this situation is out of control, and probably all over the country too, not just in NYC.  Imagining a lot of commercial space is gonna be up for grabs after all of this and only the businesses big enough to survive will be able to buy em all up."
19,"Interesting topic, but I don't think any of these guys have ever actually been to Canada or know very much about Canada. The most outspoken dude, especially, seemed to be largely talking out of his ass. Canada only lets in rich Asians whose lives are cakewalks? He clearly knows nothing about Canadian history, about head taxes, about the Chinese Exclusion Act, about Japanese internment camps, about the dirt-poor immigrants who built the railroads, etc.

I'll agree that at least on paper, Canada seems to value multiculturalism more than the US, and that it's not uncommon for second-generation immigrants to speak the language of their forebears with reasonable fluency, but it starts to go downhill pretty quickly with the third generation. His example of French-speakers is an incredibly poor one, because the Quebecois are their own distinct culture that pre-dates the country itself. They are not new immigrants freshly arrived from France. Also, French is one of the two official languages of Canada, so of course there are tons of people who speak it! A large percentage of French-speakers have zero French ancestry, even.

I also disagree with their assumption that Asian Canadians don't feel the pressure to conform with ""Canadian culture"". I assure you, we do. It's probably getting better, as I don't really feel that my kids will be mocked for their heritage by their peers, but I absolutely felt the need to distance myself from my ""Asian-ness"" growing up.

I don't know anything about this podcast or how seriously they take their discourse, but I feel they could probably benefit from reading up a bit Canadian history or speaking to some actual Canadians."
20,"Yeah as a (poor) Canadian who grew up in Canada, I have to say all their facts are wrong. But maybe some of the underlying sentiments/themes are right... like in high school we were actually taught that Canada is like a mosaic and America is more of a melting pot. So maybe the conformity pressure is greater in the USA? But man they should do some research before they speak with such authority about Canada!"
21,"Agreed! I actually feel like distance-ing from Asianness is less of an issue now because how cool (aka fetishsized) Asian culture is now but it was definitely a problem back then. I bleached and killed my hair blonde all throughout high school! I threw out my banhmi, lo mai gai and xi long bao lunches all the time and opted to starve than have people make fun of my lunch."
22,">Canada only lets in rich Asians whose lives are cakewalks? 

Maybe it's more outwardly visible if you look at the rich Chinese international students at universities and the rich Chinese people buying property in Vancouver and Toronto. But there are also people like my uncle, who didn't go to college in a STEM field and wasn't able to emigrate to the US like my mom did when she married my dad. He ended up working lower-paying service jobs, and my cousin had to move around Canada and Metro Vancouver a lot as a kid. That being said, their standard of living in Canada is probably better than what someone of their socioeconomic status would have in the US. So maybe social welfare policies and income inequality are some ways Asian Canadians have it better than Asian Americans?"
23,Interesting take on the mosaic vs. melting pot mindset.
24,">I actually feel like distance-ing from Asianness is less of an issue now because how cool (aka fetishsized) Asian culture is now

I can't say anything about being an Chinese-Canadian kid living in Canada now, but I can give my personal perspective as an almost-30 Chinese-Canadian from mainland China living in Quebec who arrived in the late 90's. I definitely feel that the rise of the ""cool factor"" of Asian culture and the rising profile of filthy rich mainland Chinese has helped the mainland Chinese community here a lot.

We have a small community of middle-class Chinese-Canadians who are at least somewhat integrating; a lot of relatively cool, somewhat monied, and worldly exchange students, but not many of the ""assholes in Lambos mass-buying mansions"" crowd AFAIK.

As a result, I feel like we have a better profile than before. I remember when I first arrived, even the other Chinese communities looked down their noses at us because we were from the mainland, and we had to generally keep our heads down. Now, I see more Asians in general (and Chinese of mainland origin especially) enjoying life and carving out a place for ourselves in the mainstream, at least in the city of Montreal, as opposed to on its margins as ""eternal immigrants"". It feels pretty good, because we no longer feel ashamed to be Chinese in public anymore."
25,"Yeah, as a Chinese Canadian whose family has been in Canada for about 40 years now, my experience has been mostly with the Chinese immigrants who left as farmers from small villages rather than the new, rich wave of immigrants. I tend to think of the influx of Chinese immigrants as having different waves, and the newest one seems to be what they're describing. But a *lot* of us are descended of the poorer Chinese immigrants."
26,">That being said, their standard of living in Canada is probably better than what someone of their socioeconomic status would have in the US.

I'd way rather be lower middle class or lower class in Canada than in the US.  Way better medical system for the lower middle class, way better government assistance and government housing, generally much safer neighbourhoods."

30,"Any Podcasts for wfm? I need to hear people talking so I don’t feel so alone hahah

I want to hear good female podcasts that aren’t just about lifestyle and wellness please!"
31,"Anyone else feels like there’s more to life than being Asian? 

All my life I strongly identified as Asian, I would subconsciously make friends that were also Asian because I felt the unspoken connection of being Asian. I care deeply about anti asian racism and about the Asian community. But maybe I think too much about race, and I should connect to people outside of my race. Like on hobbies and interests. And tbh, I personally feel like Asians are way too cliquey and a little self deprecating and white worshipping, so I don’t really vibe with that. I guess I’ve come to realize lately that yes, I am asian, but I also shouldn’t let that make up my entire identity, although naturally, culture and upbringing plays a huge part in one’s life."
32,"Just started getting into drag culture, any other AAs to keep an eye on?"
33,"I gotta say of there's one silver lining to all this sheltering in peace, it's the proliferation of delightful live streaming content from my favorite artists.

34,"Uh, depends on how you break them and if they are made of plastic versus a wooden pencil. 


If it’s a pencil that pretty much doesn’t need sharpening, then you can’t.


If it’s wooden, the best way is to notch it with a filing tool or serated knife where you want it split, notch it radially if you can, and then fold it over an edge of a table or countertop. 
Notching should aleviate some of the built up stress your pencil would sustain if you tried to just snap it in half."
35,"Re: female-hosted podcasts...

Disaster Area is a podcast about, well, disasters (e.g. plane crashes, earthquakes, etc) with a female host. She's a bit unpolished in her delivery at times but she does her homework and the episodes are usually pretty entertaining.

Hall of Shame is new but really fun so far, it's a historical sports podcast about athletes and/or fans behaving badly that will probably be entertaining even if you're not a sports fan. It's also entirely female hosted. One host is actually Asian-American and was a writer on Fresh Off the Boat."
36,"Of course there is more to life and identity than just racial identity! All of us are many things. We are our culture. We are our heritage. We are our gender. We are our career. We are all the little things that inform our being.

We need to have lives outside of being Asian. We need hobbies. And it is good to have a diverse social circle because we should be exposed to many perspectives. I mean I wouldn't go so far as to say Asians are prone to cliques, though. Maybe you just need to meet other kinds of Asians?"
37,"Yasss! [Here’s a list of well-known queens who have been on RuPaul’s Drag Race.](https://rupaulsdragrace.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Asian_American_Queens).

In another thread, someone said to warm the pencil so the inner crayon is soft and won't shatter when broken.

Crap, I should have saved the caps off the pencils I threw away."

40,Yay thank you! 👏🏻
41,"> In another thread, someone said to warm the pencil so the inner crayon is soft and won't shatter when broken.


Really? I guess that should be okay if done gently. I could see how you could overheat the pencil and melt the pigments.

I mean, it’s not a lead pencil..most of those makeup pencils are soft as you have to be able to apply it onto your SKIN..how brittle could it be? 

Haha, this woke up the scientist in me."

49,this was a FANTASTIC book. I read it a few months ago and I was just thinking about how eerily it predicted all of this
50,"Well, we hope not. People do seem to recover from this. ;-)

I wanted to like this book, but I kept waiting to find out what the point was, and then it ended without me ever getting there. I think there were some interesting statements on human nature and modern life, but I like books where things happen.

The Book of M by Peng Sheppard I liked a lot more. It was beautifully sad. I didn't feel much sadness at Severance because, well, I didn't really \*like\* Candace. She felt like a placeholder. She was waiting for her life to begin, and then it never did. Or maybe it did, it's unclear."
51,"Yes it is. Reddit has been extremely racist towards Asians for a while ever since China became the world's second biggest economy, so it's not surprising that it would continue to fester and grow as the COVID-19 pandemic grows."
52,Also sexism. Men are often and easily called heroes while women are just “brave” at most.
53,absolutely racism
54,Yes. No surprise there

64,"Not that it should discount the topic in the article which is very valid, but let’s not act like she isn’t a middle aged woman who aligns herself with liberal values and yet was comfortable saying it out aloud just 2/3 years ago. Would’ve been a different story if she said that when she was in her teens or early twenties. It’s a problem people like her are far too comfortable speaking out about this topic. It gives ammo to creepy dudes who fetishize Asian women. The same dudes who are piling on racism towards Asian people cuz of Corona virus."
65,My personality
66,"Everyone will react differently to different birth control methods so I definitely recommend speaking with your doctor. I don't think there's really such thing as a ""holy grail"" pill that only has good side effects.

That being said, I've been on Lo Loestrin Fe for close to 7 years now and I'm happy with it. I started at age 17. Didn't notice any increase in acne (at the time; I get more pimples now, but I think that's an age thing), no weight gain. But I don't get a period, which yknow, is good or bad depending. Because I've been on it for so long, though, I'd be interested to see how it's affected me emotionally, if at all."
67,"I used to be on Loestrin FE 1/20, but never noticed any of those side effects or benefits you mentioned. I had no cramps whatsoever and pretty much no period, and that was always what I needed most! I have a hormonal IUD now, the Liletta, and similarly didn't experience any differences in skin, weight gain, etc--but it's approved for use up to 7 years I think! After a year my cramps finnally went away but it took its sweet tiome"
68,"I was on Triphasil (and its insurance-approved formulary generics) for many years. That was some good shit.

I took Ortho Tri-Cyclen when I was a late teen, and I gained a bit of weight on it, but my boobs grew several cup sizes. YMMV."
69,"I've been on several including Ortho Tri Cyclen, Tri Lo Marzia, Gianvi etc. I didn't notice any crazy side effects with any of them. I currently have the Mirena IUD which is I'm fairly happy with, I got it about 6 months ago and my period is just a bit of spotting now. I got the strings trimmed already but my boyfriend still feels it sometimes which is a super downer lol. Like we have to switch to missionary or something that does NOTHING for me."
70,"Honestly, nothing has worked well for me for a long period of time. At one point my body was so fucked up from the various bc I'd tried that I had continued bleeding for almost a year.

Now I'm not using anything at all. I just don't have piv sex and whatnot. It's frustrating but I don't want to make my body suffer anymore.

Don't mean for this to be discouraging, though! Hope you find something that works for you!!"
71,"The first BC method I tried was actually the Nuvaring (vaginal contraceptive ring). It's a thin, flexible little ring that, when inserted properly, is barely noticeable.  You keep it in for 3 weeks at a time, which in my opinion is nicer than remembering to take a pill at the same time every day. 

I once had to switch to the pill (Ortho Tri Cyclen) due to switching insurance and I would feel nauseated if I didn't eat right before, it really sucked. But with the Nuvaring I never had any issues. My skin cleared up, I did gain weight, but I also feel like that was just due to getting older. 

I never would have considered the Nuvaring on my own but a physician actually recommended it to me. I've been pleasantly surprised and used it ever since as much as possible! 

Added bonus, all this fiddling around with the ring made it easier to switch to using a menstrual cup! 

Now that I think about it, I guess there's pretty much always something in my vagina. Huh."
72,"I'm 5'3"", dated a guy who was 5'4"". We were together for 5 years. And he certainly never let his height get in the way of his sexual conquests; I found out that dude was cheating on me all over the place. ☹️"
73,"I think it's always good to challenge things you find attractive, especially when they feel pretty arbitrary like height. I similarly feel disbelief when friends--especially really short ones--reject guys because they're under 6'0. 

I do have a theory though that tall men especially like dating short girls because it makes them feel even taller"
74,"Not me, but one of my good friends. She used to want a really tall guy. She's been with a short guy for a couple years now (he's about an inch or so taller than her). They just bought a house together, and he's planning to propose. Some days, I feel it's a trait she settled for rather than actually changing her preference because she's also the type of person who set a timeline for herself - x age to be married, x age to have a kid, etc. She's mentioned his height a couple times. 

For me, height was a bonus, sure, but not a straight up requirement. Height really doesn't matter if you get along great in important things. It also doesn't preclude someone from being a jerk. Since it's outside the realm of something that can be controlled, I don't get judging someone for it."
75,"I’ve honestly never had any sort of height preference in dating. I’m 5’0” and my partners have been anywhere from 5’3” to 6’1”. 

Tbh I think height has never crossed my mind because I can’t perceive it. From down here, everyone just looks taller than me. I can’t really tell any differences."
76,"Height has never been an issue for me. I'm from a really short nuclear family. My father is about 5'1"" and has never had a problem with women so for a long time I found it difficult to believe short men get discriminated against as much as they claim they do. Not to mention, most men want women who are shorter than they are anyway, because it makes them feel more masculine. I think the shortest guy I've dated was about 5'3"". My current partner is 5'7"" and he considers himself to be short. I'm about 5 foot even."
77,Height  **does not even** cross my mind when i'm dating/courting a girl.
78,"Sweet. I actually signed up for this flu study and sent in my swab.

I'll have to give the podcast a listen. Thanks for posting"
79,"Thank you for posting this. Her actions have and will save lives, and she deserves recognition."
80,"Hmm -- so for me, I remember this being a thing in the early 2000s, back when MySpace and Xanga were really big. (There were a few other social media sites but I can't quite remember them anymore?) This was also around the time the first Fast and Furious came out, so the whole thing with driving modified cars was part of the subculture. Rick Yune's character was like, the stereotype all the guys emulated. I grew up in some pretty privileged suburbs with a large Asian population, and to be an ABG or ABB basically consisted of:

1. Wearing a gold chain

2. Boys having spiky, gelled hair, girls having long dyed blonde/caramel hair. Girls all wore COPIOUS amounts of black eyeliner, usually in a solid block of color that covered the entire lid. Lots of mascara, too.

3. Having an AIM screen name consisting of variations and combinations of ""AzN"", ""baBiE"", ""hOtTiE"", ""DrAgON"", ""pRyDe"" + ethnic group you identify with (KrN, ViEt, ChyNez, etc)

4. Owning a dayplanner with cute anime characters on it, and allll the milky/jelly pen colors

5. Listening to K-pop

I don't think this gentrification of the Asian Baby Gangster is a new thing. Granted, this is somewhat of an outsider's perspective (this was middle school/high school for me, and I was a big ol' nerd...) But all the ""cool"" Asian kids/Asian cliques were deep into this AzN bABiii gAnGstA aesthetic."
81," Everything you say is true, but for me it's just same shit different day. Look at how many fads in mainstream uppity class signaling conspicuous consumption culture are just lite pop spinoffs of the culture of poor black people. This is how the fashion cycle works. Save yourself some stress and ignore these shallow fools if it's too annoying or otherwise just let people do what they like. Some teenybopper who likes a hairstyle and a YouTube star doesn't need to be burdened too much with the trials of the past over their fashion sense. However, everybody should understand issues of social justice, even when it's not our fault we need to appreciate it so that we don't excessively perpetuate it."

least she is recognized as being the best female figure skater of that era, and someone
who was incredibly graceful and artistic when Asians are still stereotyped as being
uncreative robots. It's great to see her doing well so many years later.

I don't know much about figure skating, but I've noticed Asian-Americans currently make
up a significant proportion of the best figure skaters in the U.S. I dated a former
figure skater from the South and she told me she saw lots of Asian-American girls at the
rink (she herself is not Asian). I'm guessing Michelle Kwan and Kristi Yamaguchi had a

107,It's frightening to see how quickly people are jumping on this opportunity to openly show their racism towards asians. I've heard so much shit from people I would have never expected it from. It's scary and upsetting and it's not being taken seriously. A friend of mine was physically assaulted in broad daylight just recently.

If we don’t act like what docile little pet they envision us to be, imagine what racism and misogyny fueled abuse look like. If that’s the trade off for being desirable, hard pass from me"
112,Pretty much r/aznidentity
113,"This tweet was part of a slightly larger tweet thread in response to that Andrew Kung photobook about Asian male desirability (which is admittedly a dumb, played out topic) in which she said the ""NYC Asian American artist community"" (intentionally vague 'authority') was platforming an MRA for publishing the book. Kung doesn't talk about Asian women in his interview aside from the generic ""the intersection of gender and race isn't talked about in our community"" blurb. Not sure how he's an MRA and not like, someone who works for buzzfeed. 

Also doesn't this argument essentially fold back pretty nicely into the Asian incel argument about why people should be wary of Asian women dating white people (just noticed it's white women for asian men and white ppl for asian women) and kind of justify why they feel they can be toxic and justify it using ""activist language"" in the first place?"
114,SAT is a total shit show. 80% of the people over there don't even know what racial micro-aggressions are.

123,"*Tell your stories!*

I studied public health in grad school right before the HPV vaccine came out. There was a lot of hype behind it because the papers coming from the clinical trials all showed amazing successes. Given the prevalence of HPV at the time, 70-80% of adult women, a vaccine like showed enormous promise.

Quadrivalent Gardasil was licensed in the US in 2005 for women between the ages of 11 and 26. It was a series of 3 doses, but because it was new, the cost was $150 per dose out of pocket. I barely made the age cutoff, so I requested it as soon as it was available. As far as shots go, this one was a real punch in the arm. But no injection site irritation, no fainting, no side effects to speak of.

Fifteen years out, I still don't have HPV. My cervix is normal and healthy. I still get Pap smears as recommended. I recommend this vaccine to everyone who is medically eligible for it.

Cervical cancer is a leading killer of Asian women. Stigma keeps Asian women from getting adequate reproductive health care. Break through the stigma and educate others in our community to get vaccinated against HPV, to get regular Pap smears, and to get STD screens as needed."
124,Thanks for sharing! I was in high school when it became available here and it was free for all high school students and still is as part of the National HPV Program.

128,"I just spent a month in this part of Italy over the winter. I could only imagine how people might treat me if I were there now. Dammit, people can be so cruel."
129,I'm going to europe soon and I'm more worried about the racism than the virus
130,Not surprised. Just look at all the headlines about racism towards football players playing on Italian club teams. Italy has a reputation of being racist.
131,">Italy has a reputation of being racist.

FWIW, I have always been on the lookout for this when I travel, but my experiences have always been so good. It breaks my heart to know that the difference in how people would treat me could shift so radically in less than 2 months.

>racism towards football players playing on Italian club teams.

Yeah, this is the height of absurdity. Like, your team's best player is black, so naturally you have to insult him, even though he is literally making your team better. They say racism is irrational, indeed."
132,"I think Asian beauty standards are ridiculously strict and oppressive too, and I agree with most of this article, but damn:

> an obsessive beauty standard where everyone ends up looking like pale, petite, and stick-thin clones.

Is it necessary to put down another body type in a body-positive article? According to this, a large part of the Asian population are pale, petite, and stick-thin clones? Sounds like what some white people say about us, and coming from an Asian writer, that's disappointing."
133,"First thing two aunties who hadn't seen me since I was 11 said was ""oh you've gained weight."" Yes of course I have since I was 11 years old 🙃🙃 then, if you try to eat just one plate: ""stop wasting food"" / ""don't be disrespectful or hurt my feelings"" etc."
134,My weight is still a major source of my insecurities. I still have this mindset that if I would just lose X amount of weight then I’d be perfect. I have never felt comfortable in my own skin and with myself until I started to exercise and begin to manage my own body (while also maintaining low contact with my family). I feel like my weight was just always something I felt like made me inherently unworthy of anything and I was so terrified to visit family in China because of it.
135,"I've definitely gotten a lot of criticism from my family members for not being being slender. On my dad's birthday, he told me to eat a smaller slice of cake because he thought I was fat and should exercise more. Yet, I'm the only one in the family who actually exercises regularly...sorry I didn't inherit your naturally skinny genes."
136,"Agreeeeeed. We're all grown ups, we can talk about oppressive beauty standards without putting down other body types. I've never even met another Asian woman, even with the ""ideal body types"", completely 100% happy about how they look or with their marital status. There's always something we're conditioned to feel bad about because even once the weight is shed, something else can be pointed out."
137,"As someone who has been shamed for being fat and is now shamed for being thin (not just by family), I agree!"
138,"genes are a questionable point. Where i live, most women are around a size 2, maxing out at 4 at most. And these include mothers who have been thru multiple pregnancies, or recent pregnancies. And the secret for this slenderness is holding themselves to celebrity standards and diets."
139,"Not to mention that many people in Asia are ""petite"" and ""stick-thin"" because they're poor & malnourished, or do manual labour, or both. It's not just about body image here. I don't know if that thought even passed the author's mind - that many parts of Asia are still impoverished? I think that many 1st and 2nd gen Asian people in first world Western countries have certain financial security and privilege that aren't afforded to a large population of Asia. Access to food security and nutrition isn't granted to everyone. If many Asian immigrants were refugees fleeing wars, genocides, and oppressive regimes while others left to find better economic opportunities than they had back home, then what about the vast majority people who couldn't leave those circumstances? Those words are doubly insensitive and hurtful when you look at those people's reality."
140,What I meant was that most people in my immediate family do not exercise or diet and are naturally thin.
141,"Wait-- I don't think not mentioning socioeconomic factors in the original article necessarily means the author is only speaking to a 1st/2nd gen western/privileged perspective. There are plenty of non-western asians who face this as well, in varying financial statuses. If I took anything from the article, it's that ""fat asians"" are almost conceptually non-existent by what appears to be cultural exclusion. That kind of invisibility can be a lifelong hurt."

145,I think an important question would be: does Emilia Clarke identify as a South Asian woman? Does she face the experiences and barriers that South Asian women do? This is a tricky topic and hard to navigate without gatekeeping 😅
146,"I recently learned that the author Lisa See, who is super well known for her Chinese historical fiction, is 'only' 1/8 Chinese and physically doesn't read as Chinese. She actually addresses this on her [website](https://www.lisasee.com/faq/) and I think gives a really thoughtful introspection:

>This kind of question is very hard for me to answer. What makes you Chinese? Is it how you look, how you feel inside, how you raise your children? Most people don’t have to answer this type of question, but because I don’t look Chinese, I do. (Although I have to tell you that if you saw me with my full-blood Chinese relatives, you’d see that I look very similar to them. We are the same height, the same build, the same proportions from ankle to knee, hip to shoulder. I have the same jaw and the same eyes as my great-grandfather. Only my coloring is different.)

>Anyway, to answer your question, my Chinese background influences everything in my life. It’s in how I raise my children, in what I eat, in how I remember the people in my family who’ve died. It’s in what I plant in my garden and how I decorate my house. I have a western doctor, but my main doctor is from China and practices traditional Chinese medicine.

>But because of how I look I will always be “outside.” In Los Angeles Chinatown, people know me, but when I go to other Chinese communities or to China, people see me as an outsider. When I go into the larger white community here in the U.S., people look at me and talk to me as though I belong, but inside I often feel very foreign. I don’t like their bigotry and racism. In both worlds, I’m a bit outside. I think this has made me a better— and certainly more interesting—writer, because it really makes me look and feel."
147,"Ethnic and cultural background is one thing, but race is a construct - frankly, if ___ is not how you're read in daily life by the average person, it's not your race.

People were all on the Emilia Clarke is a white savior boat when she was in GoT, and this revelation doesn't change a thing."
148,Who's calling Emilia Clarke a south Asian woman? 1/8 hardly counts... it's like Elizabeth Warren calling herself Native American.
149,"This is tricky but I think you have the right idea. She doesn't actively ID as South Asian and hasn't spoken about its effect on her life or anything, so I think it's safe to assume she doesn't even consider herself South Asian.

The passing thing is tougher because after a certain point it's not just about skin tone/features, it's also about cultural stuff... Like for example maybe you look more white but people made fun of you in school for bringing Asian food for lunch or displayed prejudice because of your foreign name. If a white-passing person is raised with their Asian cultural practices they may identify strongly with those and face prejudice etc. due to that."
150,I think the closest comparison would be to Keanu Reeves. He is a 1/4 AAPI but I don't think it was that widely known until Ali Wong brought it up with the *Always Be My Maybe* press tour. It seems like Reeves has only really brought up his AAPI heritage when he was trying to promote some ninja film that he was in (and he's not even Japanese).
151,"I think if other people don’t see you as a certain race then you can’t really Identify as that race. I mean, why would you? How much contact with that 1/8 of your heritage are you really going to have? It’s kind of like people romanticizing the ethnic experience without actually having to live it themselves."
152,"I think even entertaining the question of whether or not Emilia Clarke (and a lot of discussion re: what race someone “chooses to identify as”) is Asian requires some kind orientalization or assumption about race being an inherent, unchangeable essence."
153,thank you for sharing! it's great to see her articulate it so well.
154,"I don't think it's quite fair to say that if you don't pass as a certain race, it's not your race."
155,"Except that in Elizabeth Warren’s case 1. Cherokee isn’t just a racial group that follows western “1-drop” ideology and 2. Her claims were false.

I don’t consider it to be the worlds biggest deal, but it’s weird when it gets minimized."
156,It’s pretty common knowledge that Keanu Reeves mixed race Asian American. He’s talked about how he was largely raised by his Chinese grandmother and he has a Hawaiian name - I think it’s safe to say he grew up influenced by his AA/PI roots.
157,"It gets tricky with white-passing people though. Darren Criss is half-Filipino and Norah Jones is half-Indian but both look white. And for a lot of half-black, half-Asian people, it might be even harder to tell."
158,"Without getting into the murky and fraught details of gatekeeping race, I think - in this case - it's ridiculous to say Emilia Clarke is a white-passing brown woman.

Please keep in mind, I'm explicitly trying to not conflate racial construct with heritage/ethnic background."
159,I agree and I think that's generally a way of erasing HAPA identities. However this feels different - she is not only white passing but has *also* never really acknowledged her South Asian heritage afaik.
160,"Elizabeth warren’s claims weren’t false, she did a DNA test and she did have Native American heritage, but like 1/16 or 1/32. I’ve read that she was grew up being told that she has Native American blood and to remember that. I think that’s fine but people are upset that she applied to something saying she’s Native American. I think it was done innocently since that was what she knew to be her family history but I can see where people have issues. 

But that’s another kind of gatekeeping. If someone has been told to remember that part of their life, and this was before the age of DNA tests, then who are we to say that no, you are not this or that."
161,If someone is half and they look white then I don't blame them for bringing it up. If someone is a quarter maaaybe I can see that they knew their grandparents or whatever and identifies with that race. But anything less than that I'm skeptical. Especially if I can't see the ethnic features at all.
162,"I wasn't thinking of Emilia specifically in my reply. As far as I know, she chooses not to identify as anything but white."
163,"Yeah, I don't think she identifies as anything but white."
164,"First, genetics are not what make you Cherokee. There are tons of Cherokee people, and they decide what makes you Cherokee, and she doesn’t have that thing. I’m not an expert, but they all say her family story is not true. 

> who are we to say that no, you are not this or that.

Cherokees are who. Call it gatekeeping: they want a gate, so they get one. It was not before the age of DNA tests - it was both before and after the age of DNA tests. This came up in 2012 as a controversy and she was still doubling down in 2018.

Second, her (1/32) genetic testing was within the error range for the test, so the test literally does not provide evidence for (or against) her having Cherokee heritage.

I’m not trying to make this a big deal! It’s just not nothing. Please stop acting like it’s nothing."
165,"The point about certain minority mixes being treated as inequivalent is a big one though. 

White/Asian mixed people often read as one or the other, but Black/Asian mixed people are far more often read by others as black and only black. But both hypothetical people could have one 100% Asian parent and grow up with the same cultural influences. 

There’s also passing in person vs passing on paper. Darren Criss and Norah Jones both pass on person and on paper. But if someone sees Alexa Chung’s name without context in an email or on a job application, they’re going to picture a Chinese woman and act accordingly. The opposite would be true for Shannon Williams."
166,"Idk what this whole thread is about then. OP specifically is framing this issue around Emilia Clarke, maybe including other white-identifying, white-passing women with 1/8 Asian ethnic makeup.

I'm not trying to expand this to other mixed Asians.

If we are speaking more generally, I'm of the opinion that you either experience being of a race or you don't, which has nothing to do with your actual ethnic makeup and racial perception also varies regionally: which is all to say it's all fucked up and made up to begin with."
167,"Yeah, my point was more about white passing people who are trying to claim they are ethnic for being 1/8 ethnic. Not about someone who's double minority mixed. 

The name thing I'm less concerned with. Someone has the option of changing their name if they think it will help them in life. At lease there's a way out."
168,"Oh, well, the first part of your comment came across as speaking generally, not specifically about Emilia."

174,"Wait what?! What video was this in? Never heard of this and that's just sad tbh.

Edit: I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcRs7H0IQdE) criticizing him about his daughter (not his son), and has the original video in the description. Holy shit, he legit refers to his daughter as ""it"" and really hates the fact that the baby doesn't seem to have ""the best of both worlds"". Fucking christ, I've yet to watch the original video, but I don't because he doesn't deserve the watch time. Also I bet that he's more disappointed about his son because god forbid the son look like his wife right?"
175,"Everything said in the video was correct but apparently the video description says it's a parody? Is he just another white loser or what. Funny that a parody got brigaded to shit by the snake and laowhys fanbase. I didn't know it was a daughter. I saw that same clip in (now removed) Daniel dumbrills video exposing laowhy and serpentza and thought he said son in the very first bit when he just came out. I didn't notice how he called his baby it that much before, that just makes the whole thing even worse. Serpentza and laowhys children are going to either become alt right or r/hapas posters."
176,"I've been so frustrated with many of my friends and acquaintances recently, all of whom I consider to be good and reasonable people.

I and pretty much all of my asian friends have been objected to a lot more racist behaviour recently. Whenever this topic comes up everyone who isn't asian just brushes it aside with ""Well, you should consider how these people feel, they are just scared"".

It's not that I don't get that people are scared. It's just that so many people can empathise with people who show racist behaviour more easily than with those who are the actual victims of racism. How about *you* and all these other people consider how I and every asian person who considers themselves American/european etc feels? Why is it always us who have to be complaint and understanding?"
177,"I’m not gonna lie, I do feel isolated sometimes whenever the topic of interracial dating gets brought up in Asian American discourse. For one thing, I’m dating an indigenous Mexican Native American man, as opposed to a white guy like so many other Asian women tend to, but also it feels very cis-heteronormative to me. I do recognize the privilege that I have as a feminine bisexual in a straight passing relationship and just being a feminine Asian woman in general that’s somewhat attracted to men sexually and romantically. After all, the Asian identity is often perceived as hyper feminine in western societies and to refuse or be unable to conform to western gender and sexual expectations can be isolating and even deadly. There’s also the issue of helping my partner through his racial issues, much like how he helps me through mine. There’s also the fact that I’ll adopt his generational traumas and marginalizations much like how he’ll get mine by proxy, which is something that I doubt people who are in relationships with white people even think about. On top of that, there’s the whole wmaf hate which I get and ngl interracial relationships between white men and women of color do seem to take up a lot of space in the discussion in general, but that can also be draining and depressing since my bf might also be perceived as just another white guy due to his skin color and racial ambiguity."

I've (27F) been dating someone (27M) for about 3 months now. He's white, I'm Asian. The other night we were hanging out with some of his friends and the following exchange happened between him and this other white guy he didn't know all that well, henceforth known by the garbage emoji. I (along with the other 10ish people in the room) was in full earshot.

🗑️: Oh, that's your girlfriend over there?

🗑️: I have this friend who would absolutely kill for an Asian girlfriend.

I just sat there, frozen in time. The rest of the room went fully silent too. I wish I could have said something but my brain was completely in shock. I felt so awkward the rest of the night until he left. I'm left feeling like a dumbass for not giving him a verbal smackdown, but I don't really know his friends that well and didn't feel comfortable doing that.

184,Thank you for saying this!
185,"Thanks for sharing your experience. It sounds really similar to mine, down to growing up in the Midwest. There were very few Asians where I grew up. (In my recollection, zero in my class.) My parents' English wasn't great, and they were subjected to a lot of racism even though I wasnt really aware of it, but I always had a sense growing up that we were different and had to be careful how we behaved in public and around non-Asians.

My eyes were opened to the racism directed at Asians during the SARS epidemic when my peers and even teachers treated my family and me like we were diseased animals. It was so painful. My parents conscientiously didn't let any of us go anywhere except for essential activities for almost half a year, and I know there was a lot of BS behind the scenes I was not aware of.

Unfortunately I have seen a resurgence of similar racism towards Asians, and even though I've moved I still live in an area of mostly non-Asians where there is anti-Asian sentiment. The most recent thing I heard through the grapevine is an Asian international student getting called a ""virus spreading b*tch"" at a local supermarket. Sigh. Thankfully nothing explicit or violent has happened to me personally, but the recoiling and ugly looks are all back. Some people I considered friends have shown their true faces as well. Stay safe out there everyone."
186,"I'm Australian and had similar experiences during the SARS outbreak, however the racism I grew up with prior to it had never really been mild, anyway."
187,There are a lot of Chinese-based businesses (mainly restaurants and shops) here in Canada that are complaining that other Canadians are showing racism towards them because sales have dropped by 70-80% since the coronavirus surfaced. However what they fail to realize is that their clientele is primarily Asian and it is other Asian people avoiding going out to Asian malls and restaurants. I find that Asian people are so quick to throw the word discrimination around.
188,Probably one of the dumbest defense against discrediting anti-Asian racism I’ve ever seen. Co-opting white supremacist talking points just to kowtow. Could never be me.
189,"I believe you are being downing voted for the latter point about self-discrimination and maybe it came off wrong.

I agree that the fear of catching the disease does create less business traffic to Chinese businesses because we are avoiding crowds. That disease avoiding behaviors have started in the Chinese community is being ignored. Just letting you know I don’t think what you said is all wrong."

195,"So, I grew up in a very white and conservative part of Canada. It wasn’t until I moved to a more diverse city that I realized how subtly racist people were back home. It’s made me a little distrustful of white people in general. Things like people would take me a less seriously. Or people I thought were my friends weren’t as nice to me as they were to their white friends. They’d say things about immigrants which weren’t overtly racist but in hindsight always came from racist mindsets. Have any of you ever gone through something similar?"
196,"I’ve been watching this new Netflix series called Gentified. It’s about a Mexican-American family that’s struggling to keep their family restaurant afloat due to the threat of gentrification pushing them out. What I found interesting was that aside from a female Asian fabric worker, most of the people that are perceived to contribute to gentrification via hyper consumption are white people, with Asians following suit. I do find it interesting about the model minority is perpetuated but also something that does happen in real life as well. Rich or even just well-off Asians contribute to the issue, even indirectly and I wish this was talked about more within Asian diaspora circles. Unfortunately the show is underrated at the moment so I haven’t seen a lot of discussions about the series and especially how others feel about how Asians are shown."

I just avoid the assholes it's not worth my time. Also, there's definitely a difference with how strong your accents are. Mine sounds like I grew up here, but my parents still have accents and there's definitely a difference in how service staff treat us especially in more rural areas."

231,">Diane has long validated both her own sadness and her disinterest in  doing anything about it—something that feels real and true for writers  who struggle with their mental health, as well as for [women who diminish their own lives](https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/bojack-horseman-princess-carolyn-racial-identity) in order to prioritize the happiness of those around them.

&#x200B;

>Despite  her commitment to her own history of trauma (which defines both her  sense of self and her art), her voice is subsumed to the voices  others—literally. She ghostwrites an entire memoir as BoJack; she later  takes a job writing tweets for celebrities in which she, again, is a  ghost of a voice.  
>  
>And instead of fighting for herself, Diane fights for causes. She  decides, seemingly randomly, that she cares about orphans in the  Republic of Cordovia; on live television, she challenges Hank  Hippopopalous (Philip Baker Hall), a beloved actor who has victimized  women throughout his career; she latches onto anti-fracking activism;  she tackles capitalism and confronts a mega-corporation despite the  knowledge that the company can literally kill her if it wants to. (In  the universe of *BoJack Horseman,* Congress approved a bill allowing billionaries to murder people.)  
>  
>But even as she puts social justice before her own needs and  prioritizes the people she cares about, Diane has an air of selfishness.  She doesn’t come across as a person who inspires others to do better;  instead, she appears judgmental and holier-than-thou in theory but in  practice, is not being much better than those she criticizes. She stands  up for survivors, but is also extremely close with BoJack, who has a  long history of being cruel to the women in his life. She wants to fight  capitalism, but she’s spent her adult life surrounded by celebrities  and all that comes with their wealth. She pushes the idea that women  should support women, but she largely considers herself to be better  than other women, judging her coworkers at Girlcroosh (essentially a  BuzzFeed parody) and looking down on young women at the mall. And she  engages with her racial identity in a strange and stilted way, but keeps  it at a distance.

The note that Diane engages with her racial identity ""in a strange and stilted way"" is, I think, partly the fault of the show's decision makers, who didn't hire culturally competent writers until quite late in the show's run -- the creator pretty much admitted that he was initially scared to talk about Diane's Vietnamese American identity and regretted not handling it better:

>For a long time, because we cast a  white actress to play  Diane, I was afraid of this conversation  happening. And because of  that, we really downplayed her race and her  cultural heritage. We’ve  treated her basically like a white woman  because I didn’t want to have a  white woman playing an overtly Asian  character, because that felt  somehow more wrong to me.  
>  
>And  now I feel the opposite. We did a complete disservice to  the character  by making her so white. Obviously what white-coded means  is  subjective, and there are Asian women who relate to Diane and I don’t   want to discount their experiences. But I do think we have avoided   stories that could have been more interesting because of my own fear and   guilt about the casting.  
>  
>And  \[that fear\] has had an additionally problematic effect:  Because I  wasn’t thinking of Diane as an Asian character first, I didn’t  feel the  need to hire Asian writers, and that is a responsibility that I  should  have felt much earlier. So that is something I regret as well.

I spent at least half an hour talking about Okja alone. The PA said, oh is he famous in America? I said oh yeah. The most famous Korean director of the moment! We were passing Bongeunsa temple, and my PA’s last name was Bong too, and I go, wow so many Bongs today! At the end of the day, we’re like, so what do your parents do? He says my mom is a homemaker, my dad is a director. I go, oh? Would I know of his work? (I have no idea why I asked this question bc I hate when people ask it of me! Like how do I know if you know my work?!) There is a slight pause from the driver’s seat and he says, um...a movie called Mother? And...Memories of Murder? When I tell you I screamed. 😂😂😂😂I called him a 배신자, which means betrayer. Hyomin is a talented filmmaker in his own right, and just as generous as his dad. He was my guest at the P.S.

252,"The article focuses on Harley Quinn but it's remarkable how NONE of the female characters come off as objectified despite the fact that most of them are wearing skin-tight or otherwise skimpy clothing. I usually roll my eyes when people (lbr, men) claim that female comic book characters' barely-there costumes are ""empowering"" but in this case it actually works because the costumes are functional and the women aren't posed or shot in ways solely meant to highlight their bodies. Props to Cathy Yan."
253,">In *Birds of Prey* as opposed to *Suicide Squad*,  the camera follows what Harley is doing, not how good her ass looks in  the process. When these two variables are at odds in the earlier film,  the latter consideration consistently wins out. One need look no further \[than\] a scene from a *Suicide Squad* trailer. There’s a moment where  Harley steals a purse from a busted window display. You can barely make  out what the accessory looks like because it’s out of focus. The purse  might be what her character cares about in that moment,  but the shot  cares about the figure she cuts when she bends over in leather booty  shorts. That is what is in focus, front and center. That’s what the film  is saying matters.

The description of the scene from the *Suicide Squad* trailer reminds me of **that** gratuitous scene from *Star Trek Into Darkness*. It felt jarring in the trailer, and it still felt jarring [within the context of the movie](https://youtu.be/w6zGX2qpxzU?t=99). We're told by the exposition that this character, Dr. Carol Marcus, is a Starfleet science officer with a doctorate in advanced physics and a specialty in advanced weaponry -- but really, it seems that [her primary purpose](https://youtu.be/6B22Uy7SBe4?t=126) was to serve as the [thumbnail image for the trailer](https://imgur.com/a/t6IG4qV).

261,"At the start of the article, the writer runs a ""micro experiment"" but I wish they chose to pit a white man vs Asian man as opposed to their original plan (Asian woman vs Asian man). Women in general just get more responses in dating apps. I'd have been curious to see what the difference was accounting for race and not gender. 


Anyway, regardless I do feel bad for Asian guys! I hope things get better for them due to recent improved Hollywood portrayal of Asian men. Shows like Kim's Convenience main male character is great at breaking the stereotype. I hear the actor may star in a Marvel movie soon too! Also, the rise of kpop has really helped alter the perception of Asian men and in general made it more accepting for feminine traits in men (we still have a ways to go though). Although I feel like it kind of adds a weird fetishization of Korean men from koreaboos. 


It also sucks that dating is only easier for Asian women because we're also so fetishized. Half of the people who approach me usually just seem to want to get to know me for the wrong reasons. There's no shortage of guys who are approaching me to fulfill a weird Asian fantasy or have only dated Asian women or carry other weird notions about submissive Asian girls. I feel like dating as a minority woman brings upon other issues. Like sure, our dating pool may seem bigger but how many of those are genuine? For this reason, I usually end up dating fellow Asian guys (plus I find Asian men to be really sexy and cute! Screw what the media says).

Damn, I'm definitely in the minority for Asian women then...

From linked study:

>We use logistic regression to model current involvement of men and women separately and find, with the exception of Filipino men, Asian men are significantly less likely than white men to be currently involved with a romantic partner, even after controlling for a wide array of characteristics.

I wonder why Filipino men are the exception. I grew up mostly around Chinese and Filipino kids and the latter were seen as the ""cool"" Asians."
263,"I totally understand and accept there’s an issue with this.

At the same time, whenever this topic comes up, I can’t help but think, “Ok, but Asian men hypocritically stereotype and exclude black women.” Most of the time, I hear Asian guys complaining specifically about being excluded by white women when they themselves are perpetuating the same kind of prejudices. 

Does anyone else feel the same way?"
264,Not something to lose sleep over tbh.
265,"Agreed. I hate the notion that more responses in dating = better responses. No. Firstly, quantity =/= quality and secondly fetishisation =/= genuine desire."
266,"As for the Filipino thing, maybe it has to do with this section in the article:

>This gender gap in romantic involvement among Asians is, in part, because Asian men are much less likely than Asian women to be in a romantic or marital relationship with a different-race partner, even though Asian men and women appear to express a similar desire to marry outside of their race.

I was curious if Filipinos in general are just more likely to date interracially, both men and women. I found this [site:](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/blackinternationalism/2019/05/09/the-hidden-truth-about-multiracial-marriages-the-filipino-american-experience)

>Drawing from data from the 2000 U.S. census, Filipino-Americans are more likely to marry Whites than other Asians when it comes to husbands and wives.

ETA: [Ah, this site has better data comparing interracial marriages.](http://www.asian-nation.org/interracial.shtml#sthash.GRLoEVAg.dpbs) And it looks like Japanese-American men are actually the most likely to marry another race in general, but Filipino- and Korean-American men are the most likely to marry another race when both are US-raised. So back to the drawing board with my theory."
267,"I mean that part is a two way street. Black women do the same to Asian men too. IIRC there’s data to back that up as well. Tbh from what I’ve seen, outside of certain incel communities, the grievance Asian men have is with Asian women excluding them and stereotyping them. It’s like a family member talking shit about you to a stranger, so I can see where the hurt is coming from. I also think people are all hypocritical in their own ways. Like Asian women complaining about yellow fever from white creeps but only chooses to date whites. It’s an all around shit show with everyone being defensive when you call them out on their prejudices"

That’s the problem. Just like tai chi, there’s the soft, meditative discipline, and the actual combat discipline, and the two are pretty separate schools with the meditative version being more popular.

304,"My grandpa practiced Judo, my uncle is an Aikido black belt and former instructor (hard style), and I have two cousins who compete in Karate. So people in my family were always involved and my dad signed me up for Judo classes with him when I was 9. 

I did Judo until I was 13 and then switched to Shōtōkan karate and practiced that until I was 17. But in the end, I doubted my ability to have the conviction to deal a finishing blow in the moment, and a lot of Karate sequences relied on you being able to do that. Plus, I was wondering how much training it would take before my technique was perfect enough to make me (a 5ft 100lb woman) able to defend myself against someone possibly 3x my size.

So I talked to my uncle about Aikido and really liked how it was purely defensive and relied on manipulating the person’s own body weight against them. I tried it out after college at age 23 and have loved it ever since.

What about you? How did you find BJJ?"
305,"That's so cool your family is into martial arts. If I ever have kids I would like to teach them as well. I would love to try shotokan, some of the movements look so pretty. 

Personally I'm much more of a strike first and strike hard kind of person haha :P I'm like 5'7 and 150lbs though so different strokes for different folks. BJJ I like a lot because the better you get the better equalizer it is against big people, I've lost to people much smaller than me just because they're more skilled.

I found BJJ just by researching a lot and walking into different schools until I found one I liked. I'm glad I did; the great thing about all martial arts is you always take that knowledge with you -- your skill and hard work can never be taken away from you. Good luck on your martial arts journey!!"
306,"There’s an emerging trend where people are assumed to not be part of particular groups (unless they make it known) that’s creating an ‘expectation to disclose’ if they don’t want to be accused of exploiting or taking away opportunities. I’m thinking of a debacle where a writer’s depiction of sexual assault was called inaccurate and she felt pressured to disclose that she was a survivor; another recent controversy saw a trans woman writer who wrote a deconstructions of the ‘attack helicopter’ joke (and had not previously disclosed being trans) face rampant speculation she was either an exploitative cis woman or a cis man pretending to be a trans woman.

Nobody should have to reveal these things if they don’t otherwise want to do so. The thing is, these situations follow from a reasonable expectation that the lived experiences of marginalized people are best represented by those people. I’m not really sure how it can be fixed — apart from not making assumptions about things like sexuality, trans status, survivor status etc."
