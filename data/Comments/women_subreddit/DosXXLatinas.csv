7,Hi I completely agree with you on it being on both sides. The reason I chose female only is because I am replicating a previous study which was geared towards female particularly. I will definitely consider including all genders on my next project :)

Looking back, I'm realized how much of a stupid, ignorant fool I was for believing in that shit. Hell, many ""Hispanic"" people still hold that belief (from what I have encountered irl and online). Some of them have say the most disgusting machista stuff I have ever heard in my life. Thankfully, my family is not like that.

Actually, you're allowed to come in and post/comment your thoughts anytime you want. ""*Latina""* isn't a race, and there are plenty of Afro-""*Latinxs*"" out there: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L8OZIMDEcc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L8OZIMDEcc)

>I generally don't view any ethnic minority sub as self help services

While I agree with outsiders posting Q&A's, I have the opposite view about ""self-help"". My belief is that members of an ethnic/racial/religious/gender community SHOULD help each other out and offer advice. If you hold the opposite beliefs, then I respect that fully.

>Your willingness to evolve and learn is awesome. I don't want to downplay that. I lurk r/asklatinamerica and many of them don't even think racism exists in their nations. It is crazy to me when I see users with the DR flag by their name saying this.

Thank you for your kind words. And yes, what you have described going on with r/asklatinamerica is problematic. That is why I have been posting and commenting less on that sub for a while now.

21,I see a lot of focus on Mexican Americans there. I think a lot of  Hispanics are racist. I'm Cuban American and I will tell you what these viejos are racist AF and are pro-Trump. Sometimes the oppressed become the oppressors.
22,"Yes, all history should be remembered - even if it's not flattering. It's still relevant today.

It's my blog by the way. Lot's of people wonder what ""Latinos"" were doing or saying in the civil rights era. The blog is an attempt to answer those questions in their own words - with direct quotes from the largest latin american organizations at the time."
23,"Assimilation and Xenophobia are complicated, we all know this history, like earlier there is no reason to target Mexicans here unless you are making a real gesture. I sure hope this is not the intent of this sub, we get enough of this from gringos."
24,I'm pretty sure most latinx already realize this. We know the past must be remember to do better in the future.
25,More stories with Cuban Americans and Puerto Ricans are coming soon - and opinions on issues other than race.
26,"I'm the one who linked your blog, I thought that this history should be remembered by everyone (especially those in the African-American and ""Latino"" communities). If I may ask, are you a black male?"
27,"Most people today do NOT know this. They are not teaching this history in any schools. Even people who are promoting ""Latino"" history don't tell these stories. 

Most people don't even know that there wasn't such a thing as a ""hispanic""/""latino"" minority group untill the 80s. Nearly all Latin Americans were historically considered white."
28,"\>  If I may ask, are you a black male?

Yes. I'm of black American and Dominican heritage. I was born a ""hispanic"" though."
29,"I have had many conversations about this history with other latinos, its the gringos who don't know it.

Also the invention of a word does not create a people. ""African american"" became a mainstream term quite recently, but the descendants of slaves living in the US existed long before modern times. It is the same with hispanic and latino. We have all had a cultural connection for a very long time and been part of the same community."
30,"> African american"" became a mainstream term quite recently, but the descendants of slaves living in the US existed long before modern times. It is the same with hispanic and latino. We have all had a cultural connection for a very long time and been part of the same comm


That's not an equal comparison. ""African American"" was just a semantic difference -a new term for the same concept. There was always a concept that people of African descent were a racial minority group, just the term used changed. ""Negro"", ""Colored"", ""Black"", and ""African-American"" were just different terms.

When ""hispanic"" was introduced in the 1980s, it wasn't just a term. It was new concept entirely. There was no notion before then that all Latin Americans were somehow part of the same community, nor that they were minorities. Historically, Mexicans, Cubans and Puerto Ricans were distinct nationality groups that were not related, never saw themselves collectively, and they were NOT minorities. Most people of Spanish or Latin-American origin had always been considered white - and they identified as white.

The introduction of the ""hispanic"" classification artificially invented that Spanish-Speakers are minorities, creating a minority group that did not exist before then. There was no idea of that. Imagine if someone arbitrarily invented tomorrow that all people of German or German-speaking origin were minorities and called them ""germanics"". The ""hispanic"" group was that contrived when it was created. No one understood it. It took about 15-20 years to normalize the concept of a ""hispanic"" minority group."
31,">I have had many conversations about this history with other latinos, its the gringos who don't know it.

Most young ""latinos"" have no clue about this. They think the ""latino"" minority group has always existed for 500 years - when just 40 years ago, no one would have known what a ""hispanic"" or a ""latino"" was. Millenials are actually the first generation that was born ""hispanic"".

It's older generations, baby boomers, who remember when there was no ""hispanic"" concept."
32,"Actually, the term has been in use since the 3rd century BC, it is latin in origin and refered to spainish speaking colonies of rome. Your assertion that it was invented in the 80s is false. Additionally, people from the caribbean, central and south america were not treated equally to whites who were descendants of the established settlers, and thirdly people from spainish speaking places abdolutely did see themselves as part of the same community. Read books from 1920s and watch movies and tv shows from the 50s, talk to your parents and grandparents. I was alive in the 80s and people then gathered together in community to support each other. This has been happening for over 400 years. You want to discuss history how about actually learning it first."
33,"Again, the invention of a name does not mark the start of a group of people. This is not difficult to comprehend unless you are totally illiterate."
34,">Your assertion that it was invented in the 80s is false.

There was never a ""hispanic"" ethnic category before the 1980s. [Here's a piece on the woman who coined the term ""hispanic"" in the 70s.](https://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Meet-the-woman-who-coined-Hispanic-in-1737623.php)

>Additionally, people from the caribbean, central and south america were not treated equally to whites who were descendants

Latin Americans that were white were historically considered white in the United States and not distinguished from European nationality groups. They were not minorities. The ""hispanic"" term redefined them as non-white minorities artificially.

>thirdly people from spainish speaking places abdolutely did see themselves as part of the same community.

No they did not. There was really no concept of that. In the 50s, Cubans and Mexicans had absolutely nothing to do with each other. They were never part of the same ethnic group.

>Read books from 1920s and watch movies and tv shows from the 50s, talk to your parents and grandparents.

I have extensively. Every post on the blog is a quote from an academic book. There was no notion of ""hispanic/latino"" in those decades. Elderly ""hispanics"" are usually very honest about this. Some people say it was the 90s before they ever heard the term ""hispanic"" or understood that concept.

>You want to discuss history how about actually learning it first.

This is the reason I started the blog. A lot of people, such as yourself, are sadly ignorant of this history. The ""Latino"" group has genesis amnesia."
35,"There was no concept that Spanish-Speakers were an ethnic group before the ""hispanic"" category was created. That's not an idea that existed.

Cubans, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans had never thought of themselves collectively before then. They used to be distinct ethnic groups that were not related.

&#x200B;

>This is not difficult to comprehend unless you are totally illiterate.

Maybe you are the one that is illiterate. There was never a concept before the introduction of the ""hispanic"" category, that all people who Speak Spanish were part of the same ethnic group, nor that they were minorities. Latin Americans used to be different nationality groups that did not identify with each other nor were they perceived as part of the same community. And they were categorized as one of the normal races - most of them were considered white. There was no notion that a Spanish-Speaker was a minority.

When ""hispanic"" was introduced, it wasn't just a new term. It redefined distinct nationality groups as one community, and artificially made all of them into non-white minorities. That's not a *concept* that existed before then. ""Hispanic"" was considered ridiculous when it started to be used - especially by Latin-Americans themselves. Much has been written about this. I'd recommend [a recent book written by sociologist Cristina Mora, called ""Making Hispanics""](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Hispanics-Activists-Bureaucrats-Constructed/dp/022603383X), that details how this concept was politically fabricated."
36,"Every since the people in central and south america fought for Independence from spain they have had the concept of a pan-american people. It was written about even back in the late 1800's. People from one country would help in independence fights in other countries. So yes, actually there has been the idea that people belong to a similar group for a very long time. They just used different terminology."
37,"I think a lot of Latin-American people don't see themselves as POC, for example my parents see themselves as white despite the fact we're immigrants and we're clearly not european-white.  And because they don't see themselves as POC they don't feel solidarity towards other races and other immigrants.

Also latinamericans are very religious and mostly conservative. So yeah I think is a big problem in the Latin-American community, both in Latin-American countries and in the diaspora communities. :/"
38,"Greed and ambition are qualities that anyone of any color can have. And in this country, skin color can be a currency. Andy Ngo spends his to add credibility to his views, when otherwise he wouldn't have any. Candace Owens does the same. 

As a people, we shouldn't be selling out our skin color to promote ideas that we don't agree with. But as individual, many of us do. 

Candace Owens gets views because she understands that being a vocal conservative of *color* is a niche that not many are willing to fill. 

I think that there are some who are true believers, but it's pretty rare i think. 

I was at a protest during a Trump rally in WA state in Everette before the 2016 election, an there were more people of color in that rally than I could imagine.

Yep, I agree with you on this statement."
41,">example my parents see themselves as white 

That is so interesting to me as black woman. So do they also see themselves on equal social status to whites? (in the US) thanks."
42,">I'm mexican and all I could do was to shout GTFO of that line. ""but he only wants to deport the bad ones"" is the response i got. It left a bad taste in my mouth.

I'm not Latinx (I'm Black and the OP from the original post lol) and I'm not an immigrant, but I can't stand that line of reasoning.

I live in an area where most people are Asian immigrants and I'm always baffled by the amount of conservatives here, but I was especially surprised a while ago when I really started to notice the more recent wave of immigrant/refugee panic seeping from America and into our politics (I'm from Canada). I couldn't believe some of the shit I was hearing my *immigrant* neighbors saying, but what really fucked me was when I saw people on the news protesting! POCs out here protesting in the name of racism and xenophobia. These people are immigrants themselves chanting in accented English about how bad refugees are. 

People act like they'll be safe because they had the money and privilege to be able to come here at their leisure instead of having to flee conflict or harsh conditions. They act like some racist asshole is going to know or care about the difference between the two when they're yelling at them to go back to their country. But the individual problems aren't even the biggest issue. Systematically, you always target the weakest members of a group first. Dehumanize refugees so that society gets used to associating POC with subhumanity. Then, violence and discrimination against less-vulnerable members (like """"""the good/legal immigrants"""""") becomes easier.

Sorry to rant, but ""he only wants to deport the bad ones"" really sets me off. lol I've heard it before and it gets dumber every time."
43,">I was at a protest during a Trump rally in WA state in Everette before the 2016 election, an there were more people of color in that rally than I could imagine.

I'm curious, but were the PoC in the Trump rally mostly ""Hispanic"" and Asian right?"
44,">and I have family that voted for Trump because they're so Catholic that they'll vote for anyone they think will ban abortion.

If I may ask you: What do they think of his racism and have you tried to change their minds?"
45,"We're in Canada, but yes they do. Of course they have felt discrimination when finding a job, but they feel it's because we're newcomers who have a strong accent ,not because we're POC.

Also we all immigrated as adults, my parents were 50+ when we migrated, so they've always lived a life were they've been seen as white (as I have, in my country I look like almost everyone lol). Now they feel as immigrants, but they don't feel like POC."
46,">I'm curious, but were the PoC in the Trump rally mostly ""Hispanic"" and Asian right?

Actually no, it was mostly hispanic and black. There wasn't a lot of them, it was still few and far between. But I didn't expect to see ANY of them in the line. 

And the city is predominantly white and 15% hispanic. So i dont know how much of a factor that was, or how much of it was me subconsciously taking extra notice at any hispanic people i saw."
47,"I only see them once a year, so I actually don’t know! I would imagine that they would say the ends justify the means."
48,"Tbh, I'm actually not surprised anymore to see ""Hispanics"" supporting Fuckface Von Clownstick and what he stands for. I crossposted on this sub before about internalized racism and how common it is in the ""Latinx"" community."
49,">I'm actually not surprised anymore to see ""Hispanics"" supporting Fuckface Von Clownstick

Well, hispanic people largely oppose Fuckface Von Clownstick. There are some that do, but I don't think it's more prevalent with hispanics than other group of minorities. Cubans I think are the exception, since a lot of their specific community vote republican. 

But that's also not to say that internalized racism isn't also found in my own mexican community. Machismo and racism is something that we work to combat, and it's a personal drive of mine to root it out. My mexican friends and close family combat those issues."
50,">Cubans I think are the exception, since a lot of their specific community vote republican.

The majority of Cubans in America are full-blooded Spaniards or quadroons (3/4 white,1/4 black), different from ""Hispanics"" who come from Mexico and Central America.

>Machismo and racism is something that we work to combat, and it's a personal drive of mine to root it out. My mexican friends and close family combat those issues.

That's great. Me and my family also share the same beliefs as you."
51,"> The majority of Cubans in America are full-blooded Spaniards or quadroons (3/4 white,1/4 black), different from ""Hispanics"" who come from Mexico and Central America.

It has less to do with genetic make up than the history of american-cuban relations. A lot of republicans were hardline hawks when it came to castro. And as many cubans fled cuba, they largely agreed with the republicans on this issue. Which was their top issue for the overwhelming majority of cubans. It solidified their support for the republican party. But this trend is changing and cubans are as supportive of the republican party as they once were."
52,"It's pretty common. It's based on white supremacy and the casta system. My abuela was like this, too."
53,"I feel like this is kind of in line with this bizarre interaction I had with my mom recently. I'm Cuban and very white. In most places I entirely pass until people hear my last name. The same is true for my family. They all look white except when they're standing next to white people.

&#x200B;

Anyway, my brother and his wife (half Filipino) just had a baby, and, playfully, I said ""Oh a cute little brown baby"". So the response from the rest of my family was focusing on how the baby's only ""a quarter Filipino"". I was, and still am, confused by how they could completely neglect where we(my immediate family) sit in American culture.

54,"My parents and extended family couldn't have cared less about who I fell in love with, but since I was in schools with white majorities, unfortunately I grew up with the notion that ""white is better"" and also a preference for white girls. Thankfully, I grew out of that stage a while ago."

An explanation for this sub would be that it is a space for ""Latinas"" and the issues/topics they would like to discuss pertaining to them.

86,She's chicana and I love her :D
87,"No, sorry. "
88,you history is questionable .-.
89,"Huh... When I was in high school (late 90s, early 2000s), you would see it, not incredibly common, but definitely a thing.

I don't remember the last time I saw it in Puerto Rico. Didn't see it when I lived in Mexico either.

Then again, I'm older"
90,"Nah hell no, it's trashy as shit.  Girls did it to appear ""popular"" before, but outside of the usa (I'm in australia)  It's a huuuuge faux-pas"

94,"I have mixed feelings. It just shows how hard it is to be a ""good"" woman. But I like the last two and I think they're solid advice. "
95,Seria bueno tradicir esto para poner en r/TrollXChromosomes. 
96,Uy. Ni a la mitad alcanze a llegar. Las primeras dos eran un poco dudosas pero llegue a la tercera y ya para que seguir leyendo. 
97,The republican party doesn't deserve love. They've historically supported violent regimes in latinamerica that have costed hundreds of thousands of lives. Every republican president in my view deserves to be lined up and shot. Excuse me if I'm breaking sub rules with no hatred but I won't mince words for an organization that supported a regime that targeted my family.
98,"I grew up in central LA in the 1980s when cholas were at peak popularity, at least style wise, so my opinion may be biased. Personally I think it is problematic because the look is directly related to gangs and poverty. It makes me think of the low income, disenfranchised, young women from the barrio with moms that work cleaning houses or sewing in one of the downtown clothing factories, and dads that work two jobs so they never see him, or he's been deported and isn't at home.... I think of girls pregnant at 15 because their moms are too overwhelmed with poverty or too embarrassed to talk about birth control with them. When I think of cholas I think of girls who lack involved parents and who get involved with older cholos as a status symbol because they have daddy issues. Cholas make me think of gangbang initiations, or girl on girl violence. I asked a chola once when I was little why she looked like she did and she told me you have to be the meanest, ugliest bitch to survive the streets.... But things have changed since the 80s so I'm sure it's all good now and cholas represent some kind of hood girl power. I still think it's one of the ugliest aesthetics out there. My 2 centavos."
99,"When I was younger I lived and breathed being a cholo. Three flowers in my hair, creased up ben davis, creased white t-shirt, chain hanging low from my belt loop to my wallet... you get the picture. I was no angel. Lived the life almost to the fullest. Seen a lot of my friends get locked up or 6 feet under. During my early 20's I woke up and decided enough was enough. I decided to give back to the community and helped the younger generation not follow our footsteps. I stopped everything all together by late 90's. I started to dress different. Changed my cholo grammer and accent with a lot of practice. Now a days I cringe when I see younger generations dress like that that don't know anything about that life. Halloween are especially hard when I see younger adults dress like cholos and cholas for fun. I seen a lot of violence from eachother as well as from law enforcement because we looked the part. A part of me sees the style attractive but a bigger part sees it as a representative of a lot of violence. Please excuse the grammer and misspellings. "
100,"I dislike more the attitude/culture than the fashion.

Being unneddedly noisy and not even trying to learn how to speak properly is badly seen at every culture.

I am a metalhead, I have long hair and wear concert tshirts very often. I walk straight, speak properly and always make sure to say 'please' and 'thank you' when I interact with other people. I even practiced smiles and handshakes too. Ohh and my gf makes sure I never wear the same tshirt twice in a row and I don't smell like hobo.

So even if I dress like an slob and I am as ugly as taxes people treat me decently because I treat them the same. What are the odds?

I have also meet all those ""missunderstood"" metalheads who always carry 'bad attitude' and do nothing productive everyday while wearing pot-scented tshirts. Those are the ones who get 'discriminated'.

The metalhead community looks down on people like that after a certain age.

Sadly the cholo community do encourage said behavior at every age and even parents teach it to their kids with things like ""el que no tranza no avanza"" or ""mejor que se chingen los demás que yo"" or simply by example.

A person like that is unemployable."
101,"I took my daughter who is 18 years old to the movies last week. At El Paseo in South Gate. I was buying our tickets when a young girl, maybe 15 or 16 caught my eye. she was wearing a cropped wife beater, super starched baggy dickies, that ""belt"" with the initial as the buckle, black and white Nike Cortez sneakers, her hair was no that long but was uber straight, parted in the middle, large hoop earings, no fake nails...no big make up. She was quite pretty, just really dark lip color and the signature sharpie eyebrows. When I took in her style, I was transported to 1984, junior high school. My mouth said...""what the fuck..."" my daughter not having missed a beat, looked where I was staring...I grew up in this era of cholos, cholas, killing each other at schools, for a street name. Some kids are born into this style I get it, it's unavoidable...but having a sibling who was more in prison that out, HE even thinks this it's bad news that it's become a ""style or trend"" now. Kids used to get beat up and killed just because they looked like a cholo or chola. This kid I was gawking at, she couldn't possibly fathom what her clothing meant. She didn't even speak English. So it's a trend. And it's coming back and the scary part is that kids don't know what the fuck they are bringing back with it. "
102,"I've never really liked it. I don't like the eyebrows and I hate the flashy nails. 
As for the gang culture of it, people don't join gangs for the fashion of it. "
103,"I agree with you. The eyebrows in particular are what make me dislike the style, but I always saw it as kind of harmless because I don't think anyone will join a gang just because of liking the way they look. I could be wrong,  but I don't know."
104,"I wish I wasn't so late to this, but how can individuals help make the situation better? I want to know what someone can do on an individual scale to make this injustice right. "
