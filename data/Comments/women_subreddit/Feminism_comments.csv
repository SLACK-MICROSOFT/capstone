For god's sake, Biden made his position very clear with the constant on-camera touching and the whole Anita Hill incident."

4,"Chinmayi for those who don't know was a prolific singer in the Indian film industry. She spoke up during the rise of the me too movement about her own experience getting harassed by a famous songwriter (who is considered one of the greatest minds in tamil literature and has written several books of poetry and novels about life in rural Tamilnadu, focusing on lives of women). The song writer has tremendous clout in the film industry and she had essentially been pushed into obscurity and faces a lot of online harassment. She still speaks up."
5,"Here is the entire passage for those who want to read it in context. But it should also be noted that Neruda did not win the Nobel prize for writing his memoirs,--in fact his memoirs were published after he won the Nobel prize--he was awarded the prize for his poetry.

I'm not defending him; I'm just stating facts. Here is the passage. Read it for yourself. The quotation in question is at the end of this passage.

""My solitary bungalow was far from any urban development.  When I rented it, I tried to find out where the toilet was; I couldn’t  see it anywhere. Actually, it was nowhere near the shower, it was at  the back of the house. I inspected it with curiosity. It was a  wooden box with a hole in the middle, very much like the artifact  I had known as a child in the Chilean countryside. But our toilets  were set over a deep well or over running water. Here the receptacle was a simple metal pail under the round hole.The pail was clean every morning, but I had no idea how its contents disappeared.   
One morning I rose earlier than usual, and I  was amazed when I saw what had been happening.   Into the back of the house, walking like a dusky statue, came  the most beautiful woman I had yet seen in Ceylon, a Tamil of the pariah caste. She was wearing a red-and-gold sari of the cheapest kind of cloth. She had heavy bangles on her bare ankles. Two tiny red dots glittered on either side of her nose. They must  have been ordinary glass, but on her they were rubies.     
She walked solemnly toward the latrine, without so much as a  side glance at me, not bothering to acknowledge my existence, and vanished with the disgusting receptacle on her head, moving  away with the steps of a goddess.She was so lovely that, regardless of her humble job, I couldn’t  get her off my mind. Like a shy jungle animal she belonged to  another kind of existence, a different world. I called to her, but it  was no use. After that, I sometimes put a gift in her path, a piece  of silk or some fruit. She would go past without hearing or looking. That ignoble routine had been transformed by her dark  beauty into the dutiful ceremony of an indifferent queen.  
**One morning, I decided to go all the way. I got a strong grip on her wrist and stared into her eyes. There was no language I  could talk with her. Unsmiling, she let herself be led away and was soon naked in my bed.** Her waist, so very slim, her full hips, the brimming cups of her breasts made her like one of the thousand-year-old sculptures from the south of India. It was the coming together of a man and a statue. **She kept her eyes wide open all the while, completely unresponsive. She was right to despise me.** The experience was never repeated."""
6,Oh shit. I really love his poems. Feel so disappointed.
7,"He also had a daughter that he despised and abandoned. The girl had hydrocephalia and Neruda referred to her as ""pig"" and ""vampire"".  
Sorry for bad english"
8,This makes me so sad. I loved pablo neruda poetry
9,"""i know I'm a selfish shithead, but no one will stop me lol"""
10,">Unsmiling, she let herself be led away and was soon naked in my bed.

That sentence. Hoooly, ""she let herself be led away"". It makes me angry as if she consented to the rape with this action."
11,Thanks for the passage.
12,"He's fucking disgusting. Its such a men writing women thing too ""Oh yeah, I raped this woman but lets play it down by some year 9 poetry hmmm?"""

14,"For now, one in every 4 circuit judges have been [placed](https://www.voteinorout.com/u/@riseandroar/research/by9XMQD) by the Trump Administration, all under the age of 50. Also while this is going on, [39 Republican senators and 168 reps](https://www.voteinorout.com/u/@riseandroar/research/zr1d0yM) signed an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to overturn Roe V Wade. Keep track of what they're doing with this, and with pollution."

17,"What does them being feminists have to do with it?

Kind of feels like you wanted to vent about girls and young women wearing revealing clothing on social media and that they supposedly have ""feminist"" texts over their images was an afterthought to make the post fit the sub.

Unless I'm missing something, in which case I'd be grateful if you could explain why it's particularly the young feminists among them that bother you."
18,"     I agree completely, sadly I think society has (and is) raised these girls this way, in the sense of that they aren’t valuable to society if they aren’t showing themselves as sexually appealing. Many social medias that I know, the people with the most views are people from both sexes who show themselves as sexually appealing as possible. Often they are underage, and are growing up thinking these things which makes me sad. 
     I can personally relate also, because when I was in 7th & 8th grade (I am young myself, I am an almost 16 year old male), a lot of girls were starting to wear a lot more revealing clothes and trying to appeal more to boys. I absolutely hate to have to use this word but it is the only word I find that can describe them, “thots”, not because of its definition no, but it basically had (and still has) a connotation put on by society. It basically means a girl that dresses and acts more inappropriately, and acts extremely defensively when described as a “thot” although that is exactly how they are acting as.
     Now I know that I can’t speak for them, because I don’t know what they’re going through or how they find joy in expressing themselves in these ways. I sometimes think that they are almost hypocritical, the way how they act as “thots” but voice themselves as feminists when speaking to them or on social media, but realize that this is the way society has raised them. I can for sure say that society and social media has a profound effect on the way I act, think, and speak, but is not limited to literally what I wear for the purpose of fitting in to people of my age."
19,I ment to say that it worries me deeply that young girls are being taught to stand up and speak out for themselves this way. Like the discussion about JLo and the superbowl performance. Young feminists don't bother me at all but I feel like a lot of young girls are expressing themselves in a way that doesn't come from themselves but from what society tells them is the way to express themselves.

27,"This is so important, at the moment it's looking as if the US presidential election is going to be a head to head between two credibly accused rapists that refuse to even acknowledge the accusations.

The attitude towards Tara Reade from people in other political subs is frankly disgusting. From accusing her of profiteering, to being a Russian asset, or just having a bone to pick with a former boss, time after time women have been subjected to these sexist and bigoted accusations.

The only difference is that now this is coming from the same people that claimed support for Dr Ford, Weinstein's victims, and the teenagers Roy Moore preyed upon."

36,Yes
37,"The police wouldn't take my report because it would ""ruin his life"". What about my life? the injuries he gave me cause pain to this day.   


I hate cops"
38,"YES! I hate when people say shit like 'don't say anything because you'll ruin his life'. Like it's better that your life is ruined than his. He made the choice to ruin his own life when he did what he did. 

I don't know who needs to hear this, but you are important. Whatever happened to you isn't your fault. It's not your fault if their lives are ruined. If you can make the report, make it.

39,"It shouldnt need to be said but they should also tell this to judges, who give perpetrators light sentences so they don't ""Ruin their futures"""

45,"I believe most women on numerous reports of harassment, inequality, bullying, stalking, assault, etc....but here's the problem:

Society still doesn't care. 

That doesn't make it right but too many incompetent people are still in powerful positions. 

I'm not going to list every injustice done to me but I can tell you that speaking up makes you brave...(and that's fantastic)...but bravery doesn't pay the bills and brave doesn't protect you.

Look at that victim of Matt Lauer's. Does anyone give a shit about her career or her hopes and dreams? Nope. 
How about those actresses like Ashley Judd who can't get gigs anymore? 
Does anyone want to know about my dead stepdaughter who turned to drugs to cope with being assaulted by a guy? 

For every woman who speaks up there's somebody covering for some guy. A friend, family, police, employees.

No, it's not ok but it's the world in which we live. 
I still want women to fight the gaslighting and speak up, but we must understand why some say ""Why Bother?""

It's not okay, but sometimes that is the sad reality of male power over women."
46,"Exactly! People go around babbling ""Don't do that, don't report them, their reputation will be ruined!""

53,Don't do anything you wouldn't want those around you finding out about. That shouldn't have to be the reason one doesn't assault another but that's the kind of world we live in. If you do something like that you deserve to have everyone know what you did.
54,People be saying stuff like this and then going out and voting for Biden.
55,Such bullshit. I’m sorry.
56,"I'm so sorry. The police sat with me trying to trip me up for 2 hours and when they realized I wasn't lying and they couldn't shake me because I was telling the truth, they said ""well....I mean...he moved away so just focus on you now""
His shitty current wife protected him. His ex-wife said '""Duh, lady, why do you think I divorced him?"" 

A man who savagely beat me and raped me in front of a witness in the 90s (witness testified to a Grand Jury) plea bargained for 4 years. He was let out of jail in 7 mos. It wasn't ok.

Please know I understand your need for justice. The unfairness can turn a person bitter for valid reasons. You will never be the things that happen TO YOU. I hope you can find peace and heal. 
I probably never will find 100% closure, but I fight to not let it define me."
57,"Same. They asked me “Why are you trying to get him in trouble?” Fuck offffff 

They separated us to question us, and I could hear them talking to my ex through the screen door. My ex was cool as a cucumber, and they were talking about “Did you see the game last night???” Fucking basketball! And then the cop laughs and says “Women, am I right?”

Vote them out! Please vote them out and participate in local elections. I lived in a district where the judge only allowed 5 or 6 orders of protection per month despite hundreds of women asking for help. It was sick."

61,I got banned from r/neoliberal for just saying “I believe Tara Reade”
62,It's deeply disturbing how the media won't report on this.

64,Apparently it’s too much to ask that the president not be a rapist
65,"This was in the 90's too so yeah, I was covered in bruises and even have his hand shaed bruise on my upper arm they could have matched to him and I thought the cops would take me to the station and photograph the bruises but they just patronized and laughed at me and talked down to me and ... fuck them.

The guy is a family lawyer now, isn't that terrifying"
66,"Yeah those guys looked like they would do that

I was covered in bruises and shaking and they were laughing"
67,Wow I had no idea that order of protection thing was an issue. I wonder if people starting requesting percentages from individual judges what the statistics would look like.

77,"I have absolutely no reason idea why they segregate cycling, everyone should complete together

And screw the Tour De France, I am a better cyclist just going to the shops than them because I did it drug free"
78,"They didn’t start the races far enough apart. The cyclist they are talking about immediately made an aggressive breakaway and caught the men, which would be an unfair advantage because she could then draft off of the men’s pack and have a massive advantage. They stopped the whole women’s race and still gave the woman the advantage she had gained. It’s mostly just really poor race planning that negatively effected the women’s race."
79,I'm just going to be blunt. They want a fair league. Same reason for many other leagues.
80,"The problem with combining men with women in athletics is that you further encourage women to dope harder with stuff like testosterone which will cause permanent/irreversible changes to the female body, and the olympics, cycling especially, will never be drug free unfortunately."
81,"I see, ty, yeah that was really poor planning"
82,"That is a problem with competitive sports, not with integrating them."
83,"Yep, I thought we were talking about competitive cycling, my bad."
84,"Yes, it’s very hard to get away from the default being male. God is considered to be male in popular religions. If you imagine a caveman or the chart of human evolution, it’s usually male. It effects the way men see the world since we inherently treat ourselves as the “default” person. I once had a friend (another white man) tell me “I can’t imagine needing to feel represented in media.” Like yeah duh, I bet you can’t imagine that.

The “solution” is just more representation and way more support for female creatives. Having a female president, or many, would help. But really the vast majority of men are so far away from being receptive or even understanding the issue at hand that I think we’re many, many years away from anything even resembling equality. I wish I could live in the nearly genderless future with flying autonomous cars and cleaner air and hopefully the planet isn’t on fire, but unfortunately we live in this time and have to keep pushing for incremental change."
85,"I see what you mean. I can't understand exactly what you deal with, but you aren't a bad person for complaining about it. If it helps, whenever I am told that something amazing was accomplished by a woman I think, ""Huh, that's cool"" and then forget about it, just like everything else they tought me in school. I see it the same way as saying that a person accomplished something. Whether they are male or female, I just think ""good for you!"" And move on. The younger generation is being taught that there is no difference. Soon, all those ""he""s that you see arbitrarily placed will become ""one"" or ""they."" Anyway, hope this helped."
86,"I pretty much agree but would like to point out that using a masculine pronoun as default is grammaticality correct. On one hand shun them for poor feminism, while on the other praise them for proper grammar"
87,[removed]
88,">God is considered to be male in popular religions

In Christianity God created man, and then took a rib from man to create woman, who is named in relation to her derivation from man. From beginning to end, the Christian Bible is extremely disempowering for women and misogynistic. It's a wonder that women subscribe to such religions as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, whose texts are all filled with misogynistic crap."
89,"Not really. Traditionally, perhaps, but the use of female as default is common and valid. 

For example, a lot of writing these days have used female as default when using generic pronouns. Use of the generic ""he"" has been decreasing since the 1970s."
90,Is there any research on why women have a 19.5% higher risk of leaving? Seems like a really interesting piece of data!
91,"Anyone have a link to the original study? I'd be interested to see what ""controlled for"" means in this case and would be willing to bet that a substantial fraction of that percentage is not completely abandoning the job market, but rather switching to the private sector because of the dismally perceived prospects and earning potential in academia."
92,[removed]
93,"I can’t speak for anyone other than myself but I left because I was the only woman in my group and got sick of how I was being treated. My supervisor was a huge asshole to me and my advisor tried to control my personal life, but I don’t think they were that way with the men in our group."
94,"One factor is the bad work-life balance in academia. Women often still take the bulk of housecare and childrearing duties. It can be difficult to do that and feel like you need to invest 60-80 hours a week on your job too.

I've also read that when a male and female scientist are partnered and they are faced with the two body problem sometimes the male partner has been or the only job prospects and the female partner then takes whatever staff or non-academic she can find.

(Both of those have been formally studied I just can't find the article that I read that sites those situations)

I haven't read any articles to quantify the rate at which this happens but I've heard numerous stories from women who were harassed by influential men and it results in the women eventually leaving science. I doubt this is a huge factor specifically in that number but I think it could be an illustration of the many unique reasons why women (or any minority - ethnic, social, gender) might be subtly or forcefully pushed out of the club of academia."
95," I think that's the exact study

98,">I assume much of this is due to biological reasons and the gender inequality that follows (stay at home mom, extra housework). How does a 'sustainable' career help in this (or how does it look, even)?

What do you mean by ""biological reason""? Are you talking about pregnancy and breastfeeding ? 

> do you mean with ""sustainable career"" OP?

1.  Male scientists who are married to other women scientists/in relationships with other female scientists, should be paid/promoted less if they refuse to do child care and house work. 

2.  universities must provide on-campus childcare centers

3. Federal-grant funding & awarding of part-time fellowships and grants to accommodate women with disabilities (both visible and non-visible) & chronic illness, parents and academics with caregiving responsibilities, economically disadvantaged women, LBTQIAPNO+ women.

4.  Midcareer grants for aforementioned people. 

5. Conducting (and disseminating) institutional research on gender equity, bias, scientific sexism -- the idea that women are intellectually inferior. More research should be done on reproductive assistance technologies so that women can avoid the burden of pregnancy (while still managing to get biological children), breastfeeding, menstruation.

6. Supporting conference and meeting grant supplements to cover cost of PI's dependent care travel (with children's and childcare workers' expenses allowable, & with disabilities & chronic illness, minority women)

7. Federal-grant supplements to offset Principal Investigators' productivity losses due to family-related absences, illness, caregiving responsibilities, minority status.

8. Sexual harassment/abuse/assault/rape + holding men into account + do more to attract women of marginalised groups, e.g, disabled women, trans women etc. 

9. Abolishment of scientific elitism -- patent, Nobel, Abell etc., more focus should be put on multi disciplinary sciences and STEM, international collaboration etc.. 

10. There's more but under current circumstances we have to start with these."

100,">Just means that male scientists will choose not to marry or date women scientists. Or choose not to have children at all.

Great! 

It would be a great advantage for women scientists. Unmarried woman scientists fare better.

>You entire post looks like you want to punish those who made sacrifices for their career in order to benefit those who want to have their cake and eat it too. You might say that people shouldnt have to make sacrifices at all and that those who have should be grateful that people no longer have to make those sacrifices. But most of your suggestions are also absurdly expensive and bureaucratic to implement and puts enourmous undue burden on everyone else.


""Let's gaslight/police feminists"" in a nutshell. 

Reported."
101,"Just going to start out and say that developed nations do not have a population problem and actually most and struggling with declining populations. The reason our global population is increasing is developing nations. Without access to health infrastructure child mortality is still very high so people feel the need to have lots of kids. Even where child mortality might be lower many of those communities don't have access to reproductive education and birth control. Or just education and job opportunities for women which lowers the birth rate in those communities.

Second I think you are grossly over estimating the childcare resources currently available. There is a childcare facility at my institution with a 3-4 year waiting list. Not to mention it is too expensive for the egregiously underpaid early career scientists.

But focusing only on baby making as the limit to why women don't choose to stay in academia leaves out a whole lot of women from the discussion. There are many women who can't or choose not to have children that get pushed out too."
102,Hi OP could we please have a summary here of what this video is about and how it relates to Feminism?
103,Marcal discusses how economics have traditionally overlooked female achievement by overvaluing male contributions to it while ignoring things that women do -- all of which make it possible for the economy to function (along with society) in the first place. Really interesting stuff!
104,"Sounds awesome, thank you! :)"
105,You are welcome!
106,"Heya :)

This got me interested so I looked it up. The book I see repeatedly mentioned and well reviewed is this one:

""The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women: Why Capable People Suffer from the Impostor Syndrome and How to Thrive in Spite of It"" by Valerie Young

I have not read it, but it seems promising and Im adding it to my own to read list. It seems well liked on some blogs about feminism and women struggling with mental health issues too so hopefully it's good! :)"
107,Yeah I have seen this one too! I also saw some of Brene Brown and they seem to be well liked too!
108,"I don't think it's wrong to prefer dominance/submission no matter what gender you are. If it happens to align with stereotypical roles, that doesn't make a preference ""bad"".  ""All women secretly like dominant men"" is just one of those dumb redpill myths. The truth is some women do liked being dominated, some don't. No one has to ""work against their natural sexual attraction"" for gender equality to be a thing. 

Even in the famously sexist 40's and 50's, there were men who were quite enamored by femme fatale type women who were powerful, sassy, mouthy and a bit masculine, and were clearly had men wrapped around their little finger. If sweet and obedient is all men want, then Katherine Hepburn, Rita Hayworth, and Lauren Bacall (and lots of other old Hollywood stars) wouldn't have been famous icons with tons of male fans, in a non-PC sexist era."
109,"Check out Jessica Benjamin’s “The Bonds of Love: Psychoanalysis, Feminism, and the Problem of Domination.” Really brilliant analysis of domination and its link to the gendered psyche. Also a very well argued study of erotic sadomasochism in chapter 2, which directly deals with the connection between femininity and passivity and the prevalence of fantasies of submission."
110,Is this a real world version of the Girlie Show!?
111,"It really is time for Americans to dump the failed 2 party system

All it does is breed extremists"
112,"And nothing happened to Kavanaugh. Like so many other important people who are accused of sexual assault and then nothing happens. All of the accusations of sexual misconduct against Trump didn't affect him whatsoever either. 'Grab them by the pussy' became a fucking joke.

People are starting not to care about it. It's not shocking anymore because it is pathetically common among powerful men to also have sexually assaulted someone. And it's pathetically common for them to get away with it. It's like reporting on something ridiculous Trump said. When it happens constantly, it's not news anymore.

I sincerely hope Biden loses the nomination over this, but I doubt it will happen. Powerful men can do whatever they want."
113,"It’s insane, people that believed Kavanaugh’s accuser but are ignoring Biden’s or vice versa are really showing they care more about politics than the women who were hurt because of these men."
114,I don’t doubt Biden’s accuser. It’s super shitty that other dems aren’t speaking up about it. I naively hope the reason it’s not getting more traction is because of the pandemic and our current government’s abysmal handling.
115,"Same reason Republicans decry the ""not my president"" comments when they said it during the Obama administration or why they insisted on impeaching Clinton, yet Trump did no wrong. 

So long as your party or your candidate are the (allegedly) guily party, they get a pass, doesn't matter what was done. You could step out on the front steps of the White House and shoot someone in the face in front of a sea of reporters and so long as you have a majority of the House or Senate, you can walk back inside and continue your day.

Biden gets an extra pass by Democrats because not only is he Democrat, but he's not Bernie Sanders. 

And so long as we're looking at Biden and sexual harassment/assault, don't forget how he handled the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill case."
116,"i mean they’re ignoring his obvious declining mental state and they downplayed the numerous women coming out saying how he made unsolicited and inappropriate personal contact with them. 

they’re going to continue to push the narrative that any opposition to him is russian bots (which i already see in the comments on this post lol), bernie supporters “who are just being mean for not getting behind the consensus candidate” or people trying to get trump elected. i doubt that they will air any reason that he shouldn’t be president for the foreseeable future, which is a real shame because this story is absolutely disgusting and so is he. 

we dont need another lying rapist in the white house, we have on right now and it sucks."
117,"One thing I think is disturbing is also the relative ages. Kavanaugh was like 18 when he ""allegedly"" almost suffocated Prof. Ford in his rape attempt.

124,"The double standard of the Democrats. What an absolute shame.

The Republicans will use this accusation as fuel to claim (and rightly so) that Dems only believe *when it is convenient for them*. Which is exactly what we are doing.

Why do make an outrage when Trump says he will “grab them by the pussy” but when our own nominee, Biden, is accused we overlook it to continue our justified “Trump is a shithead” parade. I get the argument the Tara Reede accusation would headline more, in an alternate universe where coronavirus does not exist. Does not give us the right to be silent, and does not give us the right to keep giving him delegates in the Primary.

129,"It’s insane that so many of the people who don’t believe these women tend to be women themselves, or at least in my experience. Like I just got into an argument with my Mom about this and she didn’t care. 

She said women are completely at fault when not coming out about sexual allegations (because they can always just report it and move on right? They definitely don’t run into road bumps like getting silenced and fired 🙂) and A man penetrating you with his finger is not really sexual assault (this is the woman who once called herself progressive). Also she said if the allegations are true, then why aren’t news outlets talking about it? Funny I was thinking the same thing, it’s almost like they’ve been working their asses off trying to back anyone who isn’t Bernie even if it costs them a Trump re-election. 

Maybe it’s because Biden is the liberal media’s darling because he is a corporate puppet and he supports their class and financial interests. I love her, but she’s brainwashed by the corporate media, it’s official lol Anything they don’t show her doesn’t exist and it frightens me just how many people are like this."
130,"There really is no room for true freedom or emancipation for women and minorities, inside the neoliberal and capitalist frameworks. The nature of this system itself excludes the possibility of any actual principles and ethics, as it converts everything into a game of maximizing your Excel sheet. Lives, crimes, work, art, beliefs - it's all melted into a uniform amalgamate, where nothing is coherent anymore.

Liberals will never actually care about equality, because in the end of the day they see reality as a balancing sheet. We, as discriminated groups, have piggybacked for the last 5 decades on the random wave, that made emancipatory movements be *in the green* for the neoliberal calculations. But Tara Reade case shows that there's absolutely zero delay, between that balance going below their threshold of profit and liberals going into what we would otherwise consider a deeply reactionary mindset."
131,"This is what I’m hoping as well. I mean we know there will be an element of denial from people for political reasons, but I’m the kind of person who pays attention to current events and follows political news and I’m just now getting caught up with this story."

134,"I thought it's strange how this post, the headline aside, feels less like genuine support for Tara Reade, and more like reactionary whining on behalf of Kavanaugh. No demands to focus on or believe the victims, only a pointless rhetorical question and fake outrage about the librul media."

137,"I *do* disagree with the meme, just because I think that Democrats are significantly more likely to be willing to be loud and critical of politicians and take action against those politicians who are horrid when they are made aware of it.

Take, for example, what happened with Al Franken. When it came to light that Al Franken had acted very inappropriately towards a number of different women, Democrats got him to resign.

It's not a perfect record (for example, Bill Clinton getting away with weird behavior for way too long) but it's better than Republicans who will only work hard to keep Democrats accountable and will always ultimately fall in line to protect horrible people. Take Roy Moore; he lost a bit of initial support from his fellow Republicans when it came to light that he sexually assaulted teenagers, but once Trump said ""I support him still"" the RNC fell in line and gave him their full support.

So yeah, regardless of how much Biden may suck, this is pure propaganda through and through, pushing the notion of ""hurrr both parties are the same, so vote for the actively regressive one that's currently using coronavirus to shut down abortion clinics/don't vote at all because nothing you do matters.""

Disappointed to see the sheer number of non-critical eyes here."

145,"That makes it even more upsetting to me.  Basically the trauma these two women went through is still being used to push a political agenda.

It also depends on what metric you're using. Gender equality? Immigration? Authoritarian tendencies? Health care? I can say, with safety, that we do not employ either Warren's/Bernie's healthcare plans.. and don't intend to. Like, the stuff they're proposing is nowhere close to being on the table. Right now we're behind-the-scenes scrambling for long term solvency in the face of increased strain from our ever-growing elderly population. (I also say this as someone who was over the moon about being able to vote for Elizabeth.)

The political parties here borrow elements from both Democrats and Republicans, so again, superimposing labels doesn't work; the ""pro-business"" shtick oft associated with the GOP ironically holds the most traction with young, city-dwellers here. The closest thing to the Democratic left's trade platform matches the right wingers' one. Social issues? Public land conservation? Those are an even greater mixed bag.

My partner is German and also finds it an odd, reductive talking-point. The cultures between the US and Europe are so, so different, and describing one in the context of the other is more complex than afforded in the above comment."
159,"I went back through some of my old postings to put together a good answer for you, since this is a really complex issue that lots of feminists struggle with.  Here's the best and unfortunately pretty long answer for why feminists support sex workers rights and sex work decriminalization -- which is not the same thing as being pro sex work.    

There is a long tradition in feminism of regarding sex work as no more feminist than marriage, and holding that it's about as possible to make sex work feminist as it is to make marriage feminist. Feminist thinkers Emma Goldman, Alexandra Kollontai, Shulamith Firestone, and Gayle Rubin all articulated this perspective. Both marriage and sex work are based in commoditization of women, and both institutions emerged gradually at the same time in concert with each other as society became patriarchal. In the gender egalitarian and non-patriarchal societies we've observed, there is no sex work, but there is also no marriage. Men and women have sex and relationships freely in more casual and non-exclusive structures.  Most feminists who follow this tradition are no more ""pro sex work"" than they are ""pro marriage,"" but they are always pro-women and anti-patriarchy.  

The idea that marriage is good and sex work is bad is a relatively recent invention in the history of patriarchy.  For most of the history of patriarchy, sex work was blessed and often sanctified as highly as marriage -- the temple prostitution era.  Both women and men would often spend portions of their youth as temple prostitutes before eventually settling down to get married. There was no stigma to sex work for a long time during the early transitional era and middle era of patriarchy, and doing sex work was considered honorable and harmless. In the early private prostitution era, sex workers often were granted more legal rights than married women and were frequently considered to be of a higher social class than married women.  Not until the intensification of patriarchy in the fourth century AD did any society outright ban sex work, and then it was because of changing world conditions of greater inter-nationalistic militarism and increased need for replacing the population quickly, which required keeping more women focused on giving birth inside married child raising structures.  So modern sex work stigma has always been about forcing more women into childbearing and childraising roles, where women’s promiscuous sex and free living of any kind is judged deviant and harmful to society.  Up until the 1950s in the United States, both sex workers and any other ""promiscuous women"" were arrested and imprisoned in the name of public health without much distinction between the two groups.

Now let’s look at marriage.  Marriage originated as a way for men to identify their heirs for land inheritance.  This required men's total control and ownership over a woman's sexuality and reproduction, which led to the elimination of women's rights, the stigmatization of women's sexuality, and the violent oppression of women.  For most non-privileged women worldwide, marriage today is still a site of sexual exploitation, sexual assault, abuse, and violence. Even for privileged women, marriage often results in emotional exploitation, labor imbalance, and a fair amount of “maintenance sex,” which is similar to sex work except it is trading for relationship security instead of money.  Large numbers of young girls are trafficked into marriage, similarly large numbers of adult women are trafficked into marriage, many women are economically coerced into marriage, many other women are socially coerced into marriage. Marriage and coupled romance are the leading cause of murder of women by a long shot.  

Even gender egalitarian marriages reinforce patriarchy, because marriage is based on concepts of control and ownership. Patriarchy is more than just gender inequality, it's a bunch of other harmful power-based social relational concepts too. Historically marriage was a man's near total control and ownership of women. Today, for a minority of people, it means two people agreeing to equal, softer measures of control and quasi-ownership rights over each other, which they can end when they wish, but they often don't due to toxic social pressures to ""make it work"" and ""be committed"" and ""try harder."" People agree to these marital arrangements because they are a hegemonic cultural norm, specifically amatonormativity. In a free and non-patriarchal world, agreeing to live that way would be anathema to all of us. 

So if you want to understand the perspective of feminists who are pro sex workers rights, that framework is a good place to start. The view would be: no, sex work is not particularly feminist, but neither is marriage and we still advocate for laws and protections to make marriage less awful for women, like domestic violence laws, prohibitions on child marriage and marital rape, equitable divorce and child custody, women's shelters, paternal leave policies, equitable division of housework. Those policies all help women, but none of those policies are perfect and they are not completely effective at reducing the many harms of marriage. Arguably, those policies also help keep marriage popular and therefore perpetuate the ills of marriage at the same time they marginally improve marriage. But it would be a bad idea to try to make marriage worse and more deadly for women in it in attempt to discourage women from getting married, and it probably wouldn’t work. The goal is to eliminate patriarchy, but you do that by gradually de-intensifying it, not by trying to bring a 10,000 year old social system crashing down all at once, which will almost certainly lead to quick massively increased harm and suffering for hundreds of millions of women.    

The argument is that feminists should take the same perspective and make sex work safer by giving sex workers more legal rights, labor rights, and human rights so they can live their lives safely, end the stigma against sex work so that sex workers can leave sex work and work in another field and convince someone to hire them and not have all their new coworkers being aghast and clutching their pearls at having a former voluntary sex worker as a coworker and refusing to associate with them, and so that sex workers can do sex work without constant fear of eviction or having their bank accounts cancelled or having their friends arrested for helping them with their business or having their money stolen by cops or getting raped by cops. This is what sex workers rights is about, and it is why a lot of feminists fight for it. Making sex work safer, fairer, less stigmatized, and more dignified for women won’t destroy patriarchy tomorrow, but it will be another step towards de-intensifying patriarchy along the road to total replacement of patriarchy."
160,You're right sex work and the patriarchy are inextricably linked. I also struggle with this same thing. I dont begrudge sex workers because they're doing what they need to to survive but I hate the idea of legitimizing something so damaging to women.
161,"It is a very controversial topic and I feel like it often doesn’t get nuanced enough even in feminist circles. 

It gets pushed very heavily that it is just a normal job like all other jobs, but this isn’t true. 
It is true that a lot of people make money by offering different services where they use physical labour, but the act of having sex with someone can’t be compared because of how psychologically and emotionally linked it us for us. There is a reason why having sex with someone against their will one time (rape) is a crime that gets punished hard and often leaves a deep psychological impact on the victim, while making someone cut another persons hair against their will one time isn’t such a big deal. 

Saying that having sex is a job like all other jobs and no big deal is not nuanced. 
If is was a job like all other jobs then I guess the government can say they won’t give unemployed people money before they have applied for a job at the local brothel. It’s just a job like all other Jobs right? 
Another point to make is, is it really consent and your own choice if your financial situation forced you to say Yes? 

Sex workers are overrepresented by the already most vulnerable in society. Foreigners, women of color, victims of abuse and poverty, people with chronic illnesses, LGBT kids who got kicked out when they came out of the closet etc. It doesn’t feel right for me to legalize the exploitation of these further. 

Not to mention Wherever prostitution has been legalized human trafficking has increased since the demand for sex workers exceeds the number of women who are willing to do it voluntarily, so it is not true that it will be better with a government regulating legal sex work. 

Some women might feel a fake sense of empowement because they get a lot more money than they are used to doing sex work, but there is a difference between feeling empowered and actually being empowered. Here, you just got rewarded for helping maintain patriarchal views that says a womens value lies between her legs.

To me, one of the most horrible and least feministic societies I could imagine living in, is a society where abortion is illegal but prostitution is legal. These societies already exist and they do not have a good view on women. If your country doesn’t already have full access to abortion, then Please don’t advocat for legalizing prostitution."
162,"> There's not really any basis on which to call sex work inherently immoral

*Of course* there is. In the presence of widespread poverty, and discrimination of various social minority groups, certain activities are no longer ""just an option"", ""a matter of consent"", no matter risky they would be - one option means no choice. Informed consent can no longer be presumed in such conditions.

> as, first, morality is constructed 

Those are some fighting words. What's next, we have no basis to condemn murder or rape? Is this your first discussion on the matter?

>and, second, things like selling nudes and stripping are not, in and of themselves, harmful to anyone. 

As expected, zero effort given to matters of vitiated consent - when PTSD, compulsion, history of abuse, insufficient mental capacities/information, etc, would make any formal consent irrelevant.

I understand it is difficult to talk about such delicate subjects, and that even some purported feminists might take issues with raising this, but you are ignoring some core issues."
163,"Isn't this just an economics question? Supply and demand. 

People want sex therefore demand. People also want money therefore they supply services. Not sure if it needs a patriarchy to understand this issue."
164,"Thank you, this is exactly the kind of response I was hoping for"
165,"> sex work and the patriarchy are inextricably linked

I feel this is really important."
166,"If prostitution is illegal, that's when you get pimps providing 'protection'. If it is legal then they have full access to the police to help them and can operate as sole traders. People who pay for sex don't care if it is legal but you can make it safer for the women."
167,"I guess I phrased this wrong yeah. I mostly meant in a vacuum. Like in an ideal world where those systemic issues don’t exist and people are just making the informed choice to become a sex worker, I personally don’t feel there’s anything terribly wrong because unlike murder I don’t think there’s any direct harm in exchanging money for a service. To say that morality was constructed is a bit stupid I guess. I think it’s both subjective and objective, but what I was really trying to say is that in a hypothetical situation in which vitiated consent isn’t an issue I don’t think there’s any harm done by selling nudes or something like that. The action itself is not inherently immoral in my opinion. The whole reason I said I felt negatively towards sex work as is was because there are broader societal issues (I just used the word patriarchy that’s my bad) that impair people’s ability to effectively make the informed decision to do sex work, though I guess I could’ve been more specific."
168,"Would you want to do sex work for a job voluntarily? Perhaps you will say ""If I have to to survive, yes"" but can you imagine how damaging it must be to you to have to do that to survive?"
169,"Yes it is. And I meant inextricably lol, I changed it. I think you got what I was saying though haha"
170,"Not voluntarily - the salary is terrible and it goes down over time. We would be better off discussing poverty and why people are forced into desperate situations to make a living rather than moralising about other people's choices. 

My point was more that economic systems exist and those are far more dehumanizing than our social systems."
171,I did understand what you meant. I fixed mine too. Thank you.

You don't even know how there are cases of violence and harassment EVERYDAY so much that it's seen as a natural part of life and women are expected to put up with. You don't know how Turkish people see this shit on media EVERYDAY that most people are bored of these news by now, and the ones media show are like 1% of the real situation. These people take lives of women like it's nothing, trade them like objects, hurt and degrade them into submission from their fucking childhood, marry girls in their early 10's, and overall make some woman's life somewhere in the world unbearable. The ones in the jail aren't even every sex offender. I kid you not those are less than half of the actual sex offenders in Turkey. And they aren't even releasing all the prisoners. They are releasing these pieces of shit who killed their wives or their girlfriend who broke up with them or some random girl who told them no, in the biggest priority. Political prisoners in Turkey are the most harmless of all because they're literally putting anyone who criticizes the government over Twitter there. You see the point? People who took women's lives are seen at bigger priority than random guys on Twitter who tweeted that the president is a dumbass. Now you still argue it's the ""carcel feminists""?"
188,Ah yes releasing dangerous criminals is good
189,"Lame take, bud. 

I absolutely agree that governments need to reduce the prison population, but they need to do it by releasing nonviolent criminals and giving early release to ones who are nearing the end of their sentences and have a solid track record of good behaviour and rehabilitation. 

They should absolutely not be releasing rapists and domestic abusers.

194,"In the US, definetely. Tough if I lived there I'd just try to move out. 

There are quite a few countries where people in general, and women in particular are much safer, and where gun ownership is much more strictly regulated. 

In real life I doubt gun ownership actually helps women defend themselves. Women tend not to be into guns as much as men, and in most of the situations where rape occurs a gun would be useless or illegal. Most rapes occurs between acquaintances or in families, or in situations in which alcohol is involved."
195,"That isn't what I meant, obviously they shouldn't be in prison in the first place"
196,Nice of you to move the goalposts. No one is suggesting we keep weed kids locked up if they are not rehabilitated. We were talking about sex offenders and domestic abusers.
197,Yeah but why is it the sex offenders but not the kid who happened to carry some weed or the guy who dissed the president on Twitter? Why is it the guy who killed his wife with torture?
198,Fuck you. People who hurt others don't matter more than the people they hurt.

201,"Definetely not. In western Europe, especially in scandinavian countries, guns are very strictly regulated. Noone has the right to carry a gun openly or concealed unless it's part of their job, and the only people who own guns are collectors, hunters or sport shooters. The guns have to be locked in a safe, separate from the ammunition. 

You'll find that these countries have a much lower rate of crime, including sexual assault, than the US. For reasons unrelated to gun ownership touh."
202,How? How does their safety matter more than the public?
203,They do. But just releasing them into society without rehabilitation isn't good for both the prisoner nor society. It does more harm than good.
204,"I wrote a book and my agent is a woman. So is my editor. The first is in her fifties and the other in her forties. I was in my early twenties at the time.

I went to a promotional event that was being managed by a man roughly my age. He told my editor that it was nice seeing a woman support her man's dreams. Then spent thirty minutes rambling to my agent about how he was going to make her son (me) big with all his hard work and contacts. This included trying to explain to her how the writing world works.

For the record, this guy had recently been hired and was a wedding DJ prior to this.

I don't know how either of them handled him with the level of poise and dignity that they did, but it made me realize that things like that were so common for them that they could just sip their drinks and give each other amused looks. This was really the first moment I realized how many people there are out there that can't see a woman as anything but some sort of attachment to a man.

Other Greek states and cultures at the time, although battling constantly, saw it more as a bother than something to focus on. Men where expected to be the intellectuals of the state, and war was a distraction, something barbaric. Sparta on the other hand focused all its efforts on turning its men into fighting machines. For Spartan men, critical thinking and studies were secondary. Also, thanks to this almost cult-like approach to war, the men where far from home most of their lives. This, combined with the fact that many women became widow very early in life thanks to the constant battles and the ridged honor codes about dying on the battlefield, let a vacuum in everyday life. In Athens, men would regulate and study, but in Sparta, most men died too young and too often to keep up such a system. I think women just took their chances and filled the gaps left by men. Its comparably to the women after the first world war. They realized how much potential they had in the absence of men and more or less took their chance. Spartan men did not really object to this (at least in my understanding) because of their believe that men themselves only lived for battle, and as such they did not have such hangups about women taking on more dominant roles in fields that Spartan men weren't interested in in the first place.

To summarize: Women got high positions because Sparta had no other choice. You can't use your male population in constant war and expect enough of them to survive to keep your society running. Women just had to step in to keep it all from collapsing in on itself."

221,"It's interesting how war seems to do that. Had a conversation with my WW2-obsessed grandfather about how conservatives seem to be under the impression that women in the workforce began as an evil liberal plot to destroy family values, when the reality is that it was practically necessary for women to enter the workforce when huge swaths of the male population - who had previously been the workers - were suddenly drafted overseas."
222,"And even if it weren't because of the war, it has nothing to do with a desire to ""destroy family values"", and everything to do with ""equality"" and ""freedom""."
223,"My aunt is a victim of domestic violence. No physical violence, but psychological. She's in Italy, can't leave the house. She doesn't even recognise to be a victim, it's kind of like Stockholm syndrome.

However, she's spiralling into depression. She already suffered from it, but at least her husband wasn't at home during the day. And the same with her two sons, who agree with the husband and insult her/threaten her. She's living with three men, all three adults, who abuse her psychologically day in and day out. And the rest of the family is minimizing it. She doesn't think she's a victim. She says that losing her family in her 50s would be worse than having to endure all the pain, so she refuses to leave the house.
However, she started drinking and has suicidal tendencies.

I'm in Italy too, but I'm away from her and we can't move, so there's nothing we can do to help, except call her and see how she's doing.

I'm absolutely terrified, I've been having nightmares about this situation for a week now, and there's no end in sight for the lockdown. It's necessary for the physical health of the whole country, I understand this. But mental health is being neglected during these times. Not leaving the house for weeks is driving people crazy, even those who are generally healthy. The others must be dying for this to end."
224,I fucking hate how predictable this shit is.
225,My god.  These are dark days indeed.
226,I was just wondering about this as the tension in my own house has been rising a bit. Dang. Solutions breed problems. Hopefully these problems breed solutions.
227,"We knew this was coming, and we also know this problem will be largely ignored."

229,And no doubt child abuse as well. Horrific.
230,Sounds about right. I'm living in hell.
231,This makes me so sad. I'm holed up on my farm alone during this and was having one of my moments regretting not settling down already because having this time to spend with someone I love would be amazing. Then I see stuff like this. It's just heartbreaking what we do to each other.

Can't we have a break ?"
233,"It is because of all the things that happen during this time. Its not just a long period of isolation its also lack of financial security, job losses and it becomes harder to access alcohol, drugs and other needs.

I'm from NZ and we are day 4 of the month in Stage 4 lockdown with only supermarkets, pharmacies and petrol stations open. On our first day our Prime Minister gave funds to social services charities like Women's refugee for ""women and children who need to leave their homes""

This time will be devastating for many but I'm thankful our govt acknowledged that and addressed a solution to leave even when the full msg is to stay home

I also hope women who are in these situations now have the time to realise how awful things are and hopefully can mentally prepare for getting tf out."

235,I’m so sorry and I feel you on this. My father has a horrible temper but since he is a workaholic I didn’t have to put up with it much. Now that he can’t go to work he’s treating me like a child and yelling at me over the stupidest things. I feel mentally exhausted from walking on eggshells and I want to just travel to where my brother is at and just stay there until it’s all over. I would be exposing my immunocompromised self but at this point I don’t know how much longer I can take this.
236,Indeed. It so heartbreaking.
237,"They don't think it's okay to be violent, they fully believe they are not violent. And if they use physical force, it's 100% justified because someone/something made them do it and it was the only logical consequence.

It's like how no rapist ever believes they raped someone.

All just misunderstandings/people twisting what really happened.   

That's what makes these fuckers so dangerous."
238,yes. Indeed. I might say WWIII just started.
239,I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. He sounds like a raging jerk. I wish these guys could see how ridiculous they look. It's weak and pathetic to throw temper tantrums demanding everyone live in fear. It's virtually impossible to get through to guys like that. I hope you have peace soon
240,"This is unfortunately the case. One of my own children is mentally ill, and thinks of themselves as a victim all the time, no matter what they're doing, even if that means blocking their spouse from leaving the room or throwing things at someone. I think in a lot of cases it's learned behavior, but in this case it's an overactive defense mechanism against self-hatred. Thank heaven they have roommates. 
It's amazing how people can be so deluded and still understand what they can and cannot get away with. That's the key, making sure they know they are seen and that consequences will happen."
241,Exactly. They are incapable of understanding. They fully believe their anger and rage is justified. They think you're supposed to understand them. It's narcissism. It's a baby brain which never matured. They are control freaks.
242,I had no idea! That is seriously frightening. It makes sense with the ‘Why do you make me hit you’ stuff I’ve heard about so often. This is an eye opener.
243,You can thank religions (99% of all) also. Remember that some gods consider women to be a lesser human.
244,"I doubt there's any that doesn't view women as lesser. Varying degrees, but even Jainism believes that women must do good things and be reborn as men before they can attain moksha. Sikhism I think has no ideas denigrating women, but the same cannot be said of the culture followed by Sikh people."
245,"Honestly does it matter?

Seriously how much change can the president make if the real power (money, corporations, lobbies) will fight any social change that effects the ability to extort the population?"
246,"I'd guess more than one might expect. Trump has gotten a lot done (maybe not *good* things, but a surprising amount of things overall) by the power of the Executive Order, and even if the President is hamstrung, they have diplomatic influence both nationally and internationally. This is the kind of thing that justifies Bernie's slogan of ""Not me, us."""

252,"I was thinking it was gonna talk about punishing Dinah.
Like how it works in Saudi. 
You get raped, you're either married or unmarried.
If you're unmarried it's sex before marriage so punishment.
If your married then it's sex outside marriage then punishment.
Basically you can rape without consequence."
253,"Screw that, drink lots and have an orgy!!

Edit: Consenting orgy*"
254,"The rest of the story isn't much better - Dinah's brothers get angry and kill the guy who raped her. Then the author claims that this dreadful chain of events that led to murder was all Dinah's fault, because she decided to associate with people who weren't of the same faith.

This is from the book ""My Book of Bible Stories"", for anyone who's interested. Lovely illustrations, terrible interpretation of the Bible"
255,"I grew up very Christian and I agree, I didn't get very good advice about love and sexual relationships from all the time I spent at Church and reading the Bible. Although I feel like I took some very positive life lessons from Christianity (humility and grace), my time at church taught me very little about respectful romantic relationships."
256,"The book was given to me by a woman who was a Jehovah's Witness. Our family was a mix of evangelical and lutheran, but the lady was very nice and respectful to my family so my mom let her come over all the time."
257,">kill the guy who raped her.

That's kind of an understatement. They kill his entire town, using infection by circumcision as their weapon of choice. Which I find hilarious in its own way - they use the sacred ritual that symbolizes the covenant with their god and use it as a bio weapon to weaken their foe. 

Seeing people today using this story to teach kids you only should rape your spouse seems somehow fitting in its perverted morality."
258,Have you read The Red Tent? It’s written from Dinah’s perspective and it gives her agency and power and explores the lives of women in the camp. It’s got a twist on that very scene where Dinah chooses to sleep with him and they plan on getting married but her brothers want war so they use it as an excuse to loot the city.
259,Ahhh childhood memories
260,"That's absolutely terrible, ugh why are they teaching this to children"
261,Yeah they're nice people in my experience. I grew up in that religion and some of my family is still in it. I just could never get past the misogny and homophobia to enjoy the stories.
262,"No, but it sounds like an interesting read!"
263,"That's how male supremacy works.

Oh, something is a disadvantage to women? Well it must be natural and there's no issues there.

Wait, did you say men are being affected? HOL UP"
264,"When men fail, society failed them, But when women fail, they failed themselves and society. :/"
265,"You've hit the nail pretty hard on the head. It's not just careers and school, it's really most things were this applies. It's basically gender essentialism, anti-feminism, and in a lot of cases,  victim blaming. If you just look at anything they say, it's just raw bigotry at every argument.

Meanwhile, if you point out that men die earlier because they choose to not go to the doctor, choose to continue horrible habits like smoking and drinking, choose to do risky behavior, and have the gall to point out the issue of toxic masculinity and it's role in those shitty decisions, you'd have MRA types PMing you and replying about how you don't understand men's issues in society."
266,Another thing I see pointed out quite often is how men tend to successfully commit suicide more often than women but these same people ignore the fact that women tend to commit suicide more often just in not as lethal ways as men and thus make up less of the successful suicide statistic. I find that interesting because the successful suicide rate is often pointed out by MRAs showing how men are being failed by society but the women statistic is ignored. Because society can only fail men and women wellllll thats just how they are right? Perhaps the real issue is more complicated and when society fails people its because the patriarchal model is more punishing for both men and women??? Crazy idea...unless
267,"My “favorite” argument is the one about custody. They blame women for being passed up for promotions and raises because they’d “rather” care for their children, and then lose their minds when those same women then get primary custody after their marriage ends. Like...which is it? Do you want more equitable workplaces and home lives where not one party is expected to sacrifice professional opportunities because they became a parent? Or do you want to complain about the status quo only because it doesn’t 100% benefit men?"
268,"When they first designed WAIS IQ test, girls got a higher IQ score than boys overall so they added in sports statistic questions that (boys would have had more familiarity with) to ""even it out""  


I'm Gen X and the kinds of fields i wanted to work in were male dominated (science/art/creativity) and most places would not give me a second glance because ""I'm just going to get married and quit to raise kids"" and the training would be ""wasted"" on me. I wish I could go back not to all those asshole and say ""see! I never had kids. I didn't want to then and so are you proud that you excluded me?"" I know they wouldn't give a shit though. Who wants a female around that might not appreciate locker talk and ""having a female around ruins the atmosphere"" and yaddayadda

270,Great post! I’ve saved it to see if any really interesting comments come out of it.
271,"I agree that there is hypocrisy there. What is your actual stance on the first point, do you agree that the current educational system doesn't work as well for boys as it should and that some reform is required?"
272,"Guess you just noticed that our society is insane for everyone, just in different topics, but that doesn't change the fact that men are privileged in many more ways from the economical system than women. 
And this is not about being rich; just... I think it's easier realizing yourself if you have the means and your problem is at a social level. There are so many campaign, if you want to search them, to promote self care and self positivity; but if you are confident enough to desire and plan your own life and you miss money, which would actually be something super useful for everything, you stop at the beginning. 
Obviously I'm not saying that psychic issues are less important than economical ones, they're just often easier to solve. 

And that's what feminism should do: solve our society's problems by simply saying we're all equals, in everything, and that that's how it should be because nature made us together and similar, not socially distanced. 

Sorry if my English's not perfect, not mother tongue and I'm writing this with just one hand :)))"
273,So is society failing everyone or is everyone choosing to fail?
274,"A thoughtful observation!

My position is somewhere in the middle. I don't look at boys doing worse at school and think this is a result of some kind of social oppression. I think a simpler explanation would be that girls mature more quickly and are more agreeable (both on average). And good for them! Similarly, a pay differential (on average), could be explained later in life by the same phenomena. I am making no judgement here about whether this is fair or not or if we have a moral imperative to intervene."
275,[removed]
276,"Agreed with all of this.

Also, as women enter a ""dangerous workforce"" the safety measures go up. Women tend to demand more safety measures and protections.

Like I'll agree that society does tend to act more paternalistic about women's health and safety, and accepts a woman asking for increased safety measures as natural, whereas a man doing the same is ""emasculated"". And that's a big issue for mens health and safety. But that's also part of the whole toxic masculinity problem. People demand that men act strong, tough, and anything less is deemed pathetic and ""womanly""."
277,"yes! MRAs bring up the argument that taking care of kids is a woman's job and then also complain that men don't get custody???

perhaps the real issue is patriarchal systems that dictate women are caretakers and men aren't??? which feminists have always pointed out???"

280,"Education in general needs an overhaul, not just for boys. Education is failing girls too when it comes to certain subjects, especially after puberty when gendered stereotypes start to become more intense.

But truly education is failing everyone. There's a massive disconnect between how people learn optimally and how we currently teach. And a big disconnect between what skills and knowledge are needed to live and thrive, and how its currently done. 

Also people fall prey to the idea that talents are only handed to you at birth and if you're not good at certain subjects right away then the system basically tells you to give it up and focus on a different area, which is extremely limiting, especially for children with learning disabilities."
281,"This is simplistic of the actual issue. Girls do tend to mature faster but it's because there is more pressure on them to act ""right"" boys are typically socialized to know it's okay if they act ""wild"" because people believe that that's just how boys are. When in reality, the girl would be just as ""wild"" except that parents and teachers tend to be much harsher on girls who are so. 

Girls are ""agreeable"" for the same reason. They have been taught that behaving ""like a boy"" comes with harsh discipline. Girls who have younger siblings are also expected to do more household work, whereas a boy in the same situation is often just given free reign to ignore dishes and laundry. 

Boys are just as capable of being ""mature"" but they aren't disciplined as harshly for the same things as girls.

Also, because boys are socialized differently, they tend to believe intelligence/ability is innate, that they either can do it or they can't. Girls on the other hand, who are socialized to know nothing will be handed to them, tend to believe intelligence/ability can be learned or trained, so they study more and harder while the average boy simply gives up."

286,"Yeah, as an elementary school teacher who has worked on three continents now, I can say that this whole “girls mature faster than boys” is very  cultural. 

In particular when I lived in India, it was the girls who were chatty and distracted during class, whereas the boys in general were the most studious.  They took school very seriously from a young age. 

On another note, I did my very best creating a classroom environment where everyone should be curious."

289,"Great episode.
Just listened to it today.

It's great that we gave an acceptance of different lifestyles and sexual activies through popular culture but it's absolutely insane that we have people using it as an actual, legal defence for murder, accidental death or abuse.

I'm 35. I haven't dated in about 10 years. Never did the online thing.
Forgetting those just trying to abuse or hurt for a moment...
Is it a more common kink now?
If so:
Is it people trying out what they're seeing in porn?
Is it because of it's newer ""mainstream"" status?

Have those of you currently dating/hooking up found more of this coming up in the bedroom or talked about even before then?

Are you in to it now/recently whereas previously it didn't really come up or interest you?"
290,">Maybe this is a rant, maybe a question. I don’t know, I am exhausted trying to argue for women’s health and not being backed by fellow women.

Some people can't be argued against and you have to know when to give your viewpoint then walk away. We're all fighting against the patriarchy and men and women both support it. Just because they are women doesn't mean they are feminists or care about equality."
291,"I can’t tell you exactly how you can get your point of view across to your religious, pro-lifer friends, but I can tell you what they’re thinking. I was part of a non-denominational (it wasn’t hardcore) Christian church and when we had this debate there were mixed opinions. All the staunch pro-lifers fully believed that a foetus was a person and that killing them in the womb was murder. On the case of rape, they would say that two wrongs don’t make a right (that even if she was raped, an abortion is still murder and is worse). 

The only way to get through to them was for me to say- yes, I absolutely agree with you. But blocking abortion isn’t the law to push in! Instead, we should make men get mandatory vasectomies. After all, even if a women chooses to be abstinent she can still get raped and become pregnant, but if men have vasectomies them this wouldn’t be an issue. 

If they disagree because it’s violating men’s bodily rights then you can point out their double standards. I’ve never had anyone agree with me so I’m not sure what you’d say then"
292,"THey're only pro-fetus.  As soon as the kid is born, you're on your own."
293,"I have never been in such an argument luckily, I am surrounded by like minded people, but often wonder if the natural rate of miscarriage is something that should be brought up. 1 in 3 pregnancies that we know of end in miscarriage (last I checked). A lot of people probably have miscarriages that they think are periods. The rights of a ball of cells that may or may not genetically survive do not equal the rights of a full human being period. And I just think, as someone who has experienced miscarriage, that if we had less stigma around it, if we knew how common it is, then we’d be less emotional about abortion."
294,"Plenty of women are anti-feminists and misogynistic. In my own family, some of the older generation of women, don’t believe in women’s basic human rights. So no wonder that there these kinds of women who will categorically oppose another woman’s absolute right to decide what she wants to do with her own body. But I’ve met younger women, with similar believes as well, who have been brainwashed and have no informed opinions of their own but they still regurgitate this kind of thinking over and over."
295,"It’s almost as if they have this warped idea of what equality is?

I agree, I should walk away. But when I am closing off a conversation I get the “you need to hear us out” or “typical liberals... they always want to shut down a conversation because they can’t prove a point”.

I don’t what is hard to comprehend about this issue. They believe in all these “exception cases” that would be costly/timely/ near impossible to prove before an abortion could be had. I just.... feel I’m living in the past."
296,I actually laughed out loud. That's genius. OP pls try this 😂

Her husband. Her clothing store. Her financial burden. Her painful experience in the name of ""tradition.""

I'm so used to articles contorting around themselves to frame every woman as peripheral to the men in their lives that these phrases felt like typos to read.  

I'm used to a world where when a woman and her children were set on fire by their deranged husband and father that it's only his name in the paper, along with some useless trivia like what sport he played in high school, so the reader knows which family member to sympathize with.  

This... is a step in the right direction."
303,"This is so devastating to see women being treated this way, making a husband look like as of they're the pinnacle of a woman's life and making his death look like the destruction of her life. I pray that this stops and for women to be strong as hell to protest against such cruel and unjust treatment towards."
304,The way that widows are treated is insane. This shit and bride burning. Its weird how so many cultures decided that men need to be treated like Gods and husbands are the ultimate authority in the household. That's what the threat of violence and unchecked power will get you

She organized Christmas cards and calendars with pictures of us all for my grandparents who only saw us once a year, worked tirelessly at Christmas time to buy presents for everyone, send them off to extended family, wrap each and every present for my brother and I, each with a personalized note, and stick them under the tree, that she chose and decorated in the first place.

She has worked SO HARD to be a good mother, while also working her ass off as a real estate agent, then a caretaker, and now someone who works under real estate agents, basically doing all their grunt work, all of this while continuing to put dinner on the table every night. I am in awe of my mom.
My parents fought ALL THE TIME and even when I was little, I knew they didn’t love each other. My mom felt their was too much responsibility on her part, my dad felt like she was complaining too much when he was working so hard with his business all day long. They recently got divorced (thank god), though my mom still lives with us (but recently got her own place, it’s just needing some work before she moves in yay!) and suddenly my dad is stepping up and doing all the things my mom has been asking him to do for literally two decades. 
I love my dad, but sometimes I resent him for never seeing how much shit my mom deals with and how much she really does."
316,"This is, of course, reinforced by the older generations. I’ll never forget the first Christmas my husband and I were married— his mother sent me and ONLY me their “Christmas lists” (and if you ask me, grown adults having Christmas lists are an entire other issue unto itself). Like it was my responsibility to go out and buy all the Christmas gifts for their family, despite working retail full time and managing my own family and social obligations. I made it a rule from that moment on that he was 100% responsible for making plans and buying  gifts for his family. This arrangement is threefold: I don’t have to worry about it, we save money on gifts, and I rarely see my mother-in-law."
317,If you feel this talk to your partner. It might take some communication but you can get them to understand that remembering all these details are their responsibility too.
318,"Part of the ‘triple shift’ - domestic/ housework, a career, and this emotional labour"
319,"I consider myself quite lucky to have been raised by a feminist father.  He was a stay at home dad and did most of the housework, plus driving me to school and helping with homework.  Now my partner and I share the load, and if I'm being honest, he may even do more than I do."
320,My dad and mom are like this. It took some work but my husband and I found a good balance in our relationship although it did take some ups and downs to get here. Its frustrating because so many people don't hold men accountable for the most basic tasks.
321,"So much of my depression stems from having ADHD but being unaware of it until I was 27, and being unable to reliably take the load that was expected of me. Not that any of us should have to be the support staff of our families, but the feelings of inadequacy are real."
322,This is still an issue for me and my boyfriend. He blames it on his forgetfulness when I ask him to do something and how he can’t read minds if I don’t ask him to do it.
323,"Thank you. This is a huge burden on women and is overlooked. I've stopped acting as a 'diary' for my boyfriend. He would constantly ask me to remind him of events etc. and it added to my already overloaded schedule.

If he doesn't remember, he doesn't remember and that is his issue."
324,"Thank you! I learnt the term studying sociology, it seems women always carry the full weight of domestic life"
325,"I had an epiphany this week about the stereotype of men not being able to locate things in their own house and how it is tied to the mental load. 

Men don’t know where anything is kept in the house because their partner has taken on the mental load of knowing when things are running out and where they keep replacements. 

“Did you even look?” You say as as you get the thing. They shrug. But it’s right fucking there, right in front of their eyes. If they had been keeping tabs on how much we had in the house or done the shopping and put things away, they’d have a better idea of where things are kept and how much there is left. But because they have absolved themselves if this responsibility, they also don’t know/care where anything is kept. Then they “can’t find” them, and never learn because they don’t  have that mental burden.

And so it goes on."
326,And then the men in her life ask her why she seems so tired or cranky......
327,"I'm grateful that my current boyfriend shares some of the mental load. He makes lists, checks safety of products, keeps things clean when I have a work day and cooks too. I probably feel an increased responsibility to do things even when I don't have to do them despite this. Luckily he was raised by a working mom and stay at home dad so he has good role models for healthy masculinity. :)"
328,"Yep! I feel this so hard lol. I've talked about this with my husband and while he has gotten better about it, I'm still the one who does the meal planning and keeping tracking of events. It's not that he thinks it's my responsibility, but those things just aren't that important to him. He could probably eat the same thing every day and be totally fine but I can't (and I do enjoy trying new recipes) so it's why I do most of the meal planning. Same thing for birthdays. He doesn't care about them, but I do, so again it's me taking charge."
329,"Thank you for capturing this so clearly! It’s hard to put into words and even show (duh, it’s invisible labor), but this really nailed it"
330,I’ve started listening to the audiobook “the Wife Drought” by Annabel Crabb and it’s touching on this quite a bit - highly recommend!
331,"I hate shit like this, not the idea of invisible labor, but the way it’s presented here...I number one feel like it’s presented in a very heteronormative way and number two feel like it lowkey rights off working women/mothers by assuming they are the ones performing this labor (I know it typically has been)"
332,"I'm a female and very much struggle with this. I have a hard time identifying things like dishes being in the sink means I need to do dishes, or dirt on the floor means I need to sweep. I *see* the problem, but it doesn't always register that the problem needs to be fixed. I'll get frustrated about it until I stop and actively think about how to solve the problem, and then I'll tell myself that I need to grab a broom. It might be a week later that I make that connection. It isn't me being lazy, I have no problem working at all. It6s identifying and processing the idea that there's a job to do in the first place.

Apparently this is a symptom of several things, including (but not limited to) autism spectrum disorders, add/adhd, anxiety, and depression."

334,My sister-in-law works harder and makes more than her husband AND is expected to do 80% of these jobs as well.
335,"Guy here coming from /r/all/, 33 with 2 kids, with an honest question. I don't really have any guy friends so I can't relate to them but I often feel like exactly the way the picture is, and it often prevents me from sleeping well.

Is that really still an issue in 2020 with today's generation? 

I understand it was kinda the way things were for my parents and my girlfriend's parents. Our mothers both stayed at home and took care of everything. Our father came home from work and they would just eat, sit down to watch TV and then go to bed. I've never seen my father cook, do laundry, do cleaning or any household chores.

However nowadays if you want to make the ends meat, both person in a couple need to have full time jobs, so I would except most couples to actually share the load evenly. Is that not the case?"
336,"While this whole thing sucks and I empathize, this is not what ""emotional labor"" is. That is when your job requires that you present certain emotions for them, e.g. retail workers needing to act smiley and happy in front of customers all the thing. The term should only be used in the context of an actual job where your outward emotions are a part of your uniform."
337,[removed]
338,YES the in-laws always trying to reinforce that.
339,Except holiday cards... nobody has to do those- that is just self-inflicted pain
340,"Sure, in some cases.  In other cases, they partner is just comfortable abdicating adult responsibilities creating a parent/child dynamic with their spouse, which no one wants."
341,Lol it’s a bit more complicated than that usually
342,"I’ve never heard of the triple shift, but I just learned in my sociology of sexuality and gender class about the second shift, meaning since women entered the workforce, they still do all or most of the housework at home in a marriage or relationship with a man. Even if men do some of the housework, it is usually not to the same level or quality that a woman does it, so it creates more work and more exhaustion for women. The added emotional labor seems to be another valid point, women’s minds are more focused on the “to do” list. Thank you for bringing this up! I hadn’t thought about it that way and I enjoy the point of view you brought to the discussion!"
343,That sounds amazing and like a good way to recognize healthy behavior and relationships. Which is hard to do if your norm isn't that. Props to your dad.
344,"I have ADHD as well. I ended up being able to stay home with the kids, so things didn't fall apart entirely, but it has been very isolating and some people see me as lazy. Not sure I did such a great job with the kids either, since one of them ended up seriously mentally ill. Not sure if I'm capable of feeling adequate, but it would be nice if I could."
345,"On that note, the term 'emotional labor' was coopted from working class women. It was originally a term for the unwritten job requirements to maintain a pleasant, submissive demeanor at all times that disproportionately falls on women. It's mostly relevant in retail and service jobs, but women in white collar roles are often expected to mediate clients' and coworkers' emotions in a similar way.

Coopting the term 'emotional labor' to describe these invisible household responsibilities (as the title of the graphic itself does) leaves that very real and very serious workplace issue without a descriptive term. And really, there's nothing emotion related about a lot of those things anyway, so it's a little weird."
346,"Not just heteronormative, but it's so focused on traditional gender roles. None of these things should be solely a ""woman's job."" If that is the message it's trying to send I think it's doing a poor job."
347,I have the same issue but it was compounded X10000 when I actually ended up living with my male SO. It felt like not only was he never doing his fair share he was also making my chore list so much longer
348,"Women being better than men at multi tasking is a common myth. 

https://www.sciencealert.com/women-aren-t-better-multitaskers-than-men-they-re-just-doing-more-work

Also notice how you put the responsibility on the woman to manage the man. That’s exactly what we are talking about with invisible labor. It’s not one partners job to teach or manage the other."
349,"Nope. It is common for couples today to both work full time, but the “mental load” is rarely shared still. While having words to describe this dynamic is very helpful, confronting partners who are not accustomed to thinking/doing this kind of stuff is still very difficult. I think this has a lot to do with the behaviors that were modeled for adults when they were growing up."

If they won’t take on their share it’s time to drop some (remembering his family’s birthdays, or planning social outings that include him for example). You don’t have to parent your partner even if that’s what they expect you to do."
356,Seconded. You can talk to your partner til you’re blue in the face but 9 times out of ten he won’t get it
357,"Tbh I agree, I think emotional labour is part of the invisible  labour, not another word for it."
358,"Totally hear you, but I do think that invisible labor/emotional label does fit well with the work mothers have been expected to do and gotten no credit for. This may not be the case as much now but it historically it has been. This graphic doesn’t do a good job of portraying it at all but placing the burden of emotional labor and “invisible labor” on women’s backs has been a huge tool in gender differencing

Edit to Add: The image here is very much aimed toward upper-middle class (white) women, that is why I’m saying it doesn’t portray it"
359,"It's definitely not saying these things should be done by women, it's acknowledging the unpaid work and disproportionate labour women are expected to do. The purpose of this post is to make sure women understand that their extra burden is real, so that they can respond to accusations made, usually by men, that all we can do to fix it is to ""ask men"" or ""tell men what needs to be done"" which is a massive workload all in its own.

Going forward it should DEFINITELY not remain this way."
360,Yea that’s what I meant when I said “writing off working moms.” But yea it’s not good
361,"I just wish that more people would acknowledge that women have this problem as well. Maybe not as many of us, but we do. Since society has deemed women the ""caretakers of the home"" (not agreeing with it, just acknowledging the societal pressures), consistently failing or struggling to meet those standards of the ""perfect wife"" (even when single - who will want to marry you if you can't figure out how to clean!?!) can cause the problem to get worse."

I have a well meaning SO. But all the conversations in the world can't undo the gender roles and upbringing he has had his entire life. 

There has been change, but even trying to convince him to change repeatedly has taken an ungodly amount of effort, tears, and its exhausting. 

So please, have a read through other threads about this issue where women have talked about their stories. It's just not as simple as ""just communicate! :D""

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fm4xtj/women_who_have_been_successful_in_showing_their/

Read most of this thread and you'll get the picture."
364,"I agree completely about the invisible labor expectations. I just don't like that people have coopted the term emotional labor for it. Originally, the sociologist who coined that term also coined the term 'emotion work' to describe gendered expectations in family roles, although I think that term was meant to describe mediating and managing the psychological health of family members, and not things that are more commonly just thought of as housework. 

It absolutely is something people need to be more aware of (and honestly, I think it's weird how many don't even notice it). I just don't like when it's called 'emotional labor' because that's a different thing that also needs awareness."
365,And this perpetuates the notion that house work is women’s main labor/duty women perform emotional labor in far more complex and tiring ways. This looks like their target audience was upper-middle class women
366,"That's assuming that the lady in OP doesn't also work. Notice that the title of the image is ""The Invisible Labor"". It's talking about unpaid, unacknowledged, gendered labour.

It almost always exists on top of a a working mom's normal working duties. Which is more reason why it's so important to highlight."
367,"Completely agree, and the expectations and lack of shared responsibility and mental load in the household can make those issues way worse for women precisely because of what you just mentioned"

369,Exactly. Easier said than done. Well put.
370,"I think that's a bit of an uncharitable and IMO not an accurate reading. 

1. There's so much more to what our society considers to be women's work and to emotional labour than what's in OP,  but there's only so much you can put in one small infographic.

2. Nowhere does it say that it should be this way. I really don't see how you could read OP as saying ""women's main work is house work only""

3. Having said that, housework is still gendered and women get gaslit all the time when we raise this issue.

4. I'm poor, and precisely because I'm poor is exactly why I need male SOs to step up their fucking game and take off some of my mental burden because I can't work full time, study full time and be a given all this weight on my shoulders too. If the lady in OP were wealthy, she would often be hiring maids and domestic workers to unload some of the burden. Poor women are expected to do everything."
371,"I agree with participants at the march that regret going there, as it may have increased the risk of infection. On the other hand, there are plenty of other major factors:

>First, the country has a deeply embedded late-night culture, with everyone staying out late to hang out at bars or simply eat dinner. Second, a paranoia stemming back to Spain’s decades-long dictatorship created a palpable friction between the public and law enforcement.

>The result was that few in Spain felt compelled to change their ways despite signs of chaos. “The Spanish character is not to believe a crisis is coming,” Moro said. “Once you see people die, that’s when you react — but by then it’s too late.”

>Government inaction didn’t help. As mentioned above, Prime Minister Sánchez refused to stop large gatherings like soccer matches and political rallies from proceeding. Some experts I spoke to said that allowing so many people to congregate almost surely spurred a larger outbreak. But Martich, the health policy expert at the University of Carlos III, cautioned that it’s too early to know if that’s truly the case.

My opinion: the march wasn't an inspired idea, given the context, but there were plenty of other major social phenomena in action that unfortunately also helped spread it."

In fact the far right party was holding a rally the same day, and you can see a video of one of the leaders handshaking and hugging everyone only for him to get diagnosed of corona virus two days later.

It was a problem of our country not reacting quickly enough to the threat, and not a ""FeMEnisT BaD SpREadING DISeaSES""""."

How is it feminists' fault that males are more likely to have XY chromosomes? 

Most importantly Covid-19 is affecting womxn class in a far more insidious manner. Rising rates of domestic violence, rape, child marriage, burden of child care, painfully harsh reminder that men are their husbands, and not partners etc..
Also, there are some women with XY chromosomes (both cis and trans) -- do they also have weaker viral immunity due to Y chromosome? Are they also being harshly affected by Covid-19? But then neither society nor medical community care about women whose biology defy their phallocentric norms."

408,">It's not chromosomes that matter. I

People with XX chromosome (majority of whom are women) have stronger viral immunity, longer lifespans, high antibody titres after vaccination, oestrogen receptors, cytotoxic T-cell activity than people with XY chromosomes (majority women). Men with XX chromosome probably have these same advantages over women with XY chromosomes. 

oestrogen has been shown to increase antiviral responses of immune cells. And many genes that regulate the immune system are encoded on the X chromosome (of which men have one, and women have two) and so it is possible that some genes involved in the immune response are more active in women than in men. 

Scientists argue that these sex-specific health disparities may be due, at least in part, to tiny pieces of genetic material called microRNAs. The main function of microRNAs in cells is to turn off, or ""silence,"" specific genes. The microRNAs located on the female X chromosome may give women (who are more likely to have XX chromosome) an immune system advantage over males. The X chromosome contains 10 percent of all microRNAs in the human genome. The Y chromosome has none. Some of the microRNAs on the X chromosome are thought to be involved in immune system function and cancer development.If a microRNA did something ""good,"" like help control cell growth, having two copies of that microRNA might provide females with extra protection against cancer. The same would be true for microRNAs that played a role in immune function."

It's 100% a meaningless gesture and to pretend otherwise shows either delusion or privilege so great that you don't really care about the actual politics of the person you're voting for. I'm I happy that the decision might be between a groper and a rapist? Hell no, but y'all that think Republicans and Democrats are two sides of the same coin or ""two arms of the same corporate party"" have no fucking clue the damage these past four years of Trump have done; **not everyone will survive another four**. Shit, a lot of us won't even survive to see the election the way things are going now. Do you think Justice Ginsberg will survive another four years? Would you want to bet on it? If you lose, you're stuck with an overwhelmingly rightwing supreme court for DECADES. Whose rights do you think will be the first to go?

This isn't a hard fucking choice. And in the end, this choice must be made. Either I help make it. Either I influence that just a little, or I let everyone else choose for me. I'm tired of giving my power away. And I feel worthy to live, so I'm going to choose the party that will help me live."
461,"I voted for another candidate in the primary and would rather have someone else be the Democratic candidate, but not voting for Biden would be irresponsible since it would lead to Trump’s re-election. In this system we are in, no vote or a vote for a third party candidate is enabling Trump."

They feared anything, including correcting lies would look like support. They were so scared if a 2016 repeat, they have become useless. And now you're still blaming them. 

They could have been out there trying to drive the Democrat brand, but they won't to avoid bias."
469,"But voting Democrat has helped? I have family members whose lives were saved by the Affordable Care Act. I have friends and neighbors and coworkers who are only here because of the DREAM Act. I can legally get married, because in 2009 the first black (Democrat) president nominated the first Latina (Democrat) supreme court justice who passed the mandate for marriage equality in a 5-4 decision in 2015. There are young Democrats in the house and senate, right now, with bold plans for saving the environment, reforming immigration law and our criminal justice systems, our election system, our healthcare system. And they can't do jack shit if Trump remains in power. Seriously, I feel like I'm going insane... this view that Democrats are \*exactly like Republicans\* except maybe worse because they ""lie about it"" - would be laughable if it weren't so dangerous. Read a recent history book, read about what's happening *right now* ffs, then tell me that Democrats have never done anything to help."
470,"But I have personal experience of one party helping. Insomuch that it helped me come to terms with my identity, feel whole and happy with who I am for the first time in...30 years. The Democrats fought for that reality and provided a culture of support for me.

The Republicans want me to go away, still. 

So check your privilege. Your life may not change, but many will. I mean, one is actively banning abortion. That has consequences for anyone with a uterus, and anyone that loves them."

A space where sexual harassment/sexual assault allegations are taken seriously, and if proven - result in major consequences (probably most effective with a fair whistleblower system).

In a world where everyone had equal representation in imagery across all subject matter and felt equally empowered and privileged to access opportunity to fulfill their life's purpose, as they define for themselves; in a world without devastating acts of discrimination and violence towards minorities currently happening; without the wounds of genocide, cultural genocide, slavery.... in that world it wouldn't be important to overly emphasize the identities of these two scientists, but in our world it is."
492,"This *is* an exception, because women and people of colour are so often kept from getting the opportunity to perform these kinds of achievements. It's not that it's exceptional that women or poc can do these things - it's exceptional that they managed to even get where they are so that they can show that they can do these things.

Pretending that equality is already here won't lead to equality, it'll just obscure the inequality we have to fight. In the future, it would be wonderful if we could all be colour- and genderblind, but in this world we live in now, that only serves the status quo."

I see a vote as an endorsement. I don't want to give him mine.

If Trump is re-elected it will not be the fault of women like me, it will be the fault of the fact that powerful men love hurting women.

Even if that was just for show, that's still more than Biden was doing, who was against gay marriage until 2012. At the very worst, even if he's secretly a homophobe or something, just him standing in front of a giant gay pride banner sends a better message than what Joe Biden has been doing.

And also, regarding Elizabeth Warren saying he didn't think a woman could be president, that's just hard to believe when there's video of him telling elementary kids in the 80s that girls could be president. And because he wanted Elizabeth Warren to run in 2016, and the only reason he ran himself was because she didn't. I could see him saying it in the context of something like ""it would be hard for a woman to win against trump because of misogyny.""

Although this is slightly less effective than the combination of Mifepristone and Misoprostol, it is also advised as a safe abortion method by the World Health Organisation.

THAT."
618,"Agreed, FinDom is totally a kink. As long as it is consensual."

621,"I disagree. By shaming kinks that women consensually participate in, you are saying that their choice isn’t valid. Though I agree that gender oppression exists in society, kink shaming women just further oppresses them by restricting their freedom even if it’s in the name of feminism."
622,"Define DDLG please. 

But, you are right about the shaming aspect if this indeed promote such things."
623,">I disagree. By shaming kinks that women consensually participate in, you are saying that their choice isn’t valid.

It's a misogynistic propaganda that any choice a woman makes is legitimate. Choices are not made in a vacuum...they are influenced and shaped by heteropatriarchal teaching. And a significant % of women also happen to be misogynistic. Feminists have absolutely no obligation to support misogynistic women's (small %) misogynistic choices and coerced choices (majority of women) that women are forced to make. The goal of feminism is to dismantle such patriarchal structures so that women don't have to make sure coerced choice. Feminism is not about pleasing heteropatriarchy, it's about dismantling the whole problematic system. And to be honest, I'm not advocating for shaming tactics aimed at women. 
What I'm actually saying is we should shame the male system that enables such situations. 
Maybe you won't appreciate it but heteropatriarchal men and their female enablers have long been trying that same old "" if  feminists do X , it would violet a woman's right"". You will be familiar with conservative Christians arguments that ""liberalisation of laws related to divorce, marriage and domestic violence will violate mothers'/wives' rights "" and ""if we allow women into workforce, women will be less happy ""."
624,"The usual definition is “A relationship between consenting adults, where a parent-child-like relationship occurs.” [Link for reference ](https://thelittlebondageshop.com/ddlg/) since I’m not part of the community for personal reasons and find it a very problematic kink in general since so much time is spent by people within the community explaining how it’s “not like pedophilia”."
625,"I agree with dismantling the heteropatriarchy, the fact that women's choices are made within the context of the society in which they were raised, and that sometimes people use the ""women's rights"" argument improperly. However, if feminism you propose has hard and fast rules about what is ok for women to do and what isn't, who makes those rules? The examples you used about women's happiness and the workforce is very black and white, not all situations are like that. Sometimes the patriarchy has conflicting ideas about how women should act so if you defy one rule you are following another. For example, I am sexually submissive. By being submissive in the bedroom I am giving into the gender roles that women are subservient. But if I don't participate in this kink I have, I'm giving into the patriarchal standard that women shouldn't explore their sexualities and desires. How do I choose?
Furthermore, the feminist movement is heterogenous but normally those with the most power due to race and economic status rise to the forefront of  the conversation. How are a small subgroup of people supposed to make all the rules for all women who have a variety of different experiences? In my opinion, it is best just to educate women on the discrimination they face and the forms of patriarchy that exist and allow them to apply it to their own lives as they choose. I am a feminist and a sexual submissive because I view my kink through a feminist lens, I don't allow men to dominate me in any other part of my life, I accept the risks and responsibility that comes with my kink, and I do it because I want to and I find it empowering."
626,Thank you for the link. Absolutely agree with you that it's utterly problematic. There's no legitimate  reason to tolerate such dehumanizing fetishisation of incestuous behaviour/sexual relationships.
627,">However, if feminism you propose has hard and fast rules about what is ok for women to do and what isn't, who makes those rules? 

Another misogynistic propaganda tactic...you are using here.  It's not okay for an individual woman to do something that will harm other women and marginalised people as a class and that will uphold patriarchal teachings. For example: 

An individual woman don't have any right to be free from criticism when she bats for heteropatriarchal males' propaganda. You have no right to do something that will harm others directly or as a ripple effect. Of course, that's a different matter if your actions are influenced by other oppressive factors (as happens in most situations).

>For example, I am sexually submissive. By being submissive in the bedroom I am giving into the gender roles that women are subservient. But if I don't participate in this kink I have, I'm giving into the patriarchal standard that women shouldn't explore their sexualities and desires.

I'm not interested in your personal sexual lifestyles/experiment (and neither are other actual feminists) and you shouldn't have disclosed these sexual facts about yourself to us without obtaining informed consent from us. You shouldn't impose your kink on me with obtaining my consent. Just  because you are a woman, you don't get to violate other women's boundaries. Another example of things that an individual woman has absolutely no right to do. 

And this post is about money and commodification of women's sexuality, not about individual women who engage in non-commercial sexual submission for her own pleasure. Thus, I absolutely have no idea why you are hell bent on derailing that post. The goal of this post is that commercialization and commodification of women's sexuality, and not the sexuality itself, is a result of heteropatriarchy. 

> I don't allow men to dominate me in any other part of my life, I accept the risks and responsibility that comes with my kink, and I do it because I want to and I find it empowering.

I don't have the physical strength to tolerate such victim blaming. An individual woman (in this situation, you) also don't have any right to victim blame other women. What do you mean you don't let other men to dominate you...are you suggesting that other women LET men to victimize them ? That women themselves are to be blamed for their own victimization? Well...no madam...that's not the case...it's males who are responsible for male violence against women. 

No reply is desired."

Then I thought... Oh duh I should just ask if that is what she wants and if she would appreciate me sending a picture like that to her derp...So I did, I just came out and asked ""would you like to see a picture of me masturbating?"" to which she enthusiastically replied that she absolutely would... so I did and she very much appreciated it.

678,"Yess! You know how many times I've gotten unwanted nudes from women? It happens to me like 3x a day, and they proceed to get really defensive when I call them out on their nasty, toxic behaviour! People out here getting really bold."
679,"yes as a pansexual man I get them all the time, I posted this on my bookface as well and literally people asked if it was an invitation smh"
680,nothing lol I just had no idea which subreddits to put it in so I was like fuck it close enough
681,Your mom's don't count.
682,"That's what this is intended to explain, you should ask for consent before sending someone ur noods... hence the ""Ask them if they want to see the dick."" part"
683,Who's moment? Yours or hers?
684,"It's a chat. Telling if a moment is right or not is even harder than in real life. And why would you ever sext with someone you don't know personally and KNOW that they want to have intercourse with you because they already had it. Also dont send dic pics, once they're out your dong can be all over the internet."
685,Also challenging my ideas=/= offensive or a bad thing ;) we need to challenge ourselves to get better as a society.
686,good point
687,"Thnk you! I am a pansexual non-binary, but I do know there are CIS men out there that get it, good on ya' mate!"
688,Thanks bro
689,Thank you!
690,"It can easily be applied to both genders as it is, but you are absolutely right. As far as sending unwanted pictures, it goes without saying that men have a real problem."
691,Not even step moms?
692,"Oh yeah i agree! I was replying to the ""Did they ask for it? No the chart should end there"" comment"
693,"Sorry what do you mean?

Edit: oh sorry I get it. Ehmm hers right you won't be asking if your moment wasn't right"
694,But that's what a question is for right. I 100% agree with you that sending a dick pic out of the blue is offensive and not ok. About the sexting part I know there a boys who enjoy it and boys who don't and I'm quite certain it's the same for girls. I'm just challenging the you can't even ask part. Like if a conversation is getting heated and spicy then in my opinion it would be okay to ask. What's your opinion in that scenario?
695,Yeah I know but this was not the easiest question to ask without coming off as an ass and not purely out of interest
696,oooo sorry still learning my way around reddit honestly I see that now
697,"Hey OP, do you have a transcript of this podcast available?"

>In Maryland, an order was slightly less clear.....

>As holds on “nonessential” health care began to be rolled out in states across the country last week, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology preempted Republican and anti-abortion governors and attorneys general by issuing a joint statement imploring state governments not to categorize abortion as nonessential."

Also not as new but as important to remember:

Trump appointed judges committed to overturning Roe, reshaped the supreme court through his appointments of Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, and over 100 judges, many of whom have been openly hostile to abortion rights.

He became the first sitting president to speak at the annual March for Life rally — a visible show of support for those who want to restrict abortion access.

He said ""If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that will happen. And that will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.""

He said the overturning of the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe V Wade giving women the right to abortion “will happen, automatically,” if he is elected president and gets to appoint justices to the high court.

713,Pregnancy increases your vulnerability with the virus. So in other words if a medical emergency required an abortion to save your life then these states think you aren’t worth keeping.
714,Isn't the money for all taxpayers who make under 75000?
715,"Also to quote Trump from Sunday ""I don't want to give a bailout to a company and then have somebody go out and use that money to buy back stock in the company and raise the price and then get a bonus. So I may be Republican, but I dont like that. I want them to use the money for the workers."""

Also, no one else is doing this but pro life states. Go figure."
718,Nvmd it's 1.8 trillion with about 500 bill for corporations
719,"There is nothing confirmed yet because rational people are blocking the corporate bailout. Means testing was proposed by the Dems and is really dumb however. The American people need the stimulus now, and we could just increase the taxes of the rich individuals who didn't need the stimulus later.  Putting paperwork on the American people during a crisis is silly."
720,"Or you can have both your mom and dad walk you down the isle as a sign of their support for the marriage and have the officiant who is marrying you say ""Who supports this marriage""?  Rather than ""who gives away the bride"".  Or not have them walk you down at all.  There really isn't any rules that you have to follow.  I mean, wearing white is supposed to symbolize purity and virginity.  A lot of things in a wedding are based on outmoded patriarchal traditions.  You can change the meaning of them in any way you choose."
721,We had some friends who got married and walked down the isle together hand in hand! It was very sweet.
722,"I had a slightly unconventional wedding when I was a little on the older side, and my partner and I struggled to decide what we wanted to include. We realized that, while our wedding was about our relationship, it was also a really important day for other people in our family...and there were a loooooot of feelings / dynamics to manage. 

Side note: when I was younger, my original plan was to elope. As I got older, I realized how I’d rob my mom and dad (who I really love) of an experience that they had been looking forward to my whole life. I’m also an only child so it would have been extra rough.

One of the things that helped us was to think about the goals of our wedding. For us, we wanted our guests to have a blast and for it to be meaningful to us. So we put money towards things that would do that like transport to and from the venue (so people could drink without worrying). We skipped on other things like the expensive dress.

Another was to have honest conversations with people who were most important to us about what was really important to them. For my mom, it was dress shopping (and getting real flowers) and for my dad, it was being there and the father daughter dance. 

A last one was to give ourselves permission to reinvent and skip on certain traditions. Garter toss? Skip. Gross. Bouquet toss? Skip. Choosing favorites between nieces and nephews to pick a flower girl and ring bearer? Let them opt into doing a “parade”.

My approach to the aisle question was to have both my (divorced) parents walk me down the aisle. But is there a very different alternative that you can do? Have the groom walk you? Already be at the alter when the guests come in? Ride in on a horse? Do a dance down the aisle with your dad? Could he be your officiant so he can’t walk you down the aisle?

Planning our wedding was a royal pain, but my wedding was one of my favorite days. Good luck with this tough decision. Fingers crossed that you can think of something awesome."
723,"It's your wedding, your rules. (I mean the collective 'your' here - yours and your fiancé's.) You are under no obligation to abide by traditions.

Whose heart are you worried about breaking, your father or your fiancé? (I assume it's your father but it's syntactically unclear.) Either way, they should be more worried about breaking your heart by forcing you into a tradition you see as belittling during your own wedding. You're not being radical, this is a totally fine thing to want. Talk to them."
724,"I got past it by having a courthouse wedding. No aisle to walk down. That wasn’t why we made that choice, but it worked out nicely given I wouldn’t have wanted my father (or anyone honestly) to give me away"
725,"I have two brothers and they were both ushers at my wedding. After they seated the guests and the wedding party made their entrance, my brothers simply walked me down the aisle too. I do remember I had to adamantly repeat to our elderly male officiant that I wanted to completely omit the “who gives this woman” bit and he really didn’t seem to understand why. No matter how many times I explained it, he just kept trying to reword it and force us to do it. It was the only time in the wedding planning process I raised my voice at someone."
726,"My husband and I walked to the front alone. My dad wasn’t offended at all, he was very supportive of my view that it was archaic and misogynistic. I was fortunate to escape drama regarding it but people were definitely surprised when we walked together!"
727,"If your mom is still around and you're close to both of your parents, why not have them both walk you down? You can make sure that there's no weird language part of the ceremony like ""who gives this woman"" etc. To me it's more like your parents are supporting you as you enter a new phase of your life, which is sweet. It's also a way to show how important your parents are to you - assuming this is the case, because some people do have really shit parents."
728,"Right there with you. I kept some traditions in my wedding, but did away with this one. I walked by myself."
729,"I agree with your  point of view,but I am doing it for my dad. My dad told me from when I was little he thought about walking me down the aisle. He told me he was excited to be the last person to walk beside me before I started a new path in my life. So that is how I look at it; he is not giving me away, but rather he is walking beside me. Also I think about how happy he will be to do this, it means a lot to him... so much more than it means to me to be against it."
730,"You could ask him if he's ok with not walking you down the aisle because it bothers you. When my sister got married no one gave her away, my dad was fine with it. My mom got mad  for about 5 minutes though."
731,"I don’t know what your family set ups are but could you do something like you both walk down the aisle, both flanked by both of your parents?"
732,"If you have both parents, just have your family send you off as a group!"
733,I walked with both my parents!
734,"Thank you all, hearing your stories has brought me clarity and support. ❤"
735,I honestly thought the dad walking you down the aisle meant he gave your marriage his blessing and he supports it🤷🏽‍♀️. And if he refuses he doesn’t support it. Idk I think you should allow your dad to walk you down the aisle as although we like to think marriage is all about the bridegroom it’s also about 2 families coming together
736,I would want that too! I think it's much more romantic than the traditional version!
737,That's how we almost always do it in Sweden :)
738,That's what I wanted too!
739,Yes I suppose I'm worried about the judgement I'll receive from my less liberal family members. Thank you. ❤
740,There's no reason it should be dad only. Absolutely no reason.
741,That's really great!
742,She asked about her dad that why I said dad she can literally have anyone walk her down the aisle but she was concerned with dad her wedding her choice at the end of the day 🤷🏽‍♀️
743,"Sure, but she's talking about her dad because that's the tradition. The tradition is to have dad walk you down the aisle. It's an outdated tradition. That's what I mean when I say there's no reason it should be dad only."
744,"I loved her as a character when I read that book. She's described as attractive or pretty, she is poor and is mistreated many times but still she grows and shows an incredible kind of dignity, will power and inner strength that is extremely refreshing to see in a female character. 

Definitely a role model, and a book worth reading, for men *and* women"
745,"Not teaching boys how to do basic adulting is bad for everyone. When I first got together with my husband, he couldn't cook or do laundry and barely knew how to clean. It was ridiculous. I didn't want a child or a project, so we worked together to get him up to speed. Men can use the internet and research how to do these basic chores. They can handle the responsibility. Many simply choose not to, and other men and women enable them.

There is no bigger turn off than learned helplessness."
746,Wish my mom was like that with my brother
747,"My husband went to boarding school so he just... Never learned how to do anything around the house, because he was never taught. (We started dating while he was living in university dorms so he really never learned a thing before I can along.) Thankfully he agrees with an equal divide but trying to get him to be as aware of what needs to be done or all the facets of a job (right now it's 'yes you need to sanitize the sink when you're cleaning the kitchen it gets dirty too') I love my M/FIL but am a bit irritated that they never took the time to teach him a single thing. 

Although to be fair, he was never taught any traditionally 'male sphere' things either so I'm also teaching him to take care of our cars and whatnot. Poor boy. At least he's trying."
748,"Wish my in-laws had taught my husband how to take care of himself instead of giving him the idea it’s a “wife’s job” to take care of him. He’s miles better now, but the first couple years of co-hab were ROUGH, let me tell ya."
749,[removed]
750,"My brother gets away with living in filth and doing nothing for our family. It was only when I decided to stop doing the chores in protest that my parents realized how unfair it was that I had to do so much work in the house while he did nothing.

He's supposed to follow a strict chore schedule but he still barely ever does his part. Why are they given a pass for this"
751,"School systems don’t teach any life skills (which is one of there biggest problems) much less do they teach equality, so props to you for helping your husband and props to him for being on board with it. It sounds like you are just what he needed in his life."
752,"My 60 year old husband has been with me for 13 years. I put things in the same place, every single time. Even in the fridge. It if came from THAT spot, it goes back in THAT spot. He creates a new spot for things daily. It drives me NUTS. He told me he likes doing dishes as his hands get clean (he is a mechanic-don’t get me started on his tools vs mine (dad was a meticulous machinist, so mine a neat AF). He leaves grease on ALL plastic. He can’t stack them in order in the drainer, or in the cabinet. He just piles them one on top of the other...so the drain is about 1/3 filled and he stops. If you stack them using the dividers, they will all fit. Nope. I have to practice patience and just refashion and restock the cabinet, refill towels. I no longer gently remind, I just fix it. My fridge? Lost cause. Lol."
753,I think pedants are seriously missing the point here. We put violent gory bloody movie scenes on blast everywhere but the mere mention of menstrual blood makes people gag. Don't take it so literally.
754,"Reminds me of the classic book “blood bread and roses” by Judy Grahn:

Menstrual blood is the only source of blood that is not traumatically induced. Yet in modern society, this is the most hidden blood, the one so rarely spoken of and almost never seen, except privately by women, who shut themselves in a little room to quickly and in many cases disgustedly change their pads and tampons, wrapping the bloodied cotton so it won't be seen by others, wrinkling their faces at the odor, flushing or hiding the evidence away. Blood is everywhere, and yet the one, the only, the single name it has not publicly had for many centuries, is menstrual blood. Menstrual blood, like water, just flows. Its fountain existed long before knives or flint; menstruation is the original source of blood.

Menstrual is blood's secret name. All blood is menstrual blood."
755,"Tautoko (support) this. In Te Ao Maaori (the maaori world) we're trying hard to decolonise the patriarchal and disrespectful views that western society has enforced on us as natives and as women. Before european settlers showed up, waiwhero (period blood) was seen by everyone as a sacred and natural gift. It was a gift from Papatuuaanuku, the earth our mother. There was no shame in getting your period, there was celebration. Grandmothers would guide and explain to their mokopuna (grandchildren) what the gift meant, and guide them through their first bleeding. Proud fathers and grandfathers were directly involved in caring during this process as well. The blood was considered to be a potent spiritual force, because it came from the womb which bridged between the mortal and spiritual realm. If a man disrespected a womans womb, it was a crime- and his punishment was to eat a lizard (which carried disease and were seen as omens of death) or be fought to the death. 
Now women expect to be ridiculed if someone discovers they're menstruating."

787,"“Tenure track” in Italy is an unattainable dream for most postgrads, what with elderly professors squatting on their position without even bothering to show up anymore (they still get their names on papers authored by their minions because of course) and scores of TAs who are still in precarious employment in their 50s and still waiting for their chance at the old crow’s office."

792,"I think about it everyday. When ppl see men with armpit hair they dont care, but when there are stubbles under a womans armpit ppl freak tf out. Hair is as normal for women as it is for men, so why tf is it disgusting on them?"
793,"I’m comfortable with having unshaved legs and armpits most of the time, but for some reason I’m self conscious about it at work. Maybe I’m afraid I will be judged as unprofessional?

Edit: typo"
794,"I don't shave, and most of the time I am super comfortable with it. But there are definitely times I fell ashamed, more so about my legs than my pits? I generally just try to brush it off, but that internalized sexism runs deep!"
795,A friend once told me he knows he’s straight because he’s not attracted to body hair. I quickly pointed out the fallacy in his thinking.
796,I don't shave my legs regularly. My fiance has not complained so far & we've been together nearly 6 years.
797,"I don't prefer men with body hair, personally. That's just a preference though and ultimately is no dealbreaker."
798,"I have sensitive skin and razors are expensive. I decided to stop shaving, because I realized it was a ton of work and money for something I really didn't care about.

I haven't shaved my legs in about 5 years, and literally no one but my husband can even tell."

Like...that is surely NOT what the surgical team should have been focussing on, right? Even now, JUST as the pain is -slightly not so bad I feel the need to apologise for being just too plain exhausted to worry about what my legs look like over how they're, y'know, actually -functioning-?"
801,"I have bad (and visible) eczema on my legs so no way in hell am I going to shave/wax my legs and end up with painful, weeping rashes. Anyone who calls me out on that seriously has problems with their priorities."
802,"I feel like most men I’ve been intimate with as an adult could not care less if I shaved my legs or not. I don’t do it near as often as I used to. 

You get the added bonus of them noticing when you do it and getting excited. But otherwise, they never care at all. They know we’re busy, it’s silly, and has no real downsides."
803,"About 8 months ago I saw online “I’ve seen more women with self-harm scars then leg hair” and it blew my mind. As someone with self-harm scars I said “fuck it” and stopped shaving my legs too. I never really have anxiety about my scars or tattoos as I’ve long accepted them, but I still get nervous about my leg hairs - which is stupid as one is natural and the others are not. I DO like the feeling of my little hairs in the wind, it’s a new sensation. And while it shouldn’t make a difference, I’m lucky to have a boyfriend that couldn’t care less and understands the point I’m trying to make - and his support helps."
804,"I don’t think most men care to have their “preferences” challenged, and most women start shaving at a young age due to social pressure. All you can really do is talk to people about it and hope you can plant seeds."
805,"I don't shave my legs. I have light blonde hair on my legs & so it's not noticeable except super up close. I've been shamed for it by my mother & sister, calling it ""embarrassing"" & ""gross"". I don't understand what's ""gross"" about it."
806,"I stopped shaving my legs a long time ago, but my armpit hair tends to get a little long for comfort, so I tend to shave that."
807,I’m comfortable with not shaving my legs—in fact I regularly don’t during the week :) but I get cold easily so I usually wear tights at work anyways. I do shave on the weekends because I LOVE the way soft smooth legs feel and the way my blankets and jeans feel on my legs!! It’s a self care fun thing for me. My boyfriend also likes when they’re soft and smooth but he gets that I don’t always have time to shave too.
808,"I stopped shaving my legs/pits in highschool. Not only is it super taxing and takes so much of my time, its itchy and uncomfortable. To me, I think it's better to know up front who wouldn't approve. People who would worry about the superficial choices of another person aren't the kind of people I want in my life. Whatever you want to do with your body is your business, and whatever I do with mine is my business, I'd rather know who wouldn't respect my choices based on what they think people are ""supposed to do"""
809,Theres nothing more feminine then natural body hair. Anyone who thinks otherwise has been brainwashed through societal conditioning. Sadly that's most people.
810,"Yeah I get it, I don't like the pressure of having to shave arms legs and armpits, but I do it anyway because my skin is so soft that I'm kind of addicted to touch it"
811,"Yeah it may be that. But for some men and women, they just like the feeling of smooth, hairless skin. All in all it should be accepted to go both ways if you're a man or a woman, and not be disgusting to have body hair. For example I'm a girl but I remove my unwanted body hair for myself to feel good, because I like having smooth skin. But it's not in anyway to please men and they need to stop thinking they can tell us what to do with our bodies."
812,"I let all my body hair grow out for 5 months just to challenge my feelings on it and what my actual preferences were when I wasn't following the norm.

For me I don't like the way long leg hair feels so I've decided to shave every few weeks to keep it on the shorter side (stubble is fine to me). Similar with armpit hair - it doesn't bother me until it gets too long (and then it pinches - how to men deal with that?!). And I discovered I kind of liked the look of armpit hair after a few weeks of growth. I've always had a I-do-what-I-want relationship with pubic hair so nothing really changed there.

It was overall a really valuable exercise. I have a feeling my preferences might still be influenced a bit by culture but I definitely feel more in control of how I decided to present myself in terms of my body hair. So I highly recommend for others to try."
813,"As disturbing as it is, I suspect that in large part this toxic expectation is in place because of an association with prepubescent girls. Hair is often associated with maturity, and therefore many (typically cishet) men idealize and sexualize women with little to no body hair, and on the flip side men with less hair are typically viewed by much of society as less attractive. Regardless the whole thing is really odd to me and I really don't understand why so many people think it's okay to shame anyone for the presence of hair, or lack thereof."
814,I rarely shave my armpits. The hair grows and I don't care because I tend to get eczema flare ups there and when I have a flare shaving hurts. Lately I have an electric shaver for my legs I'm a tad obsessed with it but I went like 3 years without shaving before I got this shaver. But the shaver doesn't shave super close I do have stubblies but not anything that you can really see but you can feel them
815,"Hair on other people doesn't bother me, but I don't like my own body hair. I already feel like a bloated, balding yeti."
816,"I don't shave my underarms anymore, only trim the hair when I'm feelin it. My elderly aunt told me she thought it was gross but would do it herself if it weren't for the ""stink"". That's not how it works auntie. That's not how any of this works."
817,I stopped shaving this past winter. Every so often I’ll shave my pits but I still can’t bring myself to shave my legs. My husband thinks it’s funny 🤷🏻‍♀️
818,"It’s only because we’re used to it. We grow up surrounded mostly by women who shave and the media almost never shows female body hair (and when they do it’s normally presented as something gross). In the Victorian era and earlier women didn’t shave anything and it was normal. It was once women started wearing stockings and shorter skirts and shorter sleeves that razor companies decided to target women to expand their profits. They pushed the idea that a real lady was neat and tidy if she had no body hair on display. It actually took a long time for leg shaving to even catch on cuz women preferred just wearing stockings instead. What a con.
In books I’ve read from the early 1900s there are male authors describing women’s bushes as a beautiful, sexy, mysterious sight. They hadn’t been influenced by porn filled with hairless women yet. There is nothing inherently off-putting about body hair - we are conditioned to see it that way. 

This article gives a good history of why it became a thing:

819,corporations needed to find a way to sell razors to women
820,"My dad once asked me when I was about 11 or 12 if I would shave my legs once I became a young adult. I specifically remember telling him “Probably not” and he asked why. I told him that “It looks like a lot of work and I don’t care what boys think about my leg hair”. He encouraged me to shave them anyway because it’s “Just what young women are expected to do” When I was around 15 I started to shave my legs but as a 19 year old woman, I can say I have shaved my legs less that 10 times in the last 2 years. I feel very comfortable with my natural body hair and I hate the feeling of freshly shaven legs. I do try to keep my armpits shaved, though, as that is just my personal preference."
821,"Check out this song!

822,"I wonder this too. I have full understanding of the concept, but I can't bring myself to be cool with my leg hair yet. I've also been wondering how to get rid of this mindset. It's so weird too, because I'm old enough to remember the 80's, vaguely. I was very young, but all my aunts had non shaved legs, older ladies never shaved. Women everywhere had arpit hair. So wasn't till my pree teen / teen years shaving was a thing around me. It's curious."
823,"I don’t even wanna talk about where my hair grows, my legs are the least of my worries! I shave my “cactus leg” when I notice myself petting it like a weirdo, but I’m fairly certain my husband doesn’t care in the slightest."
824,"Conditioning by society. The patriarchy of society.

We're mammals and it's normal to have body hair and in other places on our faces. But we're shamed for it."
825,"I shave my legs because I like how it looks, however I respect if a woman don’t like to shave her legs and I think that looks nice too."
826,There’s this obsession with youth when it comes to women. I was reading “The Purity Myth” by Jessica Valenti and she talks about how the virginity movement doesn’t want women to be women but to be girls. Young and innocent. So I think that’s where it stems from. So hairless bodies is equated with youth I suppose. I don’t know. Just my take on it
827,"I shave and all my gfs laser’d their hair. 

I’m all for girls wanting to go all natural but I love how my skin feels after I shave personally."
828,"I have ocd and would obsessively stress when I missed a spot after shaving (which was always). So I stopped shaving for a long time. Maybe a year and a few months. Now I shave when I feel like it, because I love the feeling of being freshly shaved. It’s totally changed how I view shaving. Definitely recommend."
829,"I dont shave my legs or armpits. Ive dated multiple men since and not one of them cared. They werent all the same ""type"" of guy and none of them had prior experience with a woman with body hair. My hairs light and im not the hairiest but everyone was nice, one guy was initially alarmed that i ""forgot"" to shave my legs before I let him touch them. Pretty cute.

Sadly, most judgement and stares come from other women."
830,"My leg hair is very thick and wiry, and when it starts growing out it's itchy, and maddening. I'd go for laser removal, but it's... costly."
831,I don’t shave my legs. Going fluffy feels really nice and losing the blades has given me extra $$ haha
832,I always wonder how this became a social norm. Like where’d it start
833,"I stopped shaving my legs a few years ago because it felt like such a chore. I was bitching about it and my husband asked why I did it. Which totally blue screened my brain because I realized I did it for him but he didn't care if I did it or not. Which I explained, it was for him. He then said he truly didn't care and don't do it if I don't want to. Which felt crazy weird at first, especially because it's hot where we live and I wear shorts and sandals 9 months out of the year. It's been maybe 6 years now and no one has ever said anything. Now, I can't say that anyone hasn't noticed, just that they haven't said anything. And there is still that voice at the back of my head telling me that maybe I should be doing it because that's what seems ""normal"". It's what I've been told for years was the requirement. In fact, the only people who have made comments about it have been my fathers. They are completely disgusted and tell me all the time how gross and unattractive it is. Which seems even weirder because my husband doesn't care so why do they care so much about how their daughter doesn't shave."
834,"I like smooth legs instead of stubble but stubble on a guy or hair on a guys legs, I’m fine with.  It’s been on my mind too lately every time I shave"
835,"I have blonde leg hair but darker armpit hair. I have no issues letting my leg hair grow out to the point that it’s super noticeable to the touch, but still not easy to see. But my armpits I won’t go more than a couple days between shaving. 

I think whatever is engrained in me is a sight thing, and I’m just so curious as to what the distinction in my mind is that makes it okay."
836,"as i've grown older, i've been more okay with my leg hair, although it's blonde. 

i do get paranoid over my eyebrows b/c i don't groom them regularly. 

i'm okay with not wearing makeup and i've been lucky not to be admonished for it."
837,I don't mind body hair on women especially if it's soft instead of prickly. I imagine women will stop shaving their legs the day that men stop shaving their faces.
838,"From my older brother: Its a sign of masculinity (Really stupid if you ask me). When he said that, he made me feel so dysphoric I just wanted to die"
839,"I stopped removing all body hair this summer, and I found that no one gives a fuck. One guy gave me a weird look at work (or more like a confused double take) and my sister cracked up laughing when we were trying on clothes one time but that's it! People either don't notice or are polite enough not to mention it. And depending on where it is my partner is either indifferent or finds it a turn on.

I'm saving so. much. time. and reducing plastic waste so it's really a win-win for me"
840,"I don't shave my legs and armpits anymore. I haven't done it in months. My fiance doesn't mind at all. He has more hair than I do anyway.


To be honest, I don't know if I'll be brave enough to not do it when summer comes, so there's that..."
841,If this isn’t me
842,Does anyone else find they sweat more when they have armpit hair? I noticed that about myself and that's the only reason I do it.
843,"I only ever shave my legs if I’m going to be wearing shorts or a swimsuit... so basically if I’m going on holiday. Even then I hate doing it, but my leg hair is really dark and gets quite long so it’s really noticeable and I don’t want to deal with looks or comments or risking making my family feel embarrassed. I wish it was just an accepted thing, because my leg hair BEFORE I ever started shaving was fine and blonde, and I could have gotten away with never doing it. Sigh."
844,"The rule of thumb that I follow is that only the person themselves can decide whether on not they want body hair. I despise body hair and hence I shave often and regularly, but that only applies to me - other women probably don't have the same harsh feelings towards body hair and thus shouldn't feel like they have to shave! It should be entirely their own decision"
845,"Transfem/enby here, body/facial hair is one of my main sources of physical dysphoria.

I hate my leg hair, but it's a lot of effort to maintain. Have tried a few different methods, may look at laser in future. Considering going on hormones which may also help.

I've started laser on my facial hair and that's going well so far, if weirdly patchy.

Arm hair I can usually ignore because I don't really see it, but when I do it bothers me a little.

Pubic hair I find gross and will trim with clippers, wet shave or use nair/veet."
846,I’m trying to make peace with my body hair. I would wax every four weeks. I think it’s hard when you’re fat/not conventionally attractive bc it’s just....one more thing.
847,"Oddly enough, the only people who not only ever noticed my leg hair and were bothered by it were other women."
848,I find male leg hair disgusting too... armpit hair too
849,[removed]
850,"I think all human beings should shave their armpit and leg hair. It's gross. I don't know I find it gross but I have a visceral response to people with hair other than their heads. That includes chest and abdomen as well.

With that being said I don't care about facial hair for both men and women.

**EDIT: ""I think"" merely indicates my preference. I couldn't think of ""preference"" so that's the best my brain could come up with at that time. I don't by any means think everyone should follow my opinion on body hair as the standard.**"
851,[removed]
852,"I remember seeing this absolutely stunning girl.  Her hair had so much volume.  She could have been in a shampoo commercial.  She was wearing capris and and she had the thickest, blackest hair on her legs and it actually made me feel queasy, like I was going to throw up.  It was an involuntary reaction.  Uhg, I'm so pathetic.  I'm the most progressive liberal guy about everything but somewhere deep in my lizard brain hair on legs = yuck and there's nothing I can do about it."
853,[removed]
854,"I had to shave my armpits when my kids were small, because we'd take them to the pool for family swim and the other parents would stare. Put people in warm water and they kind of zone out. It was creepy.

It certainly doesn't bother my husband, and I've got stuff to do so I don't worry about it. If someone wants to cast me in a play, I promise I will shave my pits to avoid upsetting the audience."
855,"I was homeschooled as a kid which was good for its own reasons but terrible during puberty. I had never in my life seen a women’s leg with hair, along with armpits with hair. 

When I was 12/13 it started growing, (long, fine, definitely noticeable) and I was in complete and utter shame of my tall and skinny hair body. I didn’t know what was happening and why (people didn’t talk about this on YouTube back then).

All I know is that I felt ashamed. As a kid. Because I wasn’t shown or taught that that was normal. My mother never showed her legs or her arms so I had no sense of normalcy. 

I remember wearing a tee shirt under my volleyball jersey because of my armpit hair shame. I couldn’t tell if the other girls were natural or shaven and I was much too embarrassed to ask. I didn’t even know they made razors for women at all. 

Anyways. I’m a fully fine and functioning adult now, but I still would never let my future daughter go through what I did at those ages. I’m going to teach her and show her the nature that is a woman’s body. Something my mother was always too afraid to do."
856,"It's so absurd to me that women are pressured into shaving their legs and armpits, and even arms if they their hair is ""too dark"". My wife doesnt shave her armpits or legs anymore, and I don't even notice. It must be such a fucking hassle to cut all that hair, all the time. I hate having to shave my beard so I only do it every couple weeks. And that's only because I'll start to get pimples and dry itchy skin if I have it for too long. Leg and armpit hair doesnt cause that on anyone that I've ever heard of, so there isnt even a real practical reason to do it. I guess men just like women to look like little kids instead of grown ass adults. Some really deeply seeded pedo culture if you ask me."
857,I've struggled with this too! Same with makeup. I don't like wearing it every goddamn day but if I go to work without I feel like it'll be looked at as me being sloppy. These pressures to fit into the lady-shaped mould come from everywhere!
858,"It's unfortunate but very true that it's still considered ""unprofessional"" in many settings for women to not adhere to special grooming practices like shaving themselves bald, save for their heads and eyebrows. :("
859,I shave my armpits because it makes them less stinky
860,To be fair you don't see men's hairy armpits in the office either.
861,"Same, I don't shave my pits at all anymore and I have zero shame about it, but I hate my leg hair. I think it's a mix of sexism and also just a desire to have slippery legs. I like slippery legs, it makes me feel sexy."
862,"Same! I do shave my pits, but for my own comfort. Stopped shaving my legs quite some time ago, but still I often feel self-conscious about it in public. Especially if you see another girl staring at your legs"
863,I shave my legs because when I wear certain leggings my hair will stick to the material and it’s really irritating and sometimes when I sleep it does the same thing. But I could never wear a dress or a bathing suit without shaved legs and it sucks that I can’t just be brave and say “fuck irl but oh well
864,"Wow, this is a really messed up mindset in my opinion."
865,"i’ve been with my boyfriend for over 2 years, and he doesn’t care about my unshaved legs (haven’t shaved in like 5 months at least) or armpits (i shave them about once every six weeks or so for personal preference). it’s pretty great"
866,[removed]
867,"I know what you mean! Despite how I feel about my body hair in public (ashamed, due to social conditioning) lately I have been feeling oddly proud and feminine when I look at my own body hair in the mirror. It makes me feel in tune with my body, and despite society saying it's not feminine, I have come to understand it as a beautiful product of female puberty. My hormones gave me this. Body hair is a sign that I'm an adult woman."
868,"I let mine grow once. They were definitely sweatier and smellier. It is how it works, the hair traps the sweat rather than it just drying. I've always shaved since."
869,"I notice this, but I don't know if it's that I actually sweat more or just that the hair is causing me to notice the sweat."
870,The same reason why other guys make fun of guys with small penises probably.
871,There is a difference between a preference and thinking everyone needs to adhere to your standards.
872,"Hi! It's not deep in your lizard brain at all, shaving as a mandatory practice for women only became popular in the mid twentieth century (although humans have been practising various forms of hair removal for millenia) :) You absolutely can do something about it!"
873,Biologically in mammals body’s hair is a sign of maturity.
874,"Why?, I don’t understand your idea. Can you explain me?"
875,[removed]
876,"I feel like if you're consistent, then it's just what people expect of you. I'm privileged to have the kind of job where it doesn't matter how I look, beyond needing to wear business casual clothes. I refuse to put more work into my appearance than a standard man would. I don't do makeup, I don't pluck eyebrows, I don't shave my legs. I brush my hair and teeth, and put appropriate clothes on. 

Plus side, looking bomb when you do decide to break out the makeup."
877,"Maybe it's because if you're wearing it everyday, people will expect to see you with it rather than without it. I never wear makeup unless there is a special occasion and I guess because people are so used to seeing me without it, I've never had anyone comment that I look sick or dull.

Try going a whole week without it and then extend that to another week or two...you could eventually just phase it out."
878,"Pants, sleeves? Those make me comfortable and it's professional not to show too much skin, plus conceals your shaving habits or lack thereof."
879,I do not shave my arm pits because it makes them less stinky! It’s always interesting to me how bodies are so individual
880,Same and honestly I wish men would shave theirs. I genuinely am smellier if I let them grow. Think how much nicer men would smell if they just realised it's cleaner and shaved them.
881,Smooth legs on new sheets is the best feeling.
882,Maybe they stare because they admire your courage? I wear pants almost exclusively but if a lady wants to wear shorts or skirts that's her business.
883,"1. People are attracted to fat people. 

2. Attraction can evolve and change over time. For instance, I no longer find teenagers attractive, but I definitely found them attractive when I was a teen. I used to have rigid tastes and now I find damn near anyone attractive, especially if I’m given the opportunity to get to know them. Additionally, my attraction dies quicker than light speed if someone starts spewing bigoted, ignorant ideas no matter how beautiful their wrapping is."
884,"Exactly how I feel!


I shaved all of my body for SO many years that I never even realized how it warped my mind. Eventually I didnt shave for a while and when I looked in the mirror one day I just thought ""woah, that's an actual adult womans body""."
885,"Of course. I don't mean otherwise. I can see how my statement comes off as ""everyone needs to adhere to my standards"" because of my usage of the phrase ""I think"" but I meant it to indicate a preference. 

Thanks for correcting me, I'll clarify my comment."
886,[removed]
887,"What I mean by ""deeply seeded pedo culture"" is that we do these things for no reason at all. Its so normalized we dont think twice about why this became a standard in the first place. In no way am trying to say that all men who expect this standard from women are pedophiles, not at all. I just think there have been generations and generations of powerfull men who were pedophiles, who cultivated pedophilia, who passed that down over generations which led to powerful men in the industry of fashon, makeup, etc, to build a standard for women without even realizing they just like to see skinny little hairless bodies, creating a standard that everybody else follows without a second though, to the point that women just feel compelled to shave their hair for no reason at all.

If you feel weird about a women with hairy legs or pits, I'm not saying you're a pedo. I'm saying that you are victim of systemic social construction and toxic masculinity, just like me and every other man. And we all have our ways of dealing with that. So I'm not trying to play ""better than thou""."
888,">Plus side, looking bomb when you do decide to break out the makeup.

This is true. I recently stopped wearing mascara daily (small victories) and it's really nice to be able to kick it up a notch for special occasions rather than always wearing a full face of makeup."
889,"This is exactly it. In high school one of my friends wore makeup every day, then one day she came in without it and everyone told her she looked horrible and kept asking if she was sick. Seeing that turned me off of make up daily. I do put some on for special occasions but even then I only do eyeliner and lipstick."
890,"Idk how relatable this is, but I love shaving my legs and then going into the ocean. I feel like a slippery eel. A sexy slippery eel"
891,"Oh wow, that's such a great outlook! Thanks!"
892,[removed]
893,"But the beauty standards change through the evolution of society, isn’t?"
894,Of course people can. Look back through history at all the wild and diverse things that were considered attractive for both men and women. There is certainly very little consistency in what people find attractive in the opposite sex. Sexual preferences are not innate; they're learned through sociocultural norms.
895,yo this is so true
896,[removed]
897,Not to mention the money and time you save not doing full makeup every day.
898,"Ever since you've phased it out, do people still ask you if you are sick?"
899,"Damn that’s so judgmental. I never learned how to do makeup so it’s normal for me to be fresh faced. Only sometimes do I put on mascara and that’s literally it. I’m not against makeup, I think a lot of women see it as art, and a lot of women find it fun to wear and put on but I have no desire to get into makeup like that"
900,Yeah. Staring's not necessarily because they have a negative view. I try not to read too much in other people's actions like that unless they specifically verbally state something.
901,"This is absolutely untrue, where did you read it? There is a lot of research that shows that cultural norms and our first sexual experiences strongly shape our sexual preferences. We're not born with any sexual preferences - how would that even be possible considering the vast range of body types, styles of dress, and other techniques to attract a mate that have been popular throughout human history? Sexual orientation is innate; sexual preferences are learned."
902,"Lol ok. I mean, I did, when I realised that I had some super shitty views. People evolve and change, whether they choose to or not."
903,"But you can decide how to deal with your ""preferences.""

Such as, choosing not to care whether or not someone shaves her legs because it's none of your business."
904,[removed]
905,"That's ok. I feel sorry for you, too."

913,"You are not attracted to body hair because that’s what’s you have seen growing up, that’s the ideal that’s been pushed. You can’t say you are attracted to that because you were born being attracted to that, that’s just silly. You’re attracted to shaved legs/armpits? Fine. But understand and realised that your attraction is because of current beauty standards. Beauty standards change, societal pressure changes, attraction changes. Accept that and move on. No ones asking you to change your preferences per say, just understand why you have them and don’t expect women to stick to your preference just because that’s what you find attractive."

919,"If you think that beauty standards are a fixed and stationary thing you need to have a long hard look at history and the changing of women’s (and men’s) bodies throughout those times. Standards/attractions change, they have always changed and they will continue to change. You cannot say that all men must and do think the same things you do just because you are a man. I cannot say definitively what other women are attached to just because I am a women. You are allowed to have your preference, but don’t pretend to speak for all men and don’t tell women who don’t meet your expectations that they, their choices or their bodies are ‘UGLY’. Thanks."
920,"Women started shaving in the 1900's. Are you suggesting that not a single man found any women attractive before then? Also, you're literally mansplaining and you tell them to stop ""womansplaining"" lmao. I'm a man, btw, so don't try to tell me that I don't know what male attraction is"
921,I'd prefer that you don't judge women for having perfectly normal body hair.
922,"You were trying to trigger me by suggesting I was sexually molested as a child, or something to that extent, which is a really shitty/trollish thing to do. You dont seem to want to understand my point of view, you want to shame me for point of view. Maybe because it makes you feel threatened? You continue to say that I believe all men are pedophiles, but you didnt really read the comment I made that stated that that is absolutely not the case. You just want to prove you are right and I'm wrong, instead of accepting that I have a different opinion than you. In my humble opinion, your behavior is the problem. So I think I'm going to make a choice to not interact with you anymore."

It's actually even worse, on the national level women got to vote in 1971, in the regional election, the last region to grant women voting rights did so in 1991, because they were pressured by the government.

Gonna share the important info that the uploader added to the description here:

#No modifier will suffice to describe what a terrible, diabolical ""female enslavement"" incident that happened.

#In this unprecedented incident, instead of repenting from the Jung Joon-young group chat incident, these dirty people took ""precaution"" by using an anonymous SNS application, ""Telegram"", where they thought they could get away with turning a number of girls and women into sexual slaves.

#Three surprising responses appeared on male-dominant sites:
#""groveling for links"", concern for their own safety for having watched them, and ridiculing ""voluntary prostitution""-""cunt-selling"".

#That's right. Not one person told women about this.
#That is for over half a year.

#If women aren't awake, the society will not change.

#When the petition expires, please keep sharing the new link for the petition.**

946,"It might be related to the historical gendered division of labor.

>The gender division of labor varies significantly across societies. In some cultures women actively
participate in employment outside of the home, while in others there is a clear specialization of
tasks along gender lines: women tend to remain within the home and do not participate in
activities outside of the domestic sphere. These differences are most clearly illustrated by the vast
differences in female labor force participation (FLFP), which in 2000 ranged from 16.1% (Pakistan)
to 90.5% (Burundi).

***


>This study tests the hypothesis, originally put forth by Ester Boserup (1970), that gender role
differences have their origins in different forms of agriculture practiced traditionally. In particular,
Boserup identifies important differences between shifting cultivation and plough cultivation.
Shifting cultivation, which uses hand-held tools like the hoe and the digging stick, is labor
intensive and women actively participate in farm-work. Plough cultivation, by contrast, is much
more capital intensive, using the plough to prepare the soil. Unlike the hoe or digging stick,
the plough requires significant upper body strength, grip strength, and burst of power, which are
needed to either pull the plough or control the animal that pulls it. Because of these requirements,
when plough agriculture is practiced, men have an advantage in farming relative to women
(Murdock and Provost, 1973).3 Also reinforcing this gender-bias in ability is the fact that when the
plough is used, there is less need for weeding, a task typically undertaken by women and children
(Foster and Rosenzweig, 1996). In addition, child care, a task almost universally performed by
women, is most compatible with activities that can be stopped and resumed easily and do not put children in danger. These are characteristics that are satisfied for hoe agriculture, but not for
plough agriculture, particularly since large animals are typically used to pull the plough.
The result, according to Boserup, is that societies that traditionally practiced plough agriculture
– rather than shifting cultivation – developed a specialization of production along gender lines.
Men tended to work outside of the home in the fields, while women specialized in activities
within the home.4 This division of labor then generated norms about the appropriate role of
women in society. Societies characterized by plough agriculture, and a resulting gender-based
division of labor, developed the belief that the natural place for women is within the home.
These cultural beliefs tend to persist even if the economy moves out of agriculture, affecting the
participation of women on activities performed outside of the home, such as market employment,
entrepreneurship, or participation in politics.

***

>Our findings provide evidence that current differences in gender attitudes and female behavior
have indeed been shaped by historical differences in agricultural systems. Specifically, we have
shown that individuals, ethnicities and countries whose ancestors used the plough have beliefs
that exhibit greater gender inequality today and have less female participation in non-domestic
activities, like market employment, entrepreneurship, and politics. In an effort to identify a channel
of cultural persistence, we examined variation across second-generation female immigrants
born and living in the US, but from different cultural backgrounds. We find that even among
this group of individuals, who face the same labor market, institutions, and policies, a history of
plough use is associated with less female labor force participation.

[ON THE ORIGINS OF GENDER ROLES: WOMEN AND THE PLOUGH](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17098.pdf?new_window=1)

Certain socioeconomic activities and certain social norms/values reinforced each other in creating and perpetuating the subordination of women at all levels. The exclusion of women from certain roles was correlated with considering them less capable, as a gender, to fulfill said roles."
947,"I think that it started from a biological standpoint. Since Cavemen the men would typically be the hunters due to their biological strength. Due to testosterone, men are inherently physically stronger, assuming the same conditions."
948,"This is a very interesting comment and reference about origins of gender roles and the plough, I also head this at other places before.

I can only speak for Europe here, not sure what on what culture or region you are writing? But  I'd argue the implications of the plough didn't automatically meant supremacy or inferiority. I have read that this just meant more social cohesion in way, because both tasks were equally important, thus no one was inferior and part of the bigger whole. Both work was equally honored and while this emergence of gender roles might be a sort of ""rule""  in some cultures but that there we're many exceptions to this as well. Some of my friends were saying that in some culture it was no big deal at all to do the role of the other gender. Friedrich Engels in [The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/origin_family.pdf) talks about how only the accumulation of wealth through better techniques like a ploughs and other technologies lead men to take over power through the establishment of an idea (private) property. Religions also played a role, Christianity has some quite misogynistic elements, but it there are also feminist interpretations of Christianity (e.g. A Big-Enough God: A Feminist's Search for a Joyful Theology, by Sara Maitland) that hit at the option that might have been counter-narratives all the time. 

Another big change happened with the introduction of the ""modern women"". This starts from the witchhunts at the end of the middle ages from the 13th-16th century. During the middle ages women were well organized and also widely ""acknowledged"" as essential parts of the whole. Silvia Federici in Caliban and the Witch talks about this and this also where my knowledge on this comes from. The witch hunts accumulated money that were used to start the colonial system and this lead to Western patriarchy going global. Marie Mies with ""Patriarchy and Accumulation On A World Scale"" is a really good book by this, even though written by a while German sociologist. I have read the chapter on Colonialization and Houswifization and it was tracing how women gender roles changed since the middle ages multiple times and how this also lead to forms of racial womenhood, where white womenhood was clearly different then ingenious womenhood. This might be where issues of ""white feminism"" are rooted. This also meant the ingenious gender roles had to be broken up and gender, sex, the body and reproduction as a whole was reconstructed imposing Western ideas. I can send you more literature on this if tell me the region or culture you're working on! Let me know if you have trouble finding these books! If you have more questions or my comments don't make sense or are unclear let me know, I'm glad to help!"
949,"I'm no expert but here's my theory:

*Generally speaking* men are physically stronger than women because males and females have different muscle structures. Men being stronger and more powerful and women being more agile and graceful. There are many more male body builders than female ones, and many more female gymnasts than male ones, but of course there are numerous exceptions, but still the generalization stands.

In early human societies men would use this strength as hunters and leave the women to forage. Foraging is less physically demanding in a running around and chasing prey sense, therefore they could bring the young with them. They also have breasts, obviously, so they can feed the kids too.

Since early societies were primitive, big buff ooga booga cave men could use their strength to dominate over women. Just look at how the biggest chimp dominates weaker ones. As cultures became more advanced that kinda men>women deal stayed with them. Even in medieval times, strength and power was a huge part of what made the world go round.

Around the industrial revolution was when women started being a tad bit more independent, since there were more jobs that didn't require hard, strength reliant physical labor. At that point through, the culture of men being the one up top had been driven so hard home it was basically alien to suggest women be in charge.  Also note the societal structures of land and business ownership. Men as providers meant that men were making the money, and with money comes status. Women gained their status through their husbands or parents.

However, as women began to get more and more freedom they started showing that ""hey, ladies are capable people too,"" and gained the respect of men. Think of Emilia Earhart or Annie Oakley, hell take a look at the Russian Women's Battalion of Death. Everyone doubted them and now they are cultural icons, revered by men and women alike. I can confidently say that since I myself am a male.

In short it comes down to anatomical differences. Men made ideal hunters and warriors, where women made better foragers and kiddie carers. In future times men became the better laborers and providers, and women were best fore taking care of the home and still the kids. That stayed true up until modern society. But now jobs are less physically demanding than ever, meaning women and men can perform the same tasks just as well as each other, and men can become more involved at home, therefore increased equality.

You can still see though, labor intensive work such as construction or military service is still male dominated, but kid oriented stuff like teaching is much more female, sadly."
950,"I had a theory about it. Fundamentally, male supremacy exists to cater to the emotional needs of men. The reason misogyny exists is because a few men started it and it got popular. When we look at other types of oppressed groups (like the jews through the centuries, black ppl, gay ppl) we see all kinds of things in common with the privileged group enforcing the oppression: jealousy, self pity, gaslighting, claiming it’s the ‘natural way’, and feeling threatened of losing power. Remember the witch hunts? Where we pretended certain women were from the devil and eat children? Yeah those women weren’t witches, they owned land, held wisdom about healing for instance and could also magically create children. And that way pass that power onto their daughters. Men didn’t like that. 
Women are called ‘inferior’ just like a bully in school would pretend you are ‘inferior’. It’s because they feel threatened by you. Jealousy leads to hate what leads to contempt what leads to thinking somebody is trash. Imagine living in the Dark Ages and 50% of the population could create other human beings, but not you and your 50%. 
Personally I don’t believe that women are naturally physically weaker. How bad would that be for the tribe, if they wanted to flee but the males would constantly have to save the females like we think it used to work. That would be completely unpractical. I think women have a physical ‘disadvantage’ over men because 

1. Girls don’t play outside and stay fit as much as boys. Most girls also quit doing sport once they go to highschool. 
2. Constantly hearing from a young age that boys are stronger and you will never be better than the other 50% could actually affect your confidence and performance. 
3. Girls, or at least I, don’t want to be seen as competitive beasts during sportclass, not like the boys are. 
4. Girls are fed less than boys. Especially in Asian and developing countries. In the west this still plays. Parents want their sons to eat proteins and grow big while there is a stereotype about women ‘not having a big appetite’ (even more in other continents) which is of course bullshit. 
5. Don’t forget the bullshit dieting-phase 85% of preteen girls go through. 
6. Men’s gravity center is in their chest, women’s is in their hips. Women have way more strength in their legs but that’s actually never focused upon ever.
6.1/2. Don’t forget how until 2018 girls had to have a certain thigh gap or have very thin legs. 
7. Sexual selection: physically strong women being seen as unattractive and therefore unable to marry. This has been practice for centuries."
951,"I agree, but I'd also add that because of the differences in strength, the stronger had the ability to dominate and treat the weaker people like objects.

In addition to actual physical strength, women also have the added vulnerability of being pregnant and thus more dependent on men for survival for themselves and their offspring.

The reality is actually so much more nuanced than this, but yeah I'd say the physical differences laid the groundwork for oppression."
