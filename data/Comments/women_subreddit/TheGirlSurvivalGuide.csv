0,"TomboyX has fantastic offerings, it's woman owned, and caters to gender diverse folks. 

&#x200B;

If you want something with similar coverage but slightly more loose and more traditionally feminine, bloomers are it. Something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WIRQB4M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). These are fantastic to wear in the summer w/ skirts and dresses."
1,But have you discovered his hoodies
2,First question- You wear them to bed? Or under your clothes? Do you wear his boxers or boxer-briefs?
3,"I miss having mens boxer briefs. I got some when still living at home (Mum bought the wrong style for the then step dad so I nabbed them), but mum didn't like me wearing them and chucked them out which is a damn shame as they are very comfy."
4,"FOXERS

They make boxers specifically for women. I'm slowly replacing all the underwear I own with these as I can also just wear them around the house/to bed. They have good sales pretty frequently."
5,"I started snagged my husband's boxer briefs to sleep in when I was pregnant! My kid is 17 months and I still steal them! I buy him boxer briefs from Old Navy. They are a stretchy t shirt type fabric and come in lots of patterns. They can feel a little pricy so I usually will go into the store and find the ones on clearance. They stay pretty snug, but not tight, so you could wear them under most clothes. Jeans are a maybe, depending on the cut and tightness."
6,Thank you! That’s really good to know!
7,Yep this ^^^
8,This so much.
9,"I wear them around the house and to bed, honestly I’d love to wear them under my clothes (primarily jeans), and I think they are boxer-briefs!"
10,That’s rude! Get more and then just wear them under comfy clothes!
11,Wow that's quite ridiculous and invasive of your mum? Why is it any of her business what kind of knickers you wear?

13,Do you wear cotton underwear that fully contain your bits? I wonder if that would help.
14,"Full coverage underwear, not thongs, will help - make sure everything is contained and not rubbing on your pants.

Make sure you aren't drying everything out with soap. Use a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil to keep clean and the lipid barrier intact. Soap is too harsh on vulvas! Also don't over dry with toilet paper or powders."
15,"You might try (if you have any) coconut oil (please don't buy this right now, it's not essential-essential, if you know what I mean). But, if you can access some, it might help with the irritation."
16,I use unscented deodorant after I shave to keep chaffing and ingrown hairs down. Might be a little awkward applying but might help and would be less messy than coconut oil.
17,I do. My cotton granny panties. It seems to be more irritating bright after I shave. I’m thinking it has to do a lot with lack of moisture.
18,"I’ll try Cetaphil! I don’t use any powders or anything outside of the shower. Just normal TP use, I think."
19,"This is a great idea! I hadn’t thought about it being super dry. I also live in Colorado, and it’s so dry here. Thank you for the tip!"
20,"No problem! It's also supposed to have anti-inflammatory properties, so that cold play a role too"
21,"Yes, we all come in different shapes and sizes. I recommend you find some celebrities that resemble your proportions, just to help normalize the way you look in your mind. 

Make sure you don't project your fears of being flawed or different onto your body, because that can lead to a dark and slippery slope. Everybody is afraid of that sometimes. It's a fleeting fear that flickers across all of humanity. You can feel it for a moment and then let it go."
22,"Depending on your body shape, yes, it may be normal to have no hips. You can try to increase their size by exercising the muscles in that area, however much that gives you, though it will take some systematic effort."
23,"There are exercises that can decrease hip dips, if you have them."
24,Thanks! Not too sure what to google lol and I’m usually pretty good at that!! Living in LA it seems like everyone around you is perfect and I know logically they aren’t but I just can’t help but seem inferior. Especially since I wasn’t born here.
25,Guess I’ll start going to the gym after this is over!
26,"I would sit down and draw a line all the way down the center of a piece of paper. On the left side write five points about what about you feels inferior. Next to each one of them make a counter point on the right side of the paper about why it's an irrational belief. 

Then journal a paragraph about why you think you have been believing these things even though you know it's not rational. I bet you learn lot about yourself and you feel wayyy better after you do it."
27,Your roommate put it in your stuff to hide it from her parents before she moved out.
28,the person in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/fl3fho/an_awkward_advice_request_my_college_is_making_us/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) had the same problem; it might be helpful!
29,Act shocked and pretend it was a prank by one of your roommates?
30,My door is locked and none of my roommates are home either way. It really does just come down to the story that I invent
31,Why even mention it? It’s not like your parents have never masturbated.
32,"Honestly, unless it's obviously penis shaped, they might not even realize what it is. Or if they are anything like my mother, they might throw it away because they think its disgusting you have one, but are too uncomfortable to confront you about it."
33,"Is the dresser yours?  If they're moving the whole piece of furniture, even if they take the drawers out to make it easier to move, you might get away with it that way. 

Having a backup is always a good idea though.  The most important part of selling whatever lie you go with is letting them bring it up.  Have nerves of steel.  You have to be patient, and probably play a little dumb.  If they call mad as hell, ""assume"" they're pranking you, that they've somehow started packing up your roommates room, or that it's some other vaguely cylindrical object which is TOTALLY NOT A SEX TOY, OMG EW MOM AND DAD.  

An important aspect of your story is going to be you considering if you have ANYTHING ELSE they might find.  Condoms.  Lube.  A conveniently located shelf of sexy romance novels. If they find something they don't like when moving you out, I'd just go ahead and assume they're going to look at the rest of your stuff more carefully.  If they don't, great!  But if they do, you've got to be ready for it.  

If they confront you about the toy in person, same kind of thing.  Obviously, you have to recognize it, in that scenario.  

Someone else in the comments suggested pretending a roommate had hid it in your things to hide it from their parents-- that's a little too complicated for my taste.  Why wouldn't this girl have just thrown it away, or hid it elsewhere in her stuff?  What if your parents want to turn their moral outrage on her, or talk to her parents?  I've seen crazier stuff tbh.  Anyway, that lie is a little too illogical, and honestly you don't have a reason to know what your roommate's sex toy looks like (not without sidetracking them into a whole other kind of rage, anyway) so it's all a little too weird.

IMO, gag gift is your best bet.  Definitely put some thought into your backstory.  A birthday gift from a girlfriend?  Which one?  When?  Etc.  Depending on where you go to school a creative one (which doesn't incriminate anyone real/that you like) would be some suitably wild tale about how one night you were out doing X with your friends when you encountered a bachelorette party full of alumni who were totally plastered, and revisiting their favorite college bars!  Spin it into this whole tale of how you helped the one crying drunk girl find her phone so she could call her fiance, as crying drunk girls love to do.  As payment, she drunkenly lectured you on dating advice and gifted you that toy before some friends got her into an uber headed home.  Since bachelorette parties always have dick-shaped everything, I think that hits a good balance of ""believable,"" and ""too unbelievable to make up.""  And a lot of questions they might ask can very reasonably be answered with ""Ugh, I don't KNOW, okay?  That's just what happened/what they were doing!""  Depending on your parents' level of intensity, you might want to give a few friends a heads up about that in advance, so they know the story.  Full sleepover protocol in effect, here!

Whatever you go with, just make sure not to come out with the whole thing all at once!  It shouldn't be them showing you the toy and you frantically laughing and going FUNNY STORY!  No.  Groan, put your head in your hands, and whine about how embarrassing it is.  The first time you tell the story, go light on the details, since they'll probably have you rehash it like nine times.

Source: My parents' crazy isn't of exactly the same brand as yours, but holy wow do I have a lot of (past) experience with this game.  Which is hilarious considering I never really got up to anything terribly interesting.  Good luck!!"
34,Is there any way you could ask a friend who's still there/nearby to go and remove it for you before they arrive?
35,"Um, own it and tell them to act like mature adults?"
36,do you have a bag you can lock?
37,"Do you have a box or a bag where you can put your dirty laundry in, including underwear, so they do not want to touch it anyhow? You could place it in there. You would have to hope to be able to do your laundry at your parents place yourself, before they get to it.   
Other than that - do you by chance have a big pile of tampons and other products they may be embarrassed by, that you could hide it in?"
38,"According to AOL.co.uk: Orgasm
Combats stress,

Relieves headaches.

Tell them this"
39,"Tell them that it's your room mates drawer and to not empty it, tell them you gave her that drawer as she needed some extra room."
40,">It’s not like your parents have never masturbated.

If they're both religious and conservative, there is a real chance that her mom never has. Most conservative religious women I know think masterbation is either a sin or impossible for women to begin with."
41,"Yes, just don’t talk about it. They know about life and they’ll be glad you’re living it."
42,Bold assumption to make of religious parents....
43,"Try EDM nothing romantic about it :) 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6pquk1zWYc"
44,Not sure what style you like but I’m super into The 1975 and they have quite a few songs that aren’t about that.
45,"You could go for wackier stuff - They Might Be Giants, Robyn Hitchcock (I like the albums Globe of Frogs, and Queen Elvis), the Residents

Some other bands I can think of that have very few romantic songs  -  XTC, The Pixies, Jane's Addiction, Green Day, Veruca Salt."
46,"Well, I'm not sure if their works are something that you will enjoy, but I do quite like Rhapsody of Flames. It's anyone's guess whether it's best counted as rock or metal (a bit of both, I guess), but it is definitely somewhat intense and definitely not romantic music."
47,"Lots of jazz is purely instrumental. [Aaron Parks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKkEOVqMDG8) is one of my favorite composers. There's also bands like [Chon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ7O58W641g), [Intervals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTMImfRa1dA), and [Scale the Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y8SV0o6dYw) if you like listening to really busy music."
48,Try a different language if you don't have anything against the music style itself.
49,One of my favorite singers is AURORA-- her songs are mostly about things like feeling your own power and saving nature!
50,"I love the 1975, however majority of there music is relationship related. But I’d check out Love it if we made it, give yourself a try, I like America, America likes me and People. Those aren’t about love"

52,"Therapist here! Finding online therapy now is identical to how finding in-person therapy was before Corona. I usually suggest a psychologytoday search of clinicians near you (in case you want in-person follow-up when available!). You can also choose certain criteria for clinicians in this search, ie gender, specialty, etc. Another option is to go through your insurance company to find clinicians they cover. Many insurances (including those who normally don’t) currently cover tele-therapy! If you don’t have insurance, look for a clinician who offers a “sliding scale,” which means they’ll change their rates based on your income. Good for you on reaching out. I hope you find good help!"
53,"I googled my local area and then logged into the provider portal in my insurance and compared and tried out a few til i found one I liked. 

DO NOT BE AFRAID TO SKIP AROUND TIL YOU FIND ONE YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH. I can't stress that enough and don't feel bad about it either. My current therapist told me on day one ""what didn't work with the others and how would you like me to speak with you"" basically we treat therapy like a normal conversation that goes both ways. 

This is about you helping you."
54,Thanks for the great advice!
55,"Day Drinking. Online shopping. Long dog walk. And then a Zoom party with my friends. 

My bday isn't until mid april, but it's a friends bday today. I dropped off at present outside her house and am hosting the zoom happy hour for her tonight. I sent out the email invite to all our friends. She loves her cats, so it's a cat themed happy hour. I've asked everyone to dig out or make cat ears to wear. We'll be hanging out chatting, drinking, and I've got some trivia to play if things start to get a bit boring."
56,I ordered in fajitas and margaritas since it's legal to order alcohol in texas and luckily have a nice green yard to lay in and tan 🤷🏻‍♀️ towards the end of the night some friends and I picked a game that could be played across multiple platforms so we could talk and play together.

58,"Similar, friends dropped off pastries and Champaign and organized a zoom hang.  Then went on a walk with a friend (only been seeing each other through all this) we made mimosas for the walk. Then ordered pizza and watched a movie.  Super low key but actually was pretty fun"
59,A Zoom party is such a fun idea! You sound like a great friend :)
60,That sounds like a really nice day! Hope you had a good birthday!
61,It was definitely different. I've always felt awkward and dreaded my birthday and most forgot the day of so while it sucked it wasnt awful. It was nice that we could plan to play games a few days later once we found a game we would all like and could all play.
62,"I think what matters is *how* irritated with you he gets. Like, if you miss a spot on a dish and he sighs and rolls his eyes and asks you to fix it, that's one thing, but if he's saying anything hurtful or calling you names or raising his voice or something like that, it might be something to be concerned about."
63,"My husband and I may be weird...and by most couples' standards we way over communicate, but for us it has lead to very little irritation. Like, I can count on one hand the number of times one of us has been visibly irritated with the other in five years. 


For us a couple of things have helped: 

> If you have a strong feeling about the way something should be done, you need to speak up about it early. (And you should probably offer to do the task, time allowing.) EX: I am VERY particular about how the sheets go on the bed, so I generally make the bed. If he's making the bed to do something nice for me, he knows it's only nice if he does it my way haha 

>We sit down once every few months and talk about every task that needs to be done. This includes writing out frequency expectations, and each of our general interest in completing the task. EX: It's getting to be spring, so we need to start mowing weekly. DH loves to mow, so he'll pick up that, and I'll start doing more dog walking to balance. I wont mow unless I'm willing to do it his way lol and I'm not willing, so I'm generally not mowing-but am happy to flex time/effort elsewhere! 

>We both come from super dysfunctional families, where each parent hated the other. Talking about this has really informed the way we talk to one another. Requests or criticism always Always ALWAYS have to be brought to each other with respect, and without accusation. It is never him VS me, and always us VS whatever the situation. If you're not ready to bring something up through those filters, you need to check your own attitude first. 

I think all of the things we do generally boil down to being exceptionally mindful about respecting one another. Respecting the person, their time, their wants/needs, and their efforts. It has to go both ways, or you end up a doormat. But when you're both focused on it, there's almost no need or cause for irritation or fighting, or any of that jazz. :)"
64,"I don’t know your situation so am wary of reading too much into it. But some of the things you’re describing sound like red flags for abusive behaviour, especially the more nonsensical things like not closing blinds at the right time or not reminding him to wear a jacket, or what you’ve said in other comments where you’ll fix one issue but he finds something else to be angry about. I’m not saying it is or not but ask yourself - is this something a reasonable person might be irritated by? Do you feel comfortable about raising things that irritate you yourself? Do you feel like he respects your boundaries?

Again not saying either way, it’s very normal to get irritated with people you’re living in close quarters with, especially with the current lockdown situation. However, sometimes behaviours like these can be early warning signs of abuse - for an abuser, it’s not that they’re genuinely irritated, it’s a method of slowly gaining more control over you, making you doubt yourself, making you more reliant on him etc. It may be that you’re having normal irritations with each other in a stressful time, but take time to check in with yourself and understand what’s happening for you. As women we’re taught not to enforce our own boundaries, to bend ourselves to please others, but this can leave us vulnerable when we meet someone who knows how to exploit that. Have a think - if this does flag anything up for you pm me, I’m happy to talk or be a listening ear."
65,"With my current SO (together about 3 years), we have a big knockdown tearful argument about every 6 months. I can tell there's more tension since we're both home for quarantine now, but we aren't arguing."
66,"We get irritated with each other a lot (probably daily with little things) because we have a different approach to almost everything. But the reason we've been together so long (15 years) is because we can laugh about it and give each other shit. We actually learn from each other too. 

But.  There have been times when we've been cruel to one another, usually due to other circumstances like hunger or sleeplessness, over stupid non-essential things and that's when we have to regroup. If you can't get back on track the little things can really add up and turn into a HUGE issue."
67," Yeah semi regularly and it generally means we need to rebalance our lives to have a bit less time together. We spend a lot of time at work and can easily go a week only seeing work and each other. I used to think that love was wanting to spend my whole life with them when actually that’s not healthy; having friends and hobbies and outside interests is better. So whenever I start getting irritable at my husband, I think about if I have done enough without him recently and often the answer is no. It’s something we have to keep working on as when we met we had a huge friendship group and they have gradually moved away and life changed. I know when I am irritated, he isn’t in the wrong and actually, I’m not either, it’s just a cue to get out the house and do something. He rarely gets irritable with me because he is a saint even though I am a slob."
68,"Well, question is how often, so... in my best (now ex) relationship, we lived together for like a month, and visible irritation happened I'd say once. Honestly the relationship was great and after him I'd not settle for anyone that irritates me more than that. So normal/healthy for me is once a month.

That being said, I was going to work and not 24/7 together in closed flat like now you guys with the quarantine. Also, norms change if health problems are present (like massive headache), but in those case I'd get irritated at every single thing and try to go to sleep or something, and not use him as a punching bag.

&#x200B;

Edit: wanted to add that usual case (two other relationships, both lasted about 2 years and included about a year of life together) had irritations every single day and multiple times. So i'd assume its usual/normal? But not healthy for sure."
69,"It’s pretty normal, especially if neither of us or one of us is in a bad mood."
70,"Good question, I've also been thinking about this a lot. I know my partner and I love each other but it feels like we irritate each other maybe too often. I'm unsure if it's healthy because I haven't been in many relationships."
71,"> missing a spot on a dish you washed

Stuff like this would get on my nerves and gross me out of it was a consistent problem. It's like, the first handful of times you point it out its nbd, but if it's a persistent issue despite the innumerable times you've mentioned it, then it's like.. Why is this still happening?? 


And as an adult, it's not like washing dishes properly is a special skill only select few are capable of, so it shouldn't be up to the other person to wash all dishes for eternity just because someone's got bad washing hygiene lol. Sorry, dealt with this in the past lol."
72,"I was married for 11 years and now divorced. Him being irritated about things started slowly until they became daily issues. Most of the things I should not have put up with, but I finally reached my breaking point when I started to really pay attention to HOW he spoke to me...raising his voice, belittling me, etc that I realized is behavior that I can't allow for my young sons to be around and to normalize. It's not okay."
73,"In addition to the question of how often is appropriate for one partner to get irritated at the other, I would also ask yourself how that irritability makes you feel. Do you feel low-key tense around him, anxious that you'll do something wrong? Do you feel like you're walking on egg shells around him? If so, something's gotta change bc no one can sustain a relationship with that dynamic."
74,"Yes, but then I remember I am as iritating as him. So if I see he hasn't put the bin liner back in the bin, I get frustrated. But then I remember I've been shoving rubbish into an over-full bin and he made the initiative to take it out. So I put a new liner in the bin and go give him a cheek kiss because he cleans up after me as much as I clean up after him. He rarely empties the dishwater, but I leave dirty lunch containers in the sink for days. He doesn't brush the dog much, but I pick off his eye boogers (the dogs) and wipe it on the nearest surface. We are both gross and we both clean up after each other because we love and appreciate each other. The dog does nothing though, he's just a little love parasite making alll the mess."
75,Me and my boyfriend have been together over three years now. When he does something that annoys me I tell him right away (you left the toilet seat up again) or vice versa (you forgot to clean your hair out of the shower) and then we’ll go on with our day. It’s important to realize everyone makes mistakes it’s just the way you handle them.
76,"My boyfriend and I live together and we have a really relaxed relationship. He has ADD which understandably affects his ability to keep everything organized. I honestly don’t mind mess. I’m a bit messy myself, although better at organizing than he is (I think.) More importantly he does actually keep things clean and hygienic, it’s just mostly disorganization and clutter. 

If I get straight-up annoyed with him it’s usually because I’m feeling moody for whatever reason and he’s maybe laying on his jester side too thick. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and might get short with him.

Sometimes he’s been grumpy and has said insensitive things to me. There was a time it felt like he blamed me for him not being able to wake up for work on time because of his narcolepsy/insomnia and other sleeping issues; I felt bad and recognized that I could have tried harder to help him, but I also recognized some of the language he used as accusatory (he’d say things like “If I lose my job then you’ll know you didn’t help” etc etc.) The second or third time it happened, I just made my side very clear: I’ll try harder to help him wake up, but I don’t want to hear stuff like that because in my opinion it’s NO ONE’S fault. I understand he has a sleeping issue and I will try my best to support him as a partner in life, but I do not want to hear him say mean things to me like that.

... I didn’t say it exactly like that but I think he got the point right away regardless. He apologized right away, I made more effort and we worked through that and have never had that issue again. 

We’re all flawed humans... there’s things I do that he gets annoyed with too at times. I think my problem is that I have a habit of wanting to ask questions and be guided through every new thing I do, so if it’s something he can do he usually bears the responsibility of answering my dumb questions or showing me. I also ask stupid questions kind of often (not overplaying it, I genuinely don’t realize how stupid they are until they come out my mouth lol) I imagine that gets pretty annoying at times.

While these flaws are often inevitable and some bad habits are *ingrained* into us, we always recognize our flaws and try to put in a little bit of effort to make it easier on each other. I think that’s what matters the most.

We’ve been quarantined together alone for like 3 weeks now and it’s been a blast; not a single iffy habit he does will ever change how happy I am to be around him in general. I gladly take time every day to make sure he knows that and is loved and appreciated for every positive thing he does and he does the same for me, so the little flaws or occasional human mistakes really don’t hold a candle to that :)

I personally think there should never be a feeling like your partner is passive aggressively holding your mistakes over your head or something!"
77,"For my boyfriend I think it comes in waves.

For me, not too often I really don’t get bothered"
78,It comes and goes and it's always pretty small stuff. We're both more likely to cry than to yell or cold shoulder.
79,"I see people posting sometimes who are like GASP we would never bicker! And I figure those people must be suppressing a lot. I think it's normal to get irritated by small things when you live with someone else because as a separate person, they are never going to do things exactly as you would. That probably happens every day/every other day with us. But the crucial thing is how you handle it. Getting totally bent out of shape about small things isn't cool. We tend try to use humor to make the point.

One of the game changers for us was realizing we really shouldn't talk about anything before breakfast! We were both snapping at each other a lot in the morning early in the relationship but it was more a result of being undercaffinated/underfed and trying to get out the door for work."
80,"Chiming in real quick - agree with what everyone else wrote. Also wanted to mention that I come from a super dysfunctional house, and also didn't feel like I had a meter for normal/acceptable argument levels. If possible, seeing a therapist, even a few times, can help because he/she can provide insight on what should be ok, as well as helping you flesh out how you feel about it, and possible ways to address it. In my case, she helped validate that it was ok to ask for what I need, and to ask for non-angry/stressful/PTSD-causing critiques (basically just no raised voices and be aware of phrasing). For context, we argued/disagreed maybe once every few months, but I was so insecure in my ability to have my own feelings that I would feel terrible after."
81,"How often do we get irritated with each other? Lots! But how often do we actually SAY something about it....not too much.
Our first year of marriage I was admittedly too nit picky and it caused some tension for sure. We’re on year three and in a very comfortable place - we can be annoyed about something, but we won’t actually call them on it if it isn’t a big deal. My husband frequently puts away dishes he didn’t wash properly. I mentioned it to him once, he has made an effort to improve, but it still happens. And it’s just easier to let it slide and wash it myself than cause an issue with it. 
Being annoyed with someone will absolutely happen when you are living together. BUT you need to both be able to handle that annoyance maturely. Without knowing the situation perfectly, I would say that your partner is not being fair. It sounds like he is really struggling with patience, and I personally would have a very hard time dealing with someone who got pissed every time I made a little mistake. Putting away a dirty dish twice a year is no big deal - my hubs does it once a week lol. Forgetting to close blinds is DEFINITELY not a big deal. If it’s so important to him, he should close them himself.

Basically, if something is super important to you, either do it yourself or have a conversation with the person. If it’s just a dumb mistake, there is no reason to get worked up over it.

Try to picture yourself living with this person for 10 more years with him picking at you like that. If you think you can handle it and it’s worth the trade off, great. If you think he needs to shape up or ship out, great.
Give him a chance to stop the behavior, but if he refuses to be more kind and patient (or to at least TRY), then it might not be a good situation.

I promise the life stressors you two go through will only increase over time. If he can’t handle minor inconveniences, I worry about how he would treat major problems in the future. 

Now, I was very picky my first year of marriage, so I’m not completely saying you should boot him. But when my husband sat me down and let me know how it made him feel, I made a huge effort to change. And it was soooo worth it. 
I would suggest having a very serious conversation with him and see how he responds."
82,"Yeah, that makes sense. I think more reflection is in order. Thank you!"
83,Thank you! Communication is a huge point that whether it's my thing or his we don't do the most of. I very much appreciate the input. Thorough communication sounds like a pretty great setup!
84,Conversation is still so underrated.
85,Thank you! I think it's good to know that relationships exist without frequent arguing.
86,Thanks for sharing your experience! I think it's definitely valuable to be able to learn from each other.
87,"Thanks for sharing! That's definitely true, and it's hard to get out and do things on our own now but that will be useful to keep in mind in the future."
88,"Thank you so much for sharing your experience! 

It's definitely a once or twice daily thing. I think it might be worse during quarantine but I also think I'm feeling more anxious about everything right now and I know it happened before quarantine too, so it's kind of hard to gauge if I'm overreacting due to anxiety or not. But definitely never been anywhere near one time in a month. Or even in a week probably. Anyway thank you!!"
89,"Neither have I, and I'm not sure my parents are necessarily the healthiest model either so I just feel like I missed some lessons in how to be an adult."
90,"Thank you for your input!! 

In my case I think that particular thing has happened twice in three years, and he's definitely been mad about it both times. I think what makes me confused about whether it's me or not is that it's always something different. So I'll fix each problem but there's just always another thing I've done wrong. 

Sometimes, like not reminding him to wear a jacket, I feel pretty comfortable telling myself that it isn't my fault that he isn't in a jacket. But other things I just don't know whether he's getting more frustrated about them than is reasonable or whether I'm making more mistakes than is reasonable."
91,"Good luck :) Don't mind those small irritations like eye-roll or a left cup somewhere, or some hair in shower drain. What I think is needed in relationship is to honestly answer to yourself- does he charge you with good emotions, or drain you with irritation? Only you know answer for that. And perhaps escape if he's energy-vampiring you. 

But as I said, can't put my situation as a general thing so don't take anything I say as unsolicited advice: I cope with the outside world problems by silently hugging my partner while holding my head to his chest and listening to his breathing/heartbeat (well , when im not single :( ), so its essential for me to be able to do it.  For some it might not be as needed. I have to know that even if the argument is with the guy, I can just ""pause"" like Lilly and Marshall in HIMYM. While others prefer more dynamic relationships with a spice of drama and there's nothing wrong with that."
92,"Twice in three years hardly makes it something to get upset over, that's probably the standard rate of human error for anyone lol. You can be annoyed or grossed out about it for a minute, but it certainly doesn't merit getting all moody and passive aggressive about the rest of the evening.



He's upset at you for not reminding him to wear a jacket? What kind of baby behavior is that??"
93,"From your discription...these are very weird things for him to get *irritated* by....

If there’s a spot on my dish once every few months, I’ll just go to the sink and scrub it off...

I would also never ever even *start* to blame someone for something that is obviously not their responsibility....like, my mind would not even go there...

Try to imagine yourself reacting the way he does to the same things....wouldn’t you feel like you were over-reacting?"
94,"I'm gonna save this comment :) thank you. I know everyone is different, but I feel like these are some pretty good base-line tips/checks."
95,"Lol yeah that one was easy for me to deflect but sometimes it is stuff that I've done accidentally that definitely is annoying, like the dishes. I don't want to give too many other examples in case he were to happen upon this post but things that are I would say similar in inconvenience/severity. 

I don't know, I'm just trying to reflect on what makes me feel good and whether I'm being overly sensitive."
96,"Yeah, I agree. I totally would feel like I was overreacting, but I tend to feel like I'm overreacting all the time so I am never completely sure that it's me. I'm going to try to pay more attention and reflect more about how I'm feeling! Thank you!"
97,"I think there's a difference between blaming someone like it's a character flaw, vs acknowledging a mistake was made that was annoying. And again, it's not something that should color the mood for the rest of the evening. 


It's like saying that an action was dumb, vs calling someone dumb."
98,"> I tend to feel like I'm overreacting all the time

You feel this way, and yet it seems that you are, objectively, less reactive than your partner.

Here’s another thing to consider: how would *he* take if *you* reacted to things to the same degree that he does? 

Has he *already* accused you of being over-reactive, at times, even though you are - again - objectively less reactive than he is?

Is the reason that you are posting the above because you *currently* worry that you are over-reacting to his irritability?

Because - again again - you are objective less reactive than he is.

Which means that he is holding you to a significantly higher standard than he is holding his own self."
99,"Yeah this makes sense, similar to what u/mduck_ was saying. I'll be trying to pay more attention in the future. Thank you!"
100,"Check our the resources over at r/MakeupAddiction.

Honestly, there isn't anything wrong with drugstore brands. I love me some Nyx and Elf as much as my Urban Decay. In fact, I use ud almost exclusively for eye shadow since the colors are vibrant, have long wearability, and take forever to go through. But I use elf setting powder and nyx eye liner as well as some other items since they get used up faster.

Eyeliner is tricky. I use tape to get those nice wing lines going.  

I vote to just find pictures of some looks you like, and then try to replicate it on your own. Sometimes techniques dont work well from person to person. For example, I use my fingers to put on my eyeshadow because I feel I have more control and less residue under my eye after. You may find you like a pencil eyeliner over a felt tip liquid liner.

Keep experimenting with the stuff you have. A master painter didnt start with the most expensive oil paint, you dont need to start with the most expensive makeup."
101,"I personally found Michelle Phan helpful. She has some YouTube videos called ""Beauty Basics..."" that helped me get started.

I think it's also important to find makeup artists that look similar to you and have similar skin tones to you, since they'll know what colors look good on them and what works for their facial features. I literally looked up stuff like ""Filipina makeup"" or ""Asian makeup artist"" on YouTube and that seemed to work for me.

I'm also one of those people that use tape to get cleaner lines when I apply eyeliner or eyeshadow. I have waaaay too much washi tape anyway haha"
102,"Okay so first off, there is PLENTY of amazing quality makeup at cvs. You absolutely do not need to drop $400 at Sephora to have ‘good’ makeup.

What’s important is that you first understand what your skin needs. Do you have dry skin, normal or oily?
If you have dry skin, you should be looking for a ‘natural’ or ‘dewy’ finish foundation. Stay away from matte. If you have oily skin you WANT a matte foundation. If you have normal skin you can try whatever you want.

I’d start with looking up ‘best drugstore makeup of 2019’ videos on YouTube. There are so many and you’ll find a lot of people choose the same products so that’s a good base to know what the high quality, low budget products are.

I LOVE makeup and over half of what I use is drugstore."
103,Do you happen to use Urban Decay eyeliner pencil? Like it very much but lose a lot every time I sharpen it
104,"I use liquid liners, there are some pencils Im allergic to (or at least i think...?)"
105,"The going from multiple large monitors to a tiny laptop is definitely a thing for me! I can say that after 2 weeks I'm finally getting used to it! I'm actually managing better now.  Splitting screen between local laptop and RDT is still a struggle but its gotten a lot better! 

I'm definitely noticing more work so I'm guessing people are now adjusting to working remotely. I have definitely enjoyed the waking up 5 mins before clocking in and working in loungewear!"
106,Can you ask your manager if you can take one of your screens home to use in the meantime. Or expense another monitor? They aren't hard to set up yourself.
107,I’m lucky that I’ve been working full time exclusively from home for six years and I had to create an office environment for myself to be as productive as possible. I remember when I first started with my crappy laptop and it was terrible. A lot of investment went into my home office and my employer has tons of systems in place for remote work. I imagine it’s been hell for people who are not used to working from home.
108,"I'm happy to be working from home solely because I'm pregnant. I'm so glad to be able to limit my exposure to people. However, when this is all over I'm gonna be like get me the eff outta this house. I'm too much of an extrovert for full-time work from home."
109,"I can't do more that 2 days with anyone. At festivals by day three I've run off to have a morning by myself. Friends, family, partners. I never desire company like I desire time alone. 

When it comes to partners I've accepted that this will be how I am in any relationship. It would even probably be how I am with my own children. 

I enforce time on my own. I preempt it so I don't get agitated. Take breaks or call an early end to time together. 

I've already discussed that if I moved in with current partner I'd need to still have my own room within the home to facilitate alone time and I suppose to help me feel like I can enforce that boundary if I need to. 

When my partner suggested living in together during lockdown I said absolutely not."
110,"It sounds like you just need alone time to focus/recharge. My husband and I love each other and have been married for almost 10 years,  but sometimes we just need to be alone and away from each other for a few hours. Committing to love someone does not mean you have to enjoy spending every waking second together."
111,"My boyfriend has his own office In the spare bedroom, so when we want time to ourselves he goes and play games in there, or he takes a shower. 

I’ll put my headphones in. I need time to myself or I’ll go nuts lol"
112,Pretty normal. I love alone time. My fiancé will go play games on his computer so I can have the TV to myself to watch Netflix and shut off my brain.
113,"I wanted to say, a ""2 week trip"" is veeeery different from staying 2 weeks at someones house! Don't compare the two"
114,"If you guys are living together, what do you do to get alone time?"
115,"We go to different rooms and do separate activities (like reading, scrolling reddit, taking q bath, working, etc). That decompression time is so important, esp. since we’re both pretty introverted. I hope that helps! :)"
116,"Yup, that's what my partner and I do too."
117,"Absolutely, I was getting into a perfect workout routine for myself and the pandemic really messed it up. As important as it is to stay motivated (I.e. yoga at home, jogging if you can, body weight training), I’ve found it really helpful to practice self love with face masks, painting my nails, hair masks, even shaping your brows. It’s maintaining those little things that help throughout the day. Stay well!"
118," I'm sorry that your work involves a lot of social media, that's rough. I've recently deleted most of my social media because it was terrible for my self esteem and self image.  

I'm not sure if you've already seen it, but check out r/instagramreality. It helped me put things into perspective and raise my self esteem."
119,"I've been listening to [The Happiness Lab](https://open.spotify.com/episode/56K6HUfvdJUSa8eXjdW5ZY) podcasts on Spotify. I highly recommend them. Specifically, I'd check out the episode called [The Unhappy Millionaire](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3EUByDhchYHFgd5kVpME1O). The episode talks about how unhappy comparisons can make us, which you might find helpful right now.

It's a very informative podcast and really makes me want to do the Yale online courses.

Personally, in combination with the podcast, I'm trying to do Pilates every day. In the past, after a few weeks of daily sessions, I find my mood and energy improved as well as my flexibility. Billions of people love yoga for the same reason (but it's not personally for me). Another thing to love about that form of exercise is that it takes very little space and it's extremely quiet (in case you're in a shared house or an apartment)."
120,Thought not wearing makeup for 3 weeks would be wonderful for my skin but.. nope
121,"All these responses are super nice and helpful, i was just gonna suggest putting a sticky note over the screen where your face is displayed. Not really fixing the whole problem though... i’ve had jobs curating instagram feeds and i hatedddd it, sucked the life out of me."
122,"To combat this, I stopped following models and people that mainly post their body. I followed more artists, educational and meme pages. Is that possible with your job?"
123,Im still working but Im using the opportunity to train myself on eating smaller but more efficient meals and not snacking. Im trying to take more stairs (up and down) when Im at work to make up not being able to use the gym at home. My new schedule has really screwed up my IF schedule and trying to catch up physically to the guy Im seeing so this whole stay  inside thing has been extra hard.
124,"I sat down and figured I could use some extra hair care and finally got into the time consuming practices since I had time. It makes me feel pretty. 

Social media is not something to look at in these times. I usually find idiots who make my blood boil or other idiots that make me very very sad. 

Focus on yourself, and not on others! Appreciate your features in the mirror and don't be afraid to paint your nails weird colors or anything else you weren't brave enough to show off before. 

You're stuck at home and no one can come over, don't be shy!"
125,"It's definitely a hard thing to do. For my self-love, I try and remind myself that we're experiencing a lot of schedule changes, we're feeling a little isolated, we're experiencing huge levels of stress, and we're inundated by tragic news every day, so there are going to be changes to our well-being. We're going to be more tired than usual and we might not feel up to exercising and we might eat a few more cookies than usual, and that's okay because we're going through a crisis and we're doing the best we can right now. It's okay if our bodies change a bit as our lives change. 

And for distractions, I find taking up a new hobby can help keep me busy, like doing art or baking or journaling - something that makes a product that I can look at and be proud of. Hopefully this helps!"
126,"When I realized even going outside for a walk would soon be discouraged, I set up all my exercise gear in a corner. I don't have much - adjustable dumbbells, skipping rope, yoga mat etc., plus I picked up a secondhand elliptical for $30 - but having a workout goal every day and a (tiny) space for it makes *such* a difference! I'm probably going to be in better shape by the end of this than I have in years.

I'm making an effort with my personal grooming even on days when I don't leave the house. Not much makeup, but ironed clothes and shaved legs and tidy hair. Meal prepping so I can grab some veggies just as easily as I could grab a bag of chips. Getting a little sunlight, even if just on the mini-balcony while the neighbours wave. As far as self-image goes, I find that giving myself credit for doing those things means more to me than any comparison to Instagram models. 

Hang in there! And maybe cover your full-length mirror with a sheet for a while. If something in your home is doing you harm, it doesn't deserve to be there."
127,Yes pretty much really bad :( finally got into a workout routine and trying to eat better without starving myself or overeating
128,"Online exercise classes helped me, if that's something you're interested in. Having one set thing per day that I know I have to do keeps the rest of the day moving. Also, regulated bedtime and wakeup time. Sleep is important."
129,"Exercise and outside time are my sanity and basis of a routine. If you are allowed to walk while social distancing where you are, I’d take the kids for a walk after breakfast every morning, rain or shine. It’s how I’ve been keeping my sanity. Bonus points if you go early in the morning; where I live nobody else is out before 9 so social distancing is even easier then."
130,"Decide on a routine and just stick with it. It'll be hard at first but you'll adjust to it. Don't make it crazy strict - keep it reasonable. Write it down on a big visible whiteboard somewhere. 

My main goals are sticking to a set bed time, waking up time, eating schedule, and workout schedule. Even if I'm feeling lazy or in a bad mood, I do my daily workout. It's non-negotiable."
131,My daughter and I actually did some yoga! Definitely helped to make me feel like I accomplished something.
132,I definitely feel better on the days the weather is better. We haven’t had great weather lately which I’m sure isn’t helping this feeling. Thanks for the suggestions!
133,"Thanks, that is helpful. I think having it written somewhere will make it more real and therefore something I’m more likely to do."
134," No problem, I hope you find your footing the quickly! These are crazy times for sure!!"
135,"No problem! You can also make it an incremental approach so you don't get overwhelmed. Choose one new piece of the schedule to add each week. Maybe your first week could be waking up at 8am every day, for example. Make the process nice and easy!"
136,Oh that’s a great idea. Thanks!!
137,"That person, and everyone else in the community, would be even more exposed if people went about the usual business of going to the grocers for food. If you remove yourself from having to be around other people, it's a net positive for the whole system.

&#x200B;

Give them a larger tip and call or write letters to your local gov't officials and the companies you're buying from and ask for them to give those employees better pay and safety equipment."
138,"As a grocery worker, thank you for the consideration. Please don't feel an ounce of guilt about ordering online. We've got some regulars at my store who still can't grasp any of this and think its okay to come in multiple times a day just to get one item, if that."
139,"I would be chill. The fact that you’re not out grocery shopping is one less vector for the virus. Most of the retailers I’ve patronized appear to be making every attempt to protect their staff and minimize risk. Gloves, shields, limited store hours, etc. 

While this thing runs its course and plays out, certain things have to keep going."
140,"Besides the reasons people have already stated, consider the fact that the person who is delivering groceries is probably doing so because they need the money to support themselves and their families. If no one was ordering groceries, all those delivery people would be out of work and potentially struggling. Just make sure to tip really well, because delivery people people are generally underpaid."
141,"As someone who works at a grocery store with delivery and pickup, I have a few thoughts: 

1) our orders are backed up a minimum of 2 weeks. If you are able to get to the store and shop for yourself, I would recommend it to free spaces for those who are compromised/high risk. 

2) if you have to shop, buy enough food for 1-2 weeks and don't come back. Do not shop everyday! 

3) if you do use pickup or delivery, be kind and tip well to those that are coming out to you. We're working really hard to provide service to everyone! 

The choice is ultimately up to you. If you use the service, you should not feel guilty. That's what it's there for, regardless of your reasons for using it."
142,"Tip them really, really well. And look up the company you're using to make sure they're not striking today. If they don't have paid sick leave or a livable wage, support their efforts in the future to obtain those. They're an essential service and they should be paid like it."
143,"1) If you need groceries, you should not feel bad at all. You need to eat, and grocery delivery is the safest option.
2) I would check to make sure there are delivery times available, especially if you’re planning to subscribe to a service. My area has zero times available, so the service is useless 😕"
144,"The only way I'd feel iffy about you ordering groceries is if there's already a long queue and you're able bodied/have transportation. There's vulnerable disabled and elderly people who literally depend on online deliveries, so healthy able bodied people taking spots may create problems for them.


Otherwise, you not shopping is one less person shopping. And it's probably a gig economy job where they can choose to work hours if they want to. My friend works for Amazon and he's just straight up not going to work for the next couple weeks (as is his right to)."
145,"You don't need to be guilty, but you can help ""essential workers"" by channeling your guilt into supporting their fight for fair working conditions, including paid sick leave EVEN IF they aren't diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as hazard pay."
146,"Don't feel guilty, it's the responsible thing to do. As others have stated, make sure you're not taking much needed spots from those who need the protection. But otherwise, every person who is removed from the community is a point for humans.

Bonus if you check in with your elderly neighbors and get necessities for them in your order."
147,"If they just drop it off at your door, and do not interact with you a - a person who is taking this pandemic seriously - at all, then they are getting way less exposure than are the workers on the floor in the supermarket, itself, interacting with customers of varying levels of ignorance and conscientiousness all day."
148,"I understand feeling guilty. The person would probably be out anyways, though. And chances are that person needs money to support their family. Tip and be kind. You’re doing your part by staying home. :) IMO"
149,"It is justified, and you should also chill.   It's ok to worry about others while also talking care of yourself. And yoy ate helping everyone by staying home.   

Maybe donate to a local food pantry if you're really feeling down over the disparities."
150,Make sure to request that the delivery person drops it in front of the door rather than handing it to you; that's one less person they'll be exposed to today.
151,"Does the local government have the power to force companies to pay their employees a certain wage? ( I’m legitimately asking, not trying to criticize)."
152,"it's the same situation in many countries, and there are many vulnerable people who have been told to stay at home for months who need deliveries. if you are free of health conditions you can just follow the relevant safety precautions, and go stock up yourself."
153,"I feel like if you are well enough to go shopping safely you should, people who are unable to leave their houses (vulnerable people who have to isolate for 12+ weeks) can only have the deliveries."
154,Same here...zero times available.
155,"> Bonus if you check in with your elderly neighbors and get necessities for them in your order.

This, very much. If you have contact with those around you who are also in need of groceries and you place a communal order it means one, albeit bigger, trip for the delivery person in exchange for so many people not wandering around the store for nobody-knows-what-reason."
156,"Probably not directly enact wage requirements but enough pressure from local officials can change what the company pays. They can also just revoke tax exemptions, insurance credits, ad spaces, existing deals w/ gov't like catering, zoning, etc. and kick them out if they don't cooperate. They can force the company to provide PPE and other non-monetary things."
157,"My girls and I have been having wine nights on Zoom every saturday night. It's low-key a blessing because we all have such different schedules and life priorities that it's hard for us to meet up in person, and quarantine kinda fixes that for us by forcing us to be in one place at the same time. 

Like the other person mentioned, a big handful of my friends and I play Animal Crossing so we also visit each others' islands. I love this game so much because not only is it a wholesome rabbit hole to fall down (spending hours just catching and selling fish and running around picking fruit & making a garden?? um YES???) but it also has that social aspect to it that's really nice to have during these times. For the added companionship I've also FaceTimed two friends while playing animal crossing so it was like we were sitting right next to each other playing the game.

I totally get what you mean, I'm bored out my wits and feel like I'm wasting my time too. However, because of how busy all of my friends were and how much easier it is to ""hang out"" now, and knowing that literally everyone on this planet is going through this too, I almost feel less lonely than I did before quarantine."
158,"We have a group Facebook chat of about 10 friends, we talk every day.

About 5-6 of us are all playing Animal Crossing, so we all visit each other's islands every day.

We've been playing Jackbox online together with voice chat and I'm going to get Tabletop Simulator going so we can have boardgame nights too.

It's obviously not the same as all being in a room together, but you gotta work with what you have!"
159,"* Daily 8:30 am ""status update"" video chat with my 4 best friends. 
* Living with my fiancé (honestly I don't know what state I'd be in if I was alone)
* Lots of Animal Crossing"
160,TIL hecka people play animal crossing
161,"YES, i feel the EXACT same way. not having any plans to look forward to, not having contact with my friends, and not being able to go anywhere fun is really wearing me down. Today i did Zumba along with a youtube video (it was from popsugar fitness), and it helped! the instructor was really fun, and it helped break me out of my sad cycle."
162,"I don't really have many tips but I feel you. I moved to a new city this year to have an urban life, go out, be around friends, walk everywhere. And now it feels pointless. I'm trying to remain positive and understand that this will pass, it's just awful not knowing when."
163,WhatsApp group chats are more active than ever and Zoom Wine Nights are now a thing.
164,"I’ve been playing Animal Crossing too! Only two of my girlfriends play and we’re going to set up a visit soon. I should start suggesting more FaceTime or video calls; the idea of a wine night sounds super fun! I feel like I was thinking this all wouldn’t last long enough to drive me crazy, but I think I’m totally wrong on that. 

We did a video call happy hour last Friday and then did a Netflix Party and watched the first episode of Tiger King together and it was really fun. I’ve been slacking on setting up these hangouts, maybe that’s where I can put my planning skills to use! Thanks for the suggestions"
165,How are you doing Jackbox? We did a video happy hour with some friends on Friday and it was fun! But there were issues with logging for Jackbox and we couldn’t figure out a better way to use it — were you streaming it from one persons account?
166,I just caught the Blue Marlin on Animal Crossing and it made me the happiest I’ve been in weeks!
167,"We go onto Google hangouts, then share our screen with the jackbox games (so only logging into our account). Sometimes we log into Google hangouts with a diff computer so we can chat too! It works pretty well."
168,"Our first attempt was streaming through Twitch and using Discord for voice. The Jackbox servers got bogged down and it stopped working after an hour or so, unfortunately.

We're gonna try again this weekend with Mixer instead of Twitch and maybe a phone voice app like Houseparty. We're just gonna try different things until we find the best option!"
169,We were doing it with Mixer and then everyone else was watching at home but those streaming it (not the host) would end up with a 20 second delay and we wouldn’t be able to submit answers. I’ll try Twitch or Google Hangouts next time! Thanks!
170,"Ah bummer! I read that Mixer usually has really low latency. I think the delay for Twitch for us was maybe 10 seconds, so it was doable but you needed to play close attention to the timers!"
171,"I know this isn't what you're asking but if you want that smell out of your hair, wash with dishwashing liquid then shampoo and condition it."
172,Thanks! I’ll give it a try
173,I can cry every day at work and no one notices
174,"Music is one of them,  but also I have more time to improve my drawings by sketching since I have more free time."
175,"THis is a weird one -- friends?

I haven't had friends for most of my adult life. Then I got really into my career and for the most part felt my social life was satisfied just by interacting with people at work and hanging out with my boyfriend, his friends, and my family.

But I've made closer friends at my job this year. So now that's it's quarantine-time -- we are video chatting socially and just constantly connecting in a way we never did before because I knew I would just see them at work. And in a short time, I've developed a friendship with one woman in particular and I'm just excited to have friends. How strange that in a time of social isolation, I finally stopped socially isolating myself."
176,"Exercising! It feels so good to move my body after sitting around inside all day. Either taking my dog for a walk or playing Ring Fit. Also, Jenna Marbles."
177,"Reading. I used to read a lot as a kid but as I’ve grown, between work and classes, I kind of just stopped. In the last two weeks I’ve been able to rekindle my love for it and have read three books so far."
178,Puzzles. I’ve never done one until now. It is therapeutic and exciting!
179,"Suddenly running is less of a chore and more of a way to spend time. I've gained an entire two hours in my day now that I don't have to commute or actually step away from my desk for lunch. Fill it with running. Away from people. Away from regular trails, because suddenly those trails that are usually abandoned are drowning with people with toddlers in tow."
180,started doing yoga by following youtube videos!
181,"I used to write fanfiction, so I reread everything and it was so cringey. I've been writing more since the quarantine and have been very proud with how my skills have developed and with how much I've learned about basically everything."
182,"I don't know about love, but holy hell do I appreciate things I never thought I would appreciate so hard.  

* my treadmill
* the size of my home
* my windows
* the cleaning supplies old roommates left behind
* my ability to work remotely
* grocery pickup/delivery
* webcams & teleconference software
* the giant desk chair I considered de-cluttering because I wasn't using it"
183,Been doing some reading and I’m thinking about learning how to knit but idk it seems hard lol
184,Cooking.
185,"I primarily make pottery on the wheel, and would only hand build if I reeeeaally had to. But since the studio closed I’ve been tying my best at home and it’s actually been pretty fun, and the stuff I’m making is neat too!"
186,My plants-- I managed to bring one back to life and it's doing so well now and it's probably only because I had the time to finally figure out what it needed.
187,"Yes! I have been 'deep listening' to albums. I used to do this a lot when I was younger but these days I'm usually so distracted by tech and I consume most of my music through playlists. But deep listening lets me enjoy the music as it was meant to be listened to. Phone down, headphones on, just listening to the entire album.

Edit: spelling"
188,"My ability to choose my own workouts.  I'm lucky to have a nice home gym that I've invested in over the past 2 years.  I crossfit and really do miss the gym, but it's been refreshing to be home and just do whatever I feel like for as long as I feel like.  

I've gotten extra sleep from being home more as well and that's been refreshing"
189,Taking mid day naps! I had forgotten how luxurious they are. Just a good ole nap. But make sure you put on an alarm.
190,"> What is something that you’ve started to love since being in quarantine?

Being in quarantine. Seriously. 

I have social anxiety (thanks mom!) and am constantly pushing myself to be sociable and do things with acquaintances/friends, which is fucking exhausting. I mean, I’m good at it and I’m glad to have the social interaction practice. It’s rewarding. But this has been such an immense relief, I can’t even tell you. 

I’m still working, but I’m completely alone in the office 99% of the time now, and it’s closed to all in-person activity; the door is locked. It’s awesome. I hate dining in at restaurants, and now I can pick up whatever I want without feeling weird for getting it to go. They’ll even bring it out to my car! And more restaurants are setting up online ordering! People are just mailing and emailing things so I don’t have to deal with anyone in person at work. I can avoid seeing my friends and relatives in person without even having to make excuses. But we can all still keep in touch fine with texting and social media. It feels like the whole world has suddenly shifted so that it’s designed to accommodate me."
191,"Painting! I used to paint a lot when I was younger, then high school got in the way. Now I’m painting a bunch of memes/silly stuff to put in my dorm/give to friends once school starts up again. P"
192,Reading!  I've gotten through 5 books in the last few weeks! (I haven't read since regularly since college so it's a big deal for me)
193,Listening to audio books and cross stitching!
194,The people I’m used to seeing every day. Didn’t realize I cared this much lol
195,"When I'm bored, I discovered that I like to find something interesting on my Instagram feed (selfies, ads, literally whatever looks cool) and challenge myself to do a line sketch of it. I'm no professional artist by any means, but it's fun to take a photo I see on my Instagram feed and put my own little flair to it. I've been meaning to start a separate account for my line drawings to put together a little gallery!"
196,Going for walks!
197,"I always thought I hated my job and hated working but I’ve realised I actually really like my job, I just find the mental battle of being IN work to be overwhelming. I have complex post traumatic stress disorder from when I was a kid and I think the noise of being in my open plan office and all of my other previous offices has put me on edge without me being able to pinpoint why.


My self care has improved drastically. I’ve started working out at 7am every day and showering. I’m drinking enough water, my house is always clean. I spend a lot of time staring out the window. I make breakfast and a pot of coffee and I’m finding solace in the solitude. I painted my fucking toenails with GLITTER POLISH. I can’t remember the last time I did my toenails. I’m sleeping better and my work has improved too. I’m cooking from scratch and generally feel so at ease. I’ve listened to 3 audiobooks in the past week. I’m so content.

Thankfully I’m fortunate enough to be able to do my job from home in the midst of all of this and hope to continue after the quarantine."
198,"I've gotten into video yoga for the first time (after 15 + years of classes), and that's going well. I also have been taking some time to bake more. I'm quite frustrated though with the variance in quarantine experiences, based on class. I live in a 500sq ft basement apartment. I don't have access to a yard or balcony, and I barely even have windows. If I lived in a house with even a small yard and some more natural light, I could live in quarantine for months without issue. But this really feels like being in prison, and it's only been a few weeks. Meanwhile, people with huge front and back yards and massive homes with multiple bedrooms are complaining that it's SO hard to be quarantined, and they absolutely must get out to go to the park and get coffee once a day."
199,Having the sound turned on on my phone. It's so useful.
200,Minecraft. I started a private server with some friends and actually learned how to play the game. It's way more fun when you have diamond armor and tools. Much easier to build stuff.
201,Animal Crossing
202,"The fucking rest. Years of stressful traffic parking, making sure I'm dressed up,  trying to figure out lunch,  dealing with coworkers. I feel like I can finally getting close to feeling rested."
203,"Hula hooping 🌀 I’ve liked it for a while but I haven’t done it much recently. So fun to get back into it!

I’ve also been meditating *a ton* the past few weeks and it’s been a lifesaver"
204,Working from home!
205,Weed
206,Is it lame to say my boyfriend? Deepened my love rather than started it though I’d say.
207,I already enjoy crocheting... But I'm finding I have more time to do it since I can't go anywhere.. in the last week I've made a triangle shawl and two market bags.
208,Not feeling guilty about staying in at the weekend
209,Running! I’m doing couch to 5k and every day I look forward to my run - you’re supposed to have a rest day but I just love getting out and running - I live by the beach so it’s nice to run along the seafront
210,"Not having to wear makeup has been FABULOUS.  I do all my work via phone or computer but never video chat, so I have been makeup free for over a week now.  My skin seems to be thanking me."
211,I read what people are doing on Reddit while I am still an essential worker and go to work everyday.
212,"Just being home, and keeping it clean and tidy. And having time off work. I love what I do, just miserable in the workplace I'm at."
213,I'm surprisingly enjoying the slowed downness of it. Was absolutely freaking out to no end when it started and the slowing down of life didn't help because it made my thoughts busier and louder.
214,"Personally I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing, but I'm also attempting to start some seeds indoors in order to grow some herbs! (Currently rosemary, sage, basil, and lavender - sage is doing the best at the moment) I've never successfully grown a plant, so I'm not sure if it'll work out, but I'm at least trying!

Also I'm planning to get a lot of reading done! I have a lot of Greek history/myth/Hellenism books and essays I'd like to get through, as well as a YA series I read in middle school that I'm in the process of rereading."
215,"Skincare routine (I don't care if my face is all shiny after), baking bread (because fresh bread good, going outside bad) and gaming (to connect with my hubby in other levels)"
216,"If you're getting into music, check out the band Tame Impala :)"
217,"To be perfectly honest: myself. It hasn't been easy, but I've gotten to know a side of myself that I didn't quite know was there. 

I now know if I am determined to do something I will figure out how to do it (e.g. i made a timelapse video with sound and editing for the first time! i figured out i can do crow pose on a feetup! things like that). 

This had also led to the revelation that I like exercise (well more than just playing hockey)! I have been doing some yoga, barre, and flexibility training :D

So yeah, I guess there's a lot more to me than there is to me..."
218,"Nothing because I still have to go to work everyday at a grocery store. Congrats on not being considered expendable by society.

Even then, I never left my house unless it was for work or school before quarantine."
219,i loove love james bay!!
220,tbh it's cementing how much i don't like anything.
221,James BAE
222,"Cleaning, but doing one thing a day. For example I'll do the washing one day or clean the bathroom another day."
223,Beading earrings!
224,"Doing the dishes is now a welcome distraction, and I have been staying on top of them for once!"
225,"Cooking and baking! I wake up early and to take some of the pressure from my mom, I cook for us and sometimes bake as well"
226,"Silence. All of my life (26 years) I have never done well with silence. There needs to be music, or conversation, or white noise, SOMETHING to fill it. I live alone and am a teacher so during all of this I have found I am actually comfortable and in love with the hour of time I take to myself to just sit in silence every day. I think I used to do whatever I could to drown out my thoughts (dark stuff up there based on past) and not face my feelings, but now I am learning to embrace them and feel them. And I cannot believe it has helped and how good it has made me feel."
227,"Yoga! I always had some excuse for not joining a class, but now in these uncertain times, yoga has helped me to stay calm and focussed."
228,"I'm playing Animal Crossing, cross stitching, reading and doing jigsaw puzzles to stay busy.

I'm focusing on stretching for splits and back bends while my island is on lockdown. I'm so far away from my splits but feel like now I have all this extra time I may as well try!"
229,getting my space to look just the way i like it. makes it easier to be trapped inside when it looks stunning
230,Getting fat
231,"I've been reading more, working in the backyard to make it summer-ready, drawing/sketching, and practicing some songs to finally throw more covers online ^^"
232,"There's so much! I love going about my day on my own schedule. I love staying in and only going outside for one walk per day. Love not having to commute. Love cooking and eating at home, instead of being dependent on unhealthy takeaways or half-hearted packed lunches.
Love just hanging out by myself in my own house. Love being able to get back into painitng, art is everything and I've had no time for it until now. Love having time to study, at my own pace. Love Skype sessions with friends and family, where I'm not actually too tired and stressed to be making any sense when I speak!
Love everything about it except the part where I got laid off, ha."
233,"Surprisingly, school. Im typically a procrastinator, since my course of choice was kinda a lot, but since I lost my job ""indefinitely"" due to COVID, I began busting ass through school. I was able to jump start myself and become super organized and I even made a ""super study guide"" for my national exam! In 2 weeks I will be a CMA, I've been studying for a year and COVID kinda helped me get a guaranteed job(s). Until my exam, I just spend my days writing notes, bullet journaling them down, and learning more every day. 

Guys, I know this is cheesy, but if you have the opportunity, please use this free time of yours to expand your knowledge. It's gonna pay off in the future, I promise. This is your excuse to catch up on homework, study that one tough subject a little more, and when the time comes you're gonna ace your shit. It's worth it."
234,"Holy shit, I love reading. Started a few days ago and have already devoured three books. I can’t get enough. My poor Nook is working over time."
235,Not feeling guilty about spending time doing nothing. Usually I feel guilty if I’m not being productive 24/7.
236,I’ve started sewing and I posted some of my stuff online and I’ve actually made some money so thats a major plus! I’ve also been listening to a lot of music it’s silly but my oldest daughter is 6 about 4 years ago I got a car with a DVD player so I never listened to music anymore I never realized until she started getting into music this year (she loves rock n roll) how much I enjoyed listening to it! I’ve also been listening to audiobooks while I sew so I’ve listened to like 3 in the past 3 weeks lol
237,I've never been one to love getting my nails done. But a local shop had to go nail kita for pick up and I was like it's cheap cute and I really want some fuck it?? When and picked it up. Loved her work!
238,"Fitness - it’s so refreshing to be able to put proper focus and time into it. I’ve done so much yoga it’s insane but loving it. Also started  jogging  again which is useful to escape the slightly busy house at times. 

My dogs - technically my parents dogs but they’ve definitely been my little survival beacons during lockdown. Being able to walk them is just a useful escape for both me and my boyfriend. 

Cross stitch - I’ve always enjoyed it but definitely love it right now. Easily spend 4-5 hours in an evening working on a couple of cross stitches. 
Also got my boyfriend into it which is really fun and satisfying to see him enjoy it so much."
239,"I’m hoping to one day be an artist and since my work is closed down, I’ve been doing a bunch more art. I posted some of it and actually got two commissions on it!! I feel like I might be becoming a real artist but my imposter syndrome is like “you’re not you just did some doodles!” but at the same time I’m really proud :-)"
240,"I’ve really upped my cooking game. I cook most of our meals typically, but my fiancé has been out of work for 2 weeks now and in that time I think we’ve gotten a takeout pizza 1 time. Every other meal has been cooked from scratch. I’m still working (I’m a nurse) but it’s been a nice way to bond over food."
241,"Knitting! I made a huge blanket when I was in high school, its still one of my favorite blankets. Now I'm making a second one. It's very relaxing and time consuming!"
242,Having a desktop computer with a monitor set up at a proper desk- havent had one at home since 2003 and it is nice to use!
243,"Feeding the birds! Every morning I sprinkle sunflower seeds on the porch railing and then my son and I watch our ""birdy friends"" eat breakfast with us. It's the best. ❤️"
244,I've been baking a lot lately
245,losing weight effectively
246,"Been getting really into all the curbside services. We don't eat out much (usual reasons), but have been more because of our desire to support our favorite restaurants.

The local public library offers curbside pickup. You request items online and once available, you set up a pickup day/time. They won't let you request board books online, so I asked the librarian to select 5 books for my 2 year old. What fun it was wondering what she picked for her.

Finally, just used the service with the fabric store. It's nice that there's a way to keep them employed (they're very busy), us with our craft items, and to keep them safe!"
247,"Cleaning/decluttering, as ridiculous as it sounds. I never had the chance to do any cleaning with my extremely difficult work schedule, so it's refreshing to have a little more time to put things in order. Today, I tackled papers/documents from my undergrad that I've had for years but never sorted through. It's been so nice to have an organized, lighter space to clear my head in!"
248,Cooking. I’m really figuring out my way around the kitchen. I just slayed some salmon.
249,I've been painting more. I usually don't feel the need to do it. Work was getting so stressful that I lost excitement for a lot of things. It sucks not having a job and I miss making coffee and learning about it but I really love painting this little wooden box I found.
250,I love working remotely. I get so much more done without the wasted car time.
251,I’m back into baking again and I’m loving it! I stopped baking when I got with my partner as he doesn’t like home baked goods and didn’t want to eat it all myself so I just stopped doing it. But I decided I wanted to do something that made me happy in my spare time and I don’t regret it :)
252,"I'm actually enjoying my own company. I'm not the most extraordinary human being, but I'm not bad either.

I also enjoy having time to work at my own pace, when I decide to. I usually have to be at work at 7:45 am 4 days a week, and it exhausts me. Now I do shorter days, but I work 6/7 days. And it's less tiring."
253,"Not wearing eye makeup! I don’t wear much makeup on a day to day basis because I find the act of putting it on and taking it off tedious and a waste of time, but my eyebrows and eyelashes are blonde so if I don’t wear mascara and fill in my brows it makes me look really drawn and ill. Now that I’m not going in to work or out where people are going to see me (except for my roommates but they don’t count), I’ve fully embraced my makeup-less existence."
254,"My nails!!!

As a /r/bluecollarwomen my hands take a beating but since no work my hands look amazing!!!!

I love the way they look for the past few weeks and I enjoy painting them while netflixing.

Oh and I'm also building a stone bench in my garden, I can't get too soft during quarantine (but I make sure to wear gloves). 😉"
255,"Not working. I find myself trying to figure out ways to never have to do it again, but I need money to live. It saddens me that I have to spend so much time on stuff I don’t even want to do, but I don’t know what I’d do instead."
256,Gardening!  I just moved into a house with a lot of empty beds.  I bought some bulbs prior to the stay at home order and plan to buy annuals after.
257,I have a newfound appreciation for sitting on my porch and soaking up the sunlight. It’s the only outside time I get and listening to the birds chirp and feeling the nice breeze is so peaceful. I never really stopped to appreciate my surroundings before this. I’m going stir crazy being stuck inside but those little moments bring me peace.
258,Played hours and hours of Animal Crossing and I’m loving it!
259,calling friends!
260,Literally nothing. I spend my days locked in and thinking this is worse than death.
261,"I love James bay's music so much, it's touching and unique. Also if you play the guitar, during the quarantine he's been making tutorials on how to play his most famous songs, on Instagram."
262,Otome Games
263,animal crossing!
264,"Drawing! I've always wanted to learn how to draw but never had the time. I ended up picking up art with the help of an artist friend. I'm not that great yet, but I think I'm making some progress and have been enjoying it."
265,Baby corn
266,Yoga
267,Learning anything really lol. Even enjoying my class
268,"I’ve been getting into Instagram. I used to almost never go on there, because most of the people I followed were also my Facebook friends, so I was mostly seeing the same posts I saw on Facebook. So I unfollowed most of those people and started following a bunch of celebrities and public figures. It’s really interesting seeing their stories about what they’re doing in quarantine. John Barrowman and his husband are doing LEGO, his hubby put together the Bugatti in like two days. A bunch of people from Great British Bake Off are sharing recipes. Patrick Stewart is reading a Shakespearean sonnet every day."
269,Doing yard work. Keeps me from getting bored and instant gratification.
270,Im starting to learn how to cook more! I made my first homemade soup today via slow cooker.
271,Making myself coffee and breakfast every morning instead of picking both up before getting to work. It’s been glorious and I’m saving so much money.
272,I’ve been loving yoga and morning walks! It’s much needed time off for me
273,Check out Dustin Kensrue. His solo stuff is soso good. His voice has been giving me goosebumps for nearly 20 years.
274,I’m feeling more creative now and I’m starting to make more music! I’m going to try getting back into reading as well
275,i started playing the guitar again! Fender had a discount for online lessons/videos and i was like eh why not. and i’m literally having the time of my life!!
276,"Making macrame things. Saw it on pinterest and figured I would like it because I like braiding. Turns out, this is awesome! I need to get a little station figured out where I can hang it while I work on it, then I'll be SET. But right now I just put on some hype music and dance while I braid and make pretty stuff at my desk."
277,Toasted Sandwiches. Sweet/Savoury. I don’t give a damn.
278,"Air's cleaner, everything's more quiet, I don't have added stress from seeming ""together"" all the time or from being surrounded by a sea of strangers who couldn't care less about me.

In short, my mental health has never been better."
279,"Myrkur is one I've went back to during the quarantine! Amelie's got such a lovely voice!

I've been taking my dog out on walks a lot more and trying to get back into baking again!"
280,"I work in a hospital so I’m not getting total quarantine. I love the camaraderie with my co-workers though. I used to work critical care, but I work labor and delivery now, we still get sick patients just not to the extent of other floors. It’s amazing seeing how everyone backs each other up though and comes together. 

I also dig that my fiancé has been working from home. I work nights and every other weekend so I don’t see him as often as I wish. It’s also funny hearing how he talks on the phone to clients/coworkers. And all the dog love."
281,More time to write my fantasy novel.
282,Journaling! It’s been very necessary to express some of my fears and anxieties. Also I’m really enjoying FaceTime hangouts with friends!
283,Myself
284,Organizing my vanity and actually sitting down to read articles.
285,Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I want to go back to my office and my gym and see my family and friends. I am sick of working from home and being all alone.
286,"Candles. I have a cat, so I'm too scared to burn them when I'm not in the room. But I'm sitting at my table all day, so may as well make things smell fragrant"
287,"I find I want to try dressing with more of a punk style, though I own almost no punk clothing. I also just chopped off most of my hair because... reasons... 🤷"
288,I’m going to start baking! Banana chocolate chip muffins tomorrow! I’ve also ordered the game bananagrams to play with my mom ☺️
289,"i used to go to zumba classes years ago but stopped because the main instructor moved to a different country :( i've been meaning to go back and actually bought a groupon. it's for 1-month unlimited classes but then... quarantine! 

so i started looking up zumba on youtube and i can't stop! i love it more now coz instead of doing zumba for just an hour in a class, i can do it for longer at home! i'm doing it for 1.5 hours monday to friday! there are soooo many good videos out there!"
290,"Here in Singapore we've implemented work from home, but not a hard quarantine. I've been using the time to travel home from the office to jog around my neighbourhood after work, and I feel healthier and more energetic than before."
291,"Honestly I’ve started to really love school. I’m having the hardest time doing the work but when I do, boy oh boy do I feel so productive. I’m just learning so much and I’m doing it by reading and researching on my own. I can do it and email professors and learn more about stuff because I can actually think on my own when I read the lectures sent to me. I don’t know, It might be the structure of learning or it might be structure in general that is giving me life, but I just really fucking like learning and I’m sad that one day I’ll finish college and have to work :( I just wanna keep going to school."
292,"I don't know! It's so hard! I work as a lawyer, and am working from home, but work is so quiet! So I'm really struggling to deal, as someone who is a total extravert! I'm trying though!"
293,"My company’s CEO. He has his problems, and has been frustrating lately, but he sent us to work from home when it still seemed premature, is taking this very seriously, communicating company policy very well, and has told the whole company that though we expect revenues to half, he is not going to need to consider layoffs for months. He really has been a decisive and calming presence in a time of turmoil."
294,Took this as a joke but just in case - you okay?
295,Haha yep. No need to go to my car on my lunch and cry
296,Preach! I had a tough day at work and all the pent up emotions just kinda boiled over. Resulted in a 15 minute solid cry on top of my dog. I’ve never been more grateful for wfh.
297,"I feel better about trying and taking medication, so I can gauge how normal I feel. If you’re experiencing variated moods it might be a good time to try something to help."
298,Totally relatable. I work in a grocery store and someone asked me why I'm not wearing any protection. I'm dying on the inside and outside
299,Is there a specific thing you like to sketch or is a multitude of things?
300,I JUST said to my husband “ I wish I could draw .. maybe it’s something I can learn during quarentine “.. though I don’t know if it’s something I could learn- I just don’t have it
301,"I'm glad you developed close friendships with people! Quarantine made me realize who my close friends were and who I will probably keep in touch with after graduation. Like the ones that reach out to me to video chat or talk on the phone are the ones I realize genuinely like me. 

I think people who don't talk to me as much during quarantine are still my friends and like my company, but it's more of a situational friendship (which is fine)."
302,"Oh god I feel you. My first reaction to the question was 'talking to people'. Normally I'm kinda solitary, but these days I attempt to call up old family and such, because I do not get my normal three times a week people interactions. I did not know I needed company or talking to people before, because it got covered very easily. 

I'm so happy that you have found a friend in this! I hope to perhaps better my relationships at least. Normally I talk to my parent a few times a year, not because we are fighting or anything, we just don't talk much. Now it's a few times a month though."
303,Just came to say I love your last sentence.
304,"> Jenna Marbles.

YES BEECH"
305,I showed my boyfriend the vid where she shaves her eyebrows and he enjoyed it. What others are good?
306,Jenna for me too! Love their podcast in the background while I do pretty much anything haha. Also getting into the elder scrolls online because of her!
307,"Super jealous that you have Ring Fit at home. I ordered a Switch for my bday, which happened to coincide with all of this pandemic bullshit, and now it's on backorder til May. Ring Fits are impossible to find."
308,Haha I rediscovered her too! Had to go back and reminisce on some of her videos from 7 years ago. But her new stuff is great!
309,Oh my goodness! I thought I was the only one!!! I've been binge watching her and Julien's videos and putting the J&J podcast or Twitch highlights on when I go to sleep! I can't believe that I've gone so long without watching their stuff
310,"Same, I just started the Mercy Thompson series by Patricia Briggs and love it! (Only recommend if you’re into werewolves/vampires/etc)"
311,I’m gobbling up mystery novels like they’re candy.
312,"If anyone is running out of books, see if your local library is supported by hoopla or axis 360. They offer ebooks and audiobooks for just a library membership"
313,Me too! I’ve made it through four or five books so far and I decided to reread the Harry Potter books since I find them really comforting and nostalgic.
314,Yes!!! I started working on a new one and bought some sorters and a mat so i can put it away without destroying my efforts but be able to use my dinning table! :p
315,My husband and I put on audiobooks or podcasts and puzzle. It’s soooo relaxing.
316,"I really enjoy puzzles but they're much better done with a friend imo, at least ones that are more challenging. Plus it's good bonding time, even if there's not much chatter. Take it from me - don't do them on the floor to spare you from back pain or take a lot of breaks and remember good posture."
317,"I love doing puzzles! My favorite puzzles that I have done, I have used puzzle glue to keep them for the future."
318,I felt relaxed and light reading this lol hope your runs feel the same
319,"Me too :) I'm doing the 30 day challenge with Adriene, today is day 4 which I did at lunchtime"
320,Me too! And I downloaded the downdog app it's great and it's free for another month.
321,Me too! This is the first time I’ve tried one of those 30 day challenges because I know I don’t have an excuse not to do one every day. It has a really positive effect on my mental health and it makes me feel better physically since I’m sitting down so much more than I used to
322,cringing at past work/self is a sign of maturity and progress :)
323,"God, I can't wait to go back to just writing fanfiction and drawing fan art again. I'm so glad I've got some days off coming up, I've got one that I've been putting off since this stupid apocalypse started"
324,"I'm with you on this one. Suddenly I am very aware of how lucky I am to be able to work from home in a comfortable environment, without distractions. Working by a window has made me lifted my spirits. 

Finding gratitude for the small, seemingly insignificant moments that I never noticed in the past."
325,"Knitting is actually super easy! Honestly, the hardest part for me was always starting the stitch. Once you learn the basic stitch, it's easy to go. Give it an hour or so and you should be good!

(i stand by knitting being easy, because my elementary school teacher managed to teach our whole class in about two days -- but it is easier learning from someone in person than a video)"
326,"Knitting is really easy. To start out on basic stuff you need to learn how to cast on your stitches,  there are two basic stitches that make up the whole process: knit and purl, and you'll need to cast off at the end. The rest is keeping track of where you are in a pattern, I use a piece of paper to tally rows. I can provide some info on all the basics if you'd like"
327,"would recommend trying crotchet if you haven't tried it already!  it's like knitting, but with 1 hook (so it's easier in my opinion!)"
328,I just learned how to crochet and already finished making a cute tank top with a criss cross back!
329,"I taught myself how to darn socks by watching YouTube videos and other online guides. Our crappy vinyl floor tears holes in all our socks and I got sick of digging for non-holy socks. I'm no good at it, but it's a nice activity to do while watching TV while my daughter naps. I even got a nice small box for all my yarn and the couple needles I have."
330,"Give loom knitting a try! It’s like a cross between knitting and crocheting, and super easy to pick up."
331,r/knitting is great!
332,What kind of stuff have you been making? I also primarily wheel throw at a community studio and have really been missing it.
333,"Oh my goodness, have you seen what is essentially the Great British Bake off but pottery!?! It's so wonderful and kind and relaxing to watch. It's called the Great Pottery Throwdown and you can find it on YouTube."
334,"Yes! 

...except I forget the alarm part."
335,"Hey if ya wanna try something interesting for your next nap, check out the [power nap audio tracks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqgHoSIyFRkBX2Dkw5Hk2lK8eAirtcYyS&feature=share) on [this YouTube channel](https://m.youtube.com/user/xd00d5) like the [35-minute power nap](https://youtu.be/6d5xIKrCn3M). 

I used to suck at napping. Always overslept, always woke up feeling super groggy. I've used these power nap tracks 7 or 8 times now. Still surprised at how well it works. 🤷‍♀️ For me anyway. 

Sleep, er, nap well!"
336,"Right there with you. LOVE the feeling of having no where to be and no one to interact with. My mental health hasn’t been this good in years. Of course I love my friends and don’t want this to last forever, but I’ve learned I’m a great social distancer."
337,AND I don't feel bad about declining invitations!
338,Twinsies. I'm on call for my job. There's nothing better to do in the morning while alone than to cross stitch and listen to audiobooks.
339,I'm the resident miner on my friend's realm that they set up due to this crisis. It's been fun creating a world together.
340,I've been wishing I had one these last couple weeks! What is it about quarantine that just makes ya wanna hula hoop?
341,"That sounds lovely. It is so rainy and gloomy in Michigan, but I have been considering starting c25k."
342,"don't feel bad, it's not because you're expendable, it's because your job is crucial now more than ever and people are depending on you to survive this. 

Imagine all supermarkets shutting down when nobody has been prepping, so many people would starve before the virus even reaches them, and looting and all that stuff would be 10xs worse, just because there are no supermarkets"
343,"I've watched so many videos of him on YouTube,  it's kind of embarrassing lol His cover of ""Simply the Best,"" is absolutely amazing."
344,Lol The man is gorgeous!
345,"I feel you there! I'm trying to get mine for ballet, and it's just so hard as an adult... Oh to be a child again 😂😭"
346,Hang in there!  Don't hesitate to reach out if you need help.  [https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)
347,"I was like that in the first week, and it was driving me up the walls. 

I kept reading about how good having a routine is, and how it's important during times like these, but I was too stressed out to think about that. 

I decided to go back to an old hobby I had for a while, and thought I'd do one part everyday and document my progress somewhere. I wasn't increasing my goal so it doesn't turn into a chore, just one part, if I do more, then great, if not, then I did what I need for the day. 

so every evening I'd do a part, take pics, post them with the day and stuff. 

let me tell you, it's blowing my mind how much this changed me. I'm in a better place now, and it helped me have a routine with other things too which is helping more."
348,"I've been watching those! I don't play guitar, but his voice and playing are so soothing."
349,Not op but let's just say I'm really glad my therapist has started offering phone sessions.
350,"thanks for asking. Today is a bit tougher than the last 2 weeks, but I'll be okay. 

The sun just came out finally so I'm going to go sit in it until my eyes hurt and work can wait til I'm damn well ready to come back to it.

Stay safe, friend."
351,"I do multiple things. Mainly redraw my cringey 6th grade drawings 😂
It’s fun to see the improvement!"
352,"Adding to this - you can learn anything! Drawing is a skill, people are not born with gilded fingers who can magically draw anything. It takes practice :) anyone can learn how to draw in my opinion."
353,"Start by drawing things upside-down! It teaches you to really **look** at the object instead of your brain filling in the gaps and telling you what you think you should draw. By upside-down, I mean literally flip the object you're drawing upside-down (preferably an image in a book or something that you want to copy)."
354,You could I was really bad at art in 4th grade but I kept drawing. My motivation was a create your own comic my teacher gave me which I didn’t use till 5th grade and I started drawing and I quickly improved. It took about 2 1/2 years for my art to not look terrible.
355,There’s an awesome class on skill share that will help you!! the key is to just keep drawing!!
356,"I’ve found it helpful to follow video tutorials that you can pause or speed up. I literally type in “how to draw [insert animal, character, etc.]” on YouTube!"
357,r/drawthisagain might be a cool pace for you to check out
358,I’ve loved taking my dogs to our apartment dog park. I’m teaching from home now and it’s been crucial to have “recess” lol
359,HEHUL YEAYUH
360,Oh hell ya!
361,I heard her voice in my head as I read this
362,All of her videos from the last 2 years hahah
363,The green screen one is my fav
364,Try the video where she goes thru her Tik Toks...I was crying laughing!
365,It was a bday present in January. It's the only way I started to exercise. I didnt know they were so hard to find now! It sucks that it's on backorder though
366,Omg I loved that series!!!
367,Omg I love love love that series!!!
368,Any good ones?
369,Also overdrive and Libby!
370,In Australia and some of the UK there's BorrowBox
371,How does the mat work? Also how do you stay organized with the extra pieces once you have say sorted them by color?
372,I'm doing exactly this! Also meditating with Headspace.
373,"Starting day 4 in a few hours here! I love her awkward jokes and innuendo, haha."
374,Idk the first thing about Yoga and been really wanting to try it. would you say it's safe to do follow along on your own? especially as a rookie?
375,"Me as well! Shes so great, I appreciate how chill she is and doesnt expect you to be able to do everything. It makes me feel so good doing this everyday. I just hit day 10 of the 30 days, and I know I'm going to finish it which feels awesome!"
376,I second Downdog!  I paid for a year subscription and it is so worth it
377,"Same here, first time for me as well. Yes exactly no excuse not to do it, its a productive time filler and makes me feel great!!"
378,"Thank you I actually bought the things I needed for it today and I spent some time trying to learn, I can’t seem to get past that first stitch! I’ll definitely spend some more time with it though!"
379,I’m trying to learn to knit and I’m having a lot of trouble with my stitches getting too tight for me to get my needle into them. It’s so much more frustrating than I was expecting!
380,I second this! Crochet is WAY easier (I’ve tried both).
381,"I third this, I learned it when I was like 12 maybe lol don't know a thing about it anymore because I just dropped it after a while, but I remember thinking it's easier than it looks

Someone showed me in person, so videos might be a different experience"
382,"I second this! Crochet is a lot easier and more fun, in my opinion."
383,I taught myself to crochet using Simply Dasies YouTube videos! Her videos are my favorite to date! I haven't tried knitting but it seems super intimidating!
384,"Planters! I’m a big plant person, and spring is here! I’m in the South so all my plants are just exploding with new growth, so I am inspired to make wobbly organically shaped planters (they look like women’s bodies, but in a maternal way, not sexy, like the Venus of Willendorf)

I know they won’t be fired for awhile, but it’s the thought lol. I’m really enjoying myself too, a lot of the time on the wheel I push myself to *produce* and *refine*. Im trying to hone my precision and accuracy and develop my technical skills as a potter. But with this break from the studio and the wheel, I’m feeling a more... spiritual?... return to the basics of pottery and ceramics. Just hand tools and my own ingenuity. Not to get too weird about it or anything. Pottery is my passion so I could talk about it for hours."
385,"LOVE.THAT.SHOW. I’m so grateful to the person that uploads it for us non-Brits! So wholesome, everyone is lovely to each other, and Keith always get so emotional about good pottery. 
It’s great!"
386,Potter and GBBS fan here- how have I not heard of this! Thanks! I can’t wait to watch it. :)
387,Ohhh so THATS the feeling I’ve been feeling! Thank you for articulating that!
388,"> My mental health hasn’t been this good in years. 

I feel that. I’ve always felt stressed, by obligation and have-tos if nothing else. Now, not so much. It’s glorious. I hope some of these changes are permanent (e.g., mailing and emailing materials instead of in-person interaction, and more curbside pickup options at stores and restaurants, and people finding out how much they enjoy being alone in general)."
389,"I wish! 

That's so cool that you do ballet! I'm like a clumsy hippo when it comes to anything dance related 😂 I want mine for pole and aerial hoop."
390,"I really appreciate you writing this and the suggestions. 

I have a kid, I’m a single mom, I’m on a very strict routine. Parks closed, beaches closed, no backyard, 87+ degrees, pool closed, curfew in place. Everyone is posting how it’s “safe at home” but no one is addressing how detrimental it is to everyone’s mental health. Especially if they’re locked in with little kids and no respite."
391,Literally just finished my phone session. Like a massage for you anxiety. Thank you counselors/mental health workers ☺️
392,"I actually work for a mental health clinic and, though I'm not impressed with the federal government during this whole thing, I am SUPER impressed with the steps they've taken to maintain mental health treatment through this. I'm happy to hear you're reaching out and utilizing the tools available to you and wish you well during these trying times. :)"
393,My moms a therapist and we’ve been quarantined together and she’s as busy as ever with zoom and phone calls with clients!
394,"That was me yesterday. I’ve been working from home since last Monday. It finally hit me just how much I depend on my coworkers for my social needs outside of my immediate family. My motivation to do my work projects and my patience for my toddler are nearly non existent and it makes me feel awful. I started opening up to my husband about it last night and ended up crying. 
Fortunately I already had a counseling session scheduled for today and although they had video appointments available I opted to just go in so I could get the hell out of the house for a bit.
My husband suggested I communicate with coworkers/friends by phone whenever possible instead of email/chat/text. Counselor also suggested planning and executing a couple of projects around the house that I know I’ll enjoy doing (or at least that I know will give me a big sense of accomplishment). I have ADHD, and sometimes it helps me to center myself if I burn off some energy by organizing something lol"
395,"Although I can't do much, I hope [this](https://www.aqua.org/Experience/live) helps, even a little. Stay strong and please reach out to someone if you feel like you need to talk. I like to journal when I'm feeling sad to get my thoughts out. And if you're feeling anxious, try grounding yourself. I like the 54321 method; 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, 3 things you can feel, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste.

Hope this helps and wishing you nothing but the best."
396,"Today was rough for me too. It’s my third week of quarantine and for the first time, I actually feel trapped. I took a short walk but wasn’t feeling it. I am unemployed, can’t work out (2 herniated discs) the way I want to, and overall don’t have a lot of direction right now."
397,Lol That does sound like fun. It's always nice to see how far we have come in certain things.
398,I’m going to atttempt !! My mom can draw really well - she had a scholarship to RISD when she was younger because in her art class her teacher noticed she could draw a straight line across a black board with no ruler or guidance lol ... and my brother can draw . But not this girl. I can barely color inside the lines lol
399,"wow
Okay !! Thanks for the tip !!"
400,soo if I start now I could possibly get this down by the time I’m 33... I’m gonna do this lmao
401,"Thanks for the tip!!! I’m
Excited to start trying now :)"
402,What's the name of that class?
403,Okay I’ll do that!! Thanks for the tips !
404, I literally just put her channel on in the background and it let it play through her videos. They always make me laugh
405,"Aw wow, I still need to try headspace, are you feeling the difference?"
406,"yeah shes great, she like a friend already haha"
407,Yoga with adrienne is perfect for beginners!
408,"I'm so happy to hear that! 

I think [this was the technique](http://www.needlesandknowhow.com/knitting/how-to-cast-on-for-knitting/) I used for casting on. Maybe that will help?"
409,"It definitely takes some practice learning how to loosen your grip and not pull them too tight! Learning how to keep an even tension takes some time. It's probably best to make them too loose, if you can. Then slowly try to tighten them up!"
410,I've noticed my first couple rows are always like that but they even out and get looser!
411,"I've tried both too, could never get the hang of crochet and I find knitting super simple because it's just two different kinds of loop."
412,What size crochet hook do you recommend for a rookie? I tried knitting once upon a time but never stuck with it and bought so much yarn that just sitting in a tote bag. I feel like the hook would be easier and it seems there are more things you can crochet than knit but maybe I'm wrong.
413,"Knitting is so, so easy, I promise! If you can crochet, you can knit. :)"
414,Ahahaha don't worry I'm the same! But it's such a great stress reliever for me! I'm just sad I can't get to the studio anymore! 😭
415,"it really is, especially with a kid since you need to keep them entertained while both of you want to get out a bit. 
we'll just all have to just push through until this passes, hopefully soon. 
I'm an introvert, but I meet my social needs through social media for now, maybe that could help you too. 
just change things around until you find something that works for you :)"
416,"Hi! I’m also a single mom and it is tough, especially now. The best thing I had to do to help get through this (so far) is to relax my parenting. The reality is that there isn’t much to do in the house and so I let my kid watch tv, play games, talk to friends etc. Homework is split into tasks twice a day and it doesn’t take long to complete, but it’s something to do. Hang in there and reach out if you want to just chat. Also, don’t hold back from seeking professional help if needed. You’ve got this! 💪"
417,That is the best description I've ever heard.
418,What has the federal government done to boost mental healthcare in our time of need?
419,"Oof. I don’t have any advice for you, but I totally sympathize with being stuck with a toddler 24/7. In my family, we always say “I feel bad for you” as a way of saying “your emotions are valid, and I hear you”. So, I would like to say, “I feel bad for you”. Hope that helps a little ❤️"
420,"There are tons of museums and zoos taking their programs and collections online as best they can.  I don't have specific recommendations, but googling whatever you're interested in should get you some fun results."
421,This is extremely good. Thank you.
422,Aquariums are so calming. Thanks for this!
423,Thank you for the link!
424,Yeah. Especially how much you've grown. I just look at childhood photos from kindergarten or Pre school
425,lol go for it! You won’t regret it especially cause art makes a perfect Christmas present or any gift for someone
426,I put my sketchbook away shortly after my daughter was born. She’s 10 now. With the quarantine I’ve picked it back up again and oh my goodness it’s helped the boredom. I’ve even gotten her involved and challenged her to a daily drawing prompt.
427,Drawing Masterclass - The Beginner Level Skills. It’s helped a ton
428,The best content! Their podcasts are really great too. I re-listen to the episodes that really make me laugh when I need a pick-me-up
429,Yoga with Adrienne is perfect for non beginners too!
430,awesome! thanks
431,"Sort of a rookie myself but I suppose it would depend on what size yarn you have in that bag. If it's worsted weight (or size 4 maybe?), like the kind you'd give to kids for crafts, then grab an H or I hook (aka 8 or 9). Really, you can't go wrong. If you use a bigger hook you'll just have looser stitches, or a smaller hook will give you tighter stiches."
432,"To preface, I work with state and federally funded clientele where we meet you in the community, generally in your home, to provide therapy.

[This goes into greater detail](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/covid-19-coronavirus/practice-guidance-for-covid-19) but I’ll list some main points:

1. deeming mental health providers as essential was the first step.
2. This opened avenues for different modes of communicating with your therapist that are not usually accepted; it began with Telehealth (such as zoom and later FaceTime/Skype) so that the therapist and and client could meet without physically meeting.
3. (In my state) Telehealth was broadened to include phone calls, though zoom meetings were encouraged.
4. Prior authorizations have been suspended in some states as well as extended pre-existing authorizations to allow clients to be seen during the crisis.
5. Some states are allowing clients to be seen that are not currently located in their home state. (For example, Colorado is allowing providers to see those clients that are stuck in other states.)
6. Some states are allowing doctors to temporarily treat clients in a state that they are not licensed. (For example, a psychiatrist licensed in Delaware could see a client living in Idaho.)

I could keep going but what a lot of this means is there’s providers out there that are doing the best they can to lend a hand where they are. Residential facilities are encouraged to refer out to intensive out patient facilities and with states allowing out of state or retired workers to practice, its opened up a lot of workers to assist where they can and take some of the weight off of an already pressured system.

Anyway...that’s my two cents."
433,"Cool, I'm going check that out. Thanks!"
434,Hey I do this too! I use all the content from both Jenna's and Julien's channels as an uplifter. Except most things are never as funny to me the second time around so I purposely don't watch videos until I want or need a mood booster and then I can binge them if necessary. They're so great.
435,"yeah I'm a rookie too, so hop on board :)"
436,"Oh man, yarn has a size? Never thought of that! Thanks for the thoughtful reply."
437,Well thank you for sharing!
438,"I feel this. It'll be 3 years since I graduated college this coming May. I'm also starting graduate school in May. I have one person I still talk to from childhood, my best friend I've known since I was 6. My friends from college all live far away. I have one I'm close to, but even she lives about an hour from me. I'm awkward with new people, so I don't really put myself out there much when it comes to making new friends."
439,"Meetup Groups!  
Discord communities!  
Subreddits!  
Online competitive video games? (this one is a bit far fetched xD) But the idea is if you join a team and you have something to work towards it helps you grow closer to a group or community. Nothing like opening up with your teammates.  


There's a lot of online social interaction that you can find.  
You could also put out feelers on r/penpals if you're looking for deeper conversations make a post about it!   


Look into some online therapy. It's healthy to openly discuss concerns like these with someone. Your feelings are valid. Don't let them fester and eat you up inside."
440,"I totally feel the same. I don't have people to confide in besides my partner, and occasionally family. I graduated college in 2014. I don't know if it's because I haven't really pursued many friendships or what, but yeah. 

Feel free to DM me <3"
441,"Same except I'm back in college at 26 and also can't speak openly with them because I'm supposed to be at a different stage (it's not been well received when I've tried). I just feel like I don't know how to connect anymore and like there's no place for me. It's really lonely and I'm terrified the next 50+ years will be like this.

But for all that, I think I'm a pretty good friend and decently fun once I get past my anxiety. Idk.

If anyone wants to see if we're a good friend fit (OP and beyond) feel free to message me."
442,"Hey girl, I totally understand where you’re coming from. I moved to a big city for work and didn’t have a ton of friends there. It’s lonely and hard not to have anyone to hang out with or chat with. 
You’re always welcome to DM me if you need someone to chat with filtered or unfiltered."
443,"I’m about to graduate undergrad in May. Not only do I not have any college friends currently, the state of the world is just forcing everyone to isolate so it’s not gonna get any easier to make friends in adulthood. I feel like I’m gonna be alone like this for a while and I just need to accept that fact and move on ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
444,"My people! I graduated in 2016, and it's hard to accept that just because you were able to form a friendship...doesn't mean it'll stick. You have to grow together too, and it doesn't always happen, even if you desperately want it to"
445,"I can definitely understand that. I'm 26 and back in college (I moved from Poland and basically had to start my life and college over since I didn't want to do what I did back home), I can hardly ever find anyone to click with since my life is in a different stage, I'm from a different place etc. I guess what that has taught me is that, even though we're social creatures, we first need to learn to be happy on our own, in our own company. Making friends as an adult is difficult, if you work with young people they usually already have friend groups and are not looking for adding any, but it's just a part of life as sad as it might seem. Try to make the best out of it, be proud of the fact that you were strong enough to move from your hometown for school and meet new people (a lot of people don't get out of their comfort zones!), you're brave! Those small things really do matter and try to remind yourself about this often. Life changes and don't focus on how 'easy' it was in college, look ahead :) I suggest you try meetup! It's this website where people organize different outings in your area depending on interests, age, jobs etc. Feel free to DM me!"
446,"I had a really similar experience, moved away for college, then moved away again for grad school. Now I’m back home but my high schools friends have al stayed tight and I don’t feel close to them. For a long time, I was distant from my college friends too, and I didn’t make a lot of new friends in grad school. I get it. 

I will say that now that I’m “adulting” I’ve made an effort to reconnect with a few high school and college friends, and usually started off by apologizing for not being great about keeping in touch. Sometimes silence can be misinterpreted, and people get really caught up in their own lives. Now I make a conscious effort to text my friends that don’t live nearby randomly, asking about their days, following up on events they’ve told me about in the past. I also actively try to put myself out there, even though being vulnerable is scary. I flew across the country to visit an old friend, even though I was worried she might not see me as much of a close friend as I see her. I try to be ok with that. I try to focus on quality - I have two friends that I’m actively cultivating strong, vulnerable relationships with. I guess my best advice is to put yourself out there with some of your old friends you want to reconnect with - or with new friends! 

I was at a large training event, and I’m really shy but made an effort to sit near some other people and strike up a convo. That was four years ago now, and I still talk to them. They aren’t my closest friends, but I think you’ll find a lot of people these days are open and looking for friendship. 

When all else fails, finding comfort in reddit strangers can be amazing too :)"
447,"I graduated a couple years ago for college and I feel exactly the same way. I have work friends, but I don't think it's the same as actual friends. We'll go to the occasional happy hour like once a month but I don't text them or chat with them regularly so it would feel weird to call them ""real"" friends. Idk how to describe it. I just don't have anyone to just talk to out of the blue about nothing, you know? I've never been good at making friends and leaving school has made that all the more apparent."
448,"I have coworkers I click with very well. I’m in a profession where it’s mostly men though, but I’ve managed to make some really trustworthy friends regardless. My “girl friends” are pretty much all male now except for 1-2 other women and it feels the same. I miss the feeling or having a big group of girl friends but I wouldn’t trade this for anything. Be open minded about who you interact with, you’ll be ok!"
449,You get over it again around the five year mark.
450,"About to graduate grad student, and I can tell you
 I know EXACTLY what this feels like. Just wanted to say you're not alone."
451,"I'm in the same boat! I haven't talked to my childhood friends in ages, and the *one* college friend that I still sporadically keep in touch lives on the opposite side of the country. I moved to a new city after college and to sum it up, it's been an incredibly lonely couple of years.

I've used Meetup, to some degree of success. It can be very hit or miss, but eventually I did make two friends out of it. We're not super close, but I'm happy to have met them.

With all this free time I have lately working from home now, I've recently gotten into casual video games (like Overcooked 2, virtual board games, etc.). It can be a fun distraction. Feel free to hit me up if you or anyone is into that too! I'm a totally new to gaming, and I have no one to play with haha.

Hang in there!"
452,"I'm in the same boat. I go to school, and I go to work. I used to go to the gym, but that's closed because of the virus. I haven't had a decent friend group in almost 5 years. It doesn't help that I think I'm annoying whenever I try to be funny, and I can't believe it when people ask to spend time with me."
453,"I am in the exact same boat. It's incredibly hard to feel fulfilled when you have no one to go places with on weekends and spend so much time alone. I kept feeling if I worked hard enough at grad school it would be enough, but I really just crave people open up to and goof around with after a long week. I cant help but question myself and wonder why I'm not able to make friends like other people do. I keep trying, but I don't know what else to do and its causing me to struggle with depression.

I know this is your post and I don't mean to make to all about me. But I hope you see that you aren't the only one going through this. We have to remember that this is just a small piece of our lives and things will get better. I hope you (and everyone else reading this) find what you are looking for very soon! *virtual hugs*"
454,"I'm still in college now, so don't have any advice to provide for making friends after college. But recently I've made a couple close friends on my own (without my partner or any of my other friends, really): a gal I met at a party and a guy from tinder. I hadn't really made friends on my own before (and sometimes get nervous spending one-on-one time with existing friends), so it's something I'm really proud of!

I think, for me at least, being open and vulnerable is the key. Sure, you maybe don't want to tell your WHOLE life story to someone you just met, but the whole facade people tend to play at the beginning of adult relationships is silly. I waste as little time as possible getting to the deep shit and it's lead me to some deep bonds after a surprisingly short amount of time."
455,"Seconding discord groups. Especially if they're about online competitive video games ;)  

Or just normal raiding. Gw2 has 10 man raids so you get a good group of people you meet all at once and several days a week. Which is how I kept being social the past 3 years."
456,"You’ve probably already tried it, but Blistex medicated lip ointment fixed a lip problem I had that literally nothing else even helped. I had an allergic reaction on my lips that also dried them out such that they were always hurting and just a mess. For months. Eventually I tried the Blistex ointment (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00166633A/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_Kd1GEbGM5ZFDN) and it healed my lips after a few days. Worth a try!"
457,"When mine get bad, I up my water intake (seriously, this helps with prevention). And then for treatment I use Lucas’ Pawpaw Ointment. Discovered this stuff while in Australia, but it looks like you can get it on Amazon."
458,"So I basically post the same advice on any chapped lip post but please please please       

DO NOT:
- pick your lips.  
- lick your lips.    
- over exfoliate your lips.     
- get toothpaste on your lips.     
- mouthbreathe."
459,"I've been using cold pressed sweet almond oil every night. It completely transformed by lips but don't forget to spot test first if you ever decide to try it. Also, drink lots of water :)"
460,"I find working in an air conditioned office makes them worse, do you drink enough? I find my lips get really chapped when I dont drink enough water. I drink extra at work to compensate for the drying air."
461,Are you sure you're consuming enough water? Try doubling your water consumption for a couple weeks and see how it turns out
462,I’ve had dry lips all my life but the ONLY product that has been miraculous is the Laneige lip sleeping mask.  It honestly felt like it worked overnight
463,"I would recommend you to use labello original, I used acne medication and made my already dry skin extremely dry, including my lips. I swear by that labello, it is very hydrating and helps a lot with chapped lips."
464,"try not to scrub your lips more than 3 times a week, the skin wont be able to heal fast enough"
465,"I usually have really chapped lips as well.  I recently started using the vaseline lip care in a white squeeze out tube and that was working pretty well for me until i lost it.  
Now I just use regular vaseline it has been helping my lips greatly."
466,"Shot in the dark but have you considered an allergy? Food, face wash, laundry detergent etc?"
467,I have lip balm in every corner of the house and just keep reapplying several times a day
468,"So, you might want to try the lipsense lip gloss.  It absorbs into your lips and keeps them hydrated, do that might be a thought.  

Also, are you dehydrated?  I know that my lips are the first to show that I need to drink more water.  I learned this after I did a gallon a day challenge for a month and really noticed a difference!"
469,"My doc once told me that dry lips were a sign of dehydration, so I try to stay hydrated, put on lip balm before bed, when I get up, and often throughout the day."
470,Any particular brand or it doesn't matter?
471,"I used to use labello too, but some ingredients in it made my lips dry out even more."
472,"I tried vaseline as well, but still the same result."
473,"I find the stuff in the tube usually has these weird grains of sunscreen, the stuff in the jar works much better

My lips were super chapped and cracking a few days ago, I just get reapplying vaseline at night before I went to sleep.  Intermittantly I used a lip balm that I bought from a Canadian handcraft company called Boreal Folk. It has very few ingrediants, the main ingrediants are Pumpkin Seed oil and Rose Hip Butter, Beeswax.  My lips healed pretty darn fast."
474,"Yeah I've thought it could be allergy for cold, but it lasted all summer so maybe not"
475,"I don't feel like, but that might be case because I have dry lips for almost year now."
476,Any brand should be fine so long as it says cold pressed.
477,its a struggle. i had to go through hundreds of stuff to figure what will work for me.  maybe a doctor can help. or retry something and make sure to not lick your lips alot.
478,"When I was growing up, my parents lived in a nice neighborhood with basically no crime. They were super paranoid about locking up.

And my best friend (now BF) grew up in a slightly rougher neighborhood - *not* locking the doors, actually forming relationships with the neighbors.

Guess where I've been safer?

Community activity >>>>> physical security."
479,"Locks for the windows?  An alarm system, or a fake alarm system sticker.  Getting to know your neighbours so that they can keep an eye out on your place is a good idea.  Makes me miss my old neighbour, he used to phone us sometimes to remind us to move our car off the street, because it was streetcleaning or snow cleaning, and you could end up with a ticket, getting towed to a nearby street (have fun finding your car), or sometimes all the way to the impound lot (it never made sense WHICH was going to happen)."

481,Cell biologist here. I run a lab and my oldest PhD student is 45. He went back to school at 39. He is a great scientist and a terrific student. It'll be difficult but you're never too old for STEM!
482,"it's never too late for stem!  all you need is curiosity and a lot of work :) fuck everyone else's naysayer opinion, because opinions are like... well, this is polite company so i'll refrain from finishing that.


i wish i had a good starting place for you :(


poke around youtube and see what tickles your fancy.


w/r/t the math, i've never found someone who was *bad* at it, just people who didn't have a teacher or mentor they could connect with on the subject. fwiw, everything up until analysis (post calculous) is the math equivalent of teaching you your letters and how they combine to make words and sounds. then you hit proofs and you are into the meat of it. most math instruction i've witnessed forgets to or purposely doesn't explain this larger context... which is terribly unfortunate... like learning to read but never knowing a book exists.



math is *not* easy... but to be fair, neither is reading until you learn. i don't care *who* you are or how ”gifted” the individual, there's something in math (many, many somethings) that are just going to be rough. if they haven't found it, they really haven't gone very far.


math is also a lot like work out: until you form habits and get what is going on and knowing that you aren't benching double your weight yet (or even expecting to), it's more fun to have *done* math than the actual doing of it, if you understand my point.



if you haven't already, pick up a bit of coding. this is invaluable and doesn't actually involve much of what most people would term ”math”.


fwiw, i am a developer with most of a math degree..."
483,"I was 29 when I went back to school for Cybersecurity.  I have a degree in marketing and was about in the same place as you.  

School has been hard but I do not regret my decision at all.  Currently working my second help desk job making about 1.50 more than my highest paying job before.  It is a rewarding career if you like to learn because holy cow is there a lot to learn.  

The way I started was by going to industry events.  That’s not so possible these days but maybe checkout meetup.com to see if there are virtual meetings in the area.  It will give you a better idea of what the industry is actually like.

Udemy currently has a sale so you can start there...or YouTube, or free code academy.org.  Our library allows you access to Linda.com.  There are many many free resources out there."
484,"Electrical engineer here. A side note to say that you might get told STEM has lots of human interaction and you might feel discouraged by that. BUT it's often interaction with people who are interested in the same things as you or at least working on the same project. I'm not big on human interaction and am a total introvert, but puzzling out solutions with a fellow engineer can be exhilarating for me. Nerding out with people with the same interests feels good."
485,I switched to healthcare even later
486,"Never too old.  I was 34 when I received my bachelor's in computer science.  

Check out your library and see if they have access to lynda.com or gale.com. Gale is online 6 week courses with an instructor you can engage with. Some really nice courses in technology including security, programming, project management and i think cert prep hardware.  It's also called ed2go.com, but that cost $. Lynda is full of courses from design to programming."
487,"Definitely not too late to switch to STEM! I switched when I was 27. I’m 30 now and I have a great job as a Software Developer. 

You don’t have to be great at Math to be a developer. Does it help with complex equations? Sure. But you’ll learn how to do that if you start with baby steps! I feel like programming also helps you learn the math, because you learn to break it down. 

If you’re interested in programming, I recommend starting with FreeCodeCamp. It’s (obviously) free and you can get certifications. Building up a portfolio website will help you get noticed and give you something to show off (show those certificates and any personal side projects you’re working on). 

There are a ton of other great programming resources out there. Some are paid, some are free. I’d recommend starting with FreeCodeCamp to try it out to see if you like it before venturing off to any paid stuff. 

I enrolled in a coding bootcamp in my city. It was $6500 for 3 months. Monday through Friday, 9:00am - 5:00pm. So much was crammed into that 3 months, but I learned a ton, and learned it more quickly than I may have on my own. If that’s not feasible for you, don’t worry! Plenty of devs get jobs without a CS degree or a bootcamp certificate! 

If you have any other questions, let me know! I’m on my phone right now and on my lunch break, so I don’t have every resource I can think of to put here at the moment, but I’d be more than happy to help in any way I can if you think programming is a good path for you."
488,"No first-hand advice but I used to work for a scholarships department. I saw so, so many non-traditional students in their late 20s and 30s working towards their Bachelors in a STEM field. It is possible, it’s inspiring, there are scholarships out there for you (!) and I wish you the best."
489,You should cross post to r/AskAcademia
490,"I started my ChemE degree pretty late too, no regrets. Love my job. If you want to go to Europe, plenty of the students are in their mid to late twenties anyway. 

I went the traditional university route, but my brother went to a trade school of sorts to become a technician/engineer in the energy field. It's industry driven, more specialized but he's pretty much guaranteed a job at one of the sponsoring companies. Maybe you have something similar over there?"
491,A lady in my program came back for her Master's in her mid 60's. Never too old to pursue your passions!
492,Thanks for the words of encouragement!
493,">most math instruction i've witnessed forgets to or purposely doesn't explain this larger context... which is terribly unfortunate... like learning to read but never knowing a book exists.

This! Looking back, I wasn't initially good at English either, but I had lots of supportive English teachers who didn't give up on me, meanwhile all my math teachers were indifferent to my struggles at best, or enjoyed intimidating students on purpose at worst. My dad was good at math and tried to teach me, but he put so much pressure on me that he was far from being a good mentor.

In terms of coding, I've tried some free lessons on Codecademy, and found them pretty easy and fun. I used to design web pages using HTML as a kid(I know mark up language is not programming language, but knowing I can pull that off helps me think I'm not totally hopeless, lol) so at least I know what I'm getting myself into. Now I'm making a list of Youtube channels and other free resources I can use before I start investing my money into anything.

Since you are a developer, do you mind if I ask one more question: Would it help my case during (the hypothetical) job hunting if I built a portfoglio of personal projects and present it to the employers? My biggest fear is them looking at my CV and saying ""WTF is she doing here? Did she applied to the position by mistake?"""
494,"I'm not even sure those industry events happen in my country, but thanks for the suggestions. Yeah, there are even more free resources out there now due to the pandemic, so I'm trying to make the best of the situation :)"
495,"Thanks for the input. Yeah, I'm aware of the fact that ""office politics"" are more or less inevitable in any field. What scares me the most is the ""nerding out"" part, though. I feel like I'll have nothing to contribute in those kind of conversations. Every engineer I've met so far has made fun of my math skills (their lack thereof, to be more accurate) so I'm very insecure."
496,"Seconding this. I talked to a bunch of my senior colleagues about how they got into computer science and tech companies, and so many of them had very different paths that led them here. Many started with non-STEM degrees but learned to code in their spare time, decided to do more, and eventually made it their career.  Quite a few of them did some dramatic career changes in their 30s and 40s. So it is not late at all!"
497,"Wow, I didn't even know bootcamps were a thing until I read your post! It actually sounds like a great way to kickstart a new career. They are expensive, but I've been saving money since I graduated college for something big like this, so now I'm seriously considering it."
498,Thanks for the inspiration. Good to know I'm not alone.
499,"Uhm, not really. Most of the time companies want young, inexperienced people to train, but they expect a uni degree nevertheless. Unemployment rate is too high, and career change, second uni etc. is unusual and frowned upon, unfortunately. Most people are stuck with the choices they make in their early 20s for a lifetime. Glad you found your dream job, though!"
500,Feel free to pm me if you have questions about lab work or types of programs. I combine bioinformatics type approaches and molecular biology approaches as well so lmk if I can help!
501,"Not every potential employer looks at a portfolio, but some do, so having one ready is likely to be useful. Some companies do only care about paperology (i.e. diploma and stuff) and basic capability, other ones care about what exactly you can do and will give you a chance if your portfolio is good.

As for the one about maths, I can add to it a bit more. I'm someone who should have gone into linguistics or teaching or medicine or something else of that ilk but went into computer sciences because I'd thought myself good at maths and the reality of it is that when I was in elementary school I've been doing well in most of the classes (most, because PE is a class too) but most teachers failed to challenge me which meant I got bored, did what had to be done, and then stopped thinking about those other classes. Now, I don't blame them for the fact that they couldn't adjust to my learning rate because they did have to progress at a certain speed and in most classes it means there's nothing to do for someone who's learning quicker, just like I don't necessarily blame teachers who leave a student or two who can't catch up behind if those students can't catch up and aren't trying to despite the teacher's effort as the amount of material to cover generally doesn't allow for pauses; that said, I detest teachers who take pleasure from failing students, you just don't do this shit."
502,"Definitely do your research and ask around if you can! My bootcamp was local, so maybe your city has one too. I’ve read some positive, and unfortunately some negative things about one of the “well known” bootcamps. 

They’re definitely a good path if you have the means to do so! When I graduated, companies in my city they had formed partnerships with over the years did mock interviews at the end of our cohort and some of us landed jobs from those mock interviews!"
503,"I'll keep that in mind, thanks!"
504,"My city doesn't, but then, I'd prefer to join one in Europe anyway. Each one is different, of course, but do they generally help you land a job afterwards? I even found one in Prague that guarantees a job, but I also know those sort of promises can be tricky."
505,"I imagine most do! But there is only so much they can do, depending on your skill set at the end. For example, my cohort was around 18 people, but only 9 of us actually graduated. So they primarily put their focus on helping the 9 of us find jobs. Once you narrow down your choice on bootcamp, I’d ask them how they help with employment placement at the end. My bootcamp eventually hired on a gal where that is 100% her job. She makes connections, she goes to career fairs, and she is constantly on LinkedIn to connect devs to hiring managers. 

For the one in Prague, I’d do a little more research on how that guarantee works. Wouldn’t hurt to ask them! Do they have a connection with a specific company that hires their devs? That’d be awesome. But maybe that specific company isn’t actually what you would want in the end. Quite a few dev jobs are remote too! https://remotive.io/ is a great place to look for some of those opportunities!"
506,"Wow, thanks for taking your time for such a detailed reply! Prague was just the first example I found, it's not like I've made my mind or anything lol. I'd definitely contact the institution before enrolling, of course. For now, I'll just stick to learning from free resources during this pandemic and see how that will go. Again, thanks a lot!"
507,"First, you gotta change your mentality because if you view yourself that way, you most certainly are projecting that image and reinforcing the very thing you're trying to change. Next, you gotta quit the I can't attitude. I know it sounds dumb but you most certainly can make yourself appear more mature. It's the way you talk and carry yourself. That will be what people see first so of you walk with authority, or insert what ever adjective you choose here, you'll be seen as one who has it, which will leave a more desired impression. Finally, wardrobe has a lot to do with it. If you dress like Forever 21, you will be treated like Forever 21. Add a blazer once in a while. Pull the hair back in a bun vs the ponytail. Get rid of the eye-popping looks for a more natural/neutral/nude tone. Wear the lingerie AND wear it like you own it. I personally throw a jacket/blazer over several of VS bodysuits, corsets and bralettes. You most certainly can do it if you want. Corset styles work for any height.  Ask the bf what he likes and go from there. I'm 5'5"" and those 2 inches make a difference but I get called short a lot so I'm kinda there and I hear echoes of myself in your post. Also, dye your hair. That can help too."
508,Why did they even close down polyvore? It wasn’t doing badly... sure it wasn’t the new Facebook but it was doing just fine. Especially considering how niche it was
509,I think I saw a recommendation for Pureple that made me download it but I haven’t actually tried it yet. Worth a look maybe? I miss Polyvore dearly
510,">I think I just shouldn't do this.

Then don't. 

If it doesn't feel right, then it's probably not right for you. And that is completely valid. 

I'm not comfortable sending nude/sexual photos other videos to people either. And I don't think anyone is entitled to them. If anyone asks,  my response is a curt ""no."".

Some women enjoy sending sexual photos and videos, and that is up to their feelings and their discretion. It's possible that it's not your style ""yet"", and it's possible that it never will be your style. *There is nothing wrong with that!*

 Side note--Is someone pressuring you into sending sexual videos?"
511,"Safety: depends on what you mean?   

Physical? You can't catch anything or get knocked up so it's the safest physical way to 'have sex' for most women. 

Reputation?   

Are you planning on running for political office someday? They'll probably be found or released and you'll be embarrassed- but lots of other people have survived embarrassment. 

Revenge porn is possible: if the person you were playing with decides to ask you for money or sex or more videos or whatever and you refuse, they may post your video on pornhub (you can get them to take it down) or send it to your friends/family/boss to pressure you to do what they want. If you're worried about that, then never ever ever do anything risqué or sexy online or in a video.  
 
Your body and voice may be more or less identifiable in a video: I have multiple scars and tattoos so I would be incredibly identifiable. Maybe you are less so. 

Regardless, there's a risk to everything and you have to decide if this form of sexuality is worth those risks.  

BTW: there's no need to feel embarrassed or guilty - it's perfectly normal to get horny (yes, even girls get horny) and it's also perfectly normal to experiment with what you're comfortable with. If you tried it and you don't like it, then you know you don't want to do it again - but there's nothing at all WRONG with trying something new."
512,One word: snapchat
513,"Thank you I learned my lesson and probably wont do it again. On a brighter note, I've allowed myself to try and explore something new."
514,"Thank you very much. Well, I've already did the sex chat and exchange the short video.  I'm a bit worried that would be shared online (which for me is frightening)..but well, same time as an adult I am I did it already and now I know better. Online sex is not for me, I felt dumb and devaluated. 
I think what i've gained is a bit of more self knowledge in term that yes I do enjoy feeling self pleasured yet .. as sad and complex as it sounds I enjoy this in a serious relationship, not exactly my reality as a grad student with a job and a rushed life rhythm."

527,True. I hate burpees but I could use this time to get super ripped instead of binge eating chips because I’m bored. 😂
528,Thank you!!
529,Thank you!
530,"You should check out their [website](https://www.fitnessblender.com/) which i really really love. You can find workouts you like by using the filters (difficulty, available equipment, intensity levels such as whether you want HIIT or low intensity)"
531,No problem!
532,"In my hardest days, I felt similarly. I experienced a really traumatic event and I decided that I had to do something drastic to get to where I wanted to be in life. It was kind of a now or never moment for me and looking back I can't believe how brave I was, but at the time, I needed it so badly. I moved 10 hours away to a very low cost of living area, worked, went to school and really worked hard and was rewarded. The change of scenery and living somewhere where I knew no one, pushed me out of my comfort zone and allowed me a chance to find what I really care about in life."
533,"Honestly. Take it day by day. I have the Moodnotes app, and the gratitude app and they’re great. I was very depressed after being already depressed in a new city, then hid from an active shooter, while trying to start a brand new job out of school in the OR on the trauma team. Literally day by day. Cried myself to sleep. Cried in the work bathrooms. Cried before work. Cried on my days off. Even begged my parents to send me to an in patient treatment center. I wanted to kill my self so badly. I promise it gets better. I’m not going to tell you it happens overnight, it really doesn’t. Especially during a pandemic. DM me if you ever want to. It gets better if you put in the work, even just a little at a time 💕"
534,Thank you!
535,Thank you so much! I really appreciate it.
536,"Weight is a tricky thing to estimate when you are still growing-I was hungry all the time when I was your age. Typically you should go for calories in< calories out, but when you are growing it is very hard to estimate how many calories you burn while resting. So what you have to do is listen to you body, eat a 100 calorie snack when you are hungry, then don’t eat again until you are actually hungry (not bored). Also, cut out empty calories like soda (gives you calories but doesn’t make you feel full). Try to reduce your sugar intake (but you don’t need to totally cut it out). Also, to make it easier, you might be able to do something when you want to eat but you’re not actually hungry, like make tea or chew gum."
537,"Well I don’t know how you can prevent yourself from eating, but for exercise check out the YT channel Koboko fitness she is really motivational and age appropriate. She has all kinds of at home exercises for girls. Good luck 👍"
538,"Start where you are.Eat Protein. An egg with toast and yogurt for breakfast will keep you feeling full.Skip the sweets if you can. They just make you always hungry.Read the back of the packages for recommended portions. If it says 21 potato chips...then count out 21 potato chips.Put food in smaller bowls or plates to make your meals look bigger.Find a friend or relative to help you stick with it. They must not be the type to insult, but encourage and not get you down when you fall off the plan.Keep a bag of almonds in your food cupboard. Grab one handful when you feel hungry. That will buy you a few hours.Portion sizes. Look at the palm of your hand. Cup your hand. That is your portion size.Vegetables are your friend.

Use what you have.Use that treadmill. You don't have to go for an hour. Do 5, then 10, then 15 minutes and continue building up each day. And do one exercizy thing each day. Go outsie for a walk on good days, treadmill with the television on bad days. And you got dogs? Cool. Take 'em for a walk.Do half those things and I will bet you the weight will come down.ps. Everybody is hungry at 12 years old.Oh and your aunt is not a good cook? You got google and the internet...there are PLENTY of good cooking resources all over the place!Now get to it and feel good about yourself no matter what."
539,"What is your height?

Please be careful of random creeps sending you private messages. It’s not so safe for you to be sharing your age :("
540,"Adding on to this: if you’re hungry, try drinking water first. Sometimes we think we’re hungry when we’re dehydrated."
541,"Don't.  Once it's out there, it ain't never coming back."
542,"Just like with normal selfies, it takes practice. Get in front of a mirror, tidy up the background, and experiment. 

I would leave your face out of the photos, or crop it out later. Doesn't hurt to be careful."
543,"The biggest thing I think everyone has heard by now is to NOT PUT YOU FACE OR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT IDENTIFY YOU such as unusual birthmarks or tattoos etc. But aside from that it's really all about having fun! 

I personally don't like taking full-on nude shots and prefer things like taking a photo of my breasts as I cover my nipples with my hands.

A bit of cleavage and some lip-biting can be really hot too (just make sure it's not obvious it's you and no full face just a but of lips). My favorite places to take shots are: lying in my bed and in front of a mirror

Good luck!!"
544,I’ve just accepted the fact that my boyfriend isn’t gonna care that my thigh looks weird or whatever. He’s just exited to see boobies lol. Also videos is a good way to go around the whole FaceTune thing. It’s really hard to photoshop a video. You can always go on nsfw subreddit to get inspo for poses And then just play around with them.
545,"Just try out different angles to see what is most flattering for you.
Popping out your hip and a well placed arm on, or over the boobs is a good one"
546,"Don't forget to make use of the timer on the front facing camera. That way you can back up, not worry about twisting your arm around in a weird way. You can prop your phone up too to help."
547,"I read somewhere that you could add a watermark with the name of the one who receives the pic. 

It doesn't protect your pic from being shared, but it does help identify the ""leaker"" (pun intended!)."
548,"This is her fiancé. I think we can assume it’s someone who she trusts with her privacy. 

Although, do have a short talk OP about whether you’re each allowed to save your photos, only on your phone through text or snapchat or something, or will you also use your email/laptop/work computer, putting them in a hidden folder, not showing anyone without permission. 95% chance you’re both on the same page, but it’s good to get it said aloud."
549,i completely trust him with my life- even if we broke up i know he would never attack me like that!!!

551,honestly you’re so right. i know he doesn’t see my body like i do!! thank you 💕💕
552,okay thank you !!!! 💕💕
553,yeah i think we’ll probably send them over snapchat chats so they can be saved there privately!
554,"You shouldn't even trust yourself completely, you never ever know what can happen. Perhaps he'll suddenly be mentally instable for a while and decide to upload them online on some  revenge porn site. Perhaps his phone is stolen. etc. At least if you still wanna go for it never show your face/hair and choose a neutral background. I'm sure girls here who are advising you not to do it used to think like you but had a bad experience :)"
555,I didn't realize people's ear holes closed up so fast? I didn't wear earrings for probably a year or so straight and they never closed up.
556,Aaand I just now realized that I haven’t worn earrings in two weeks since I started working from home. Needed this reminder!
557,Interesting! Is it a normal to have ear holes stay open? I got an industrial ~15 years ago and stopped wearing jewelry in it maybe 10 years ago. I just tried and it's still open! Although it definitely didn't like me jamming metal in it.
558,Am I the only human being on here that just never takes her earrings out? It feels so weird to sleep without them..
559,"You could just get some [sleeper earrings](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sterling-Silver-Sleepers-Earrings-Australia/dp/B01L677TUY) and put them in whenever you're home. They're cheap as hell, are made to be small and unobtrusive so they don't get in the way, and they keep your piercing holes open."
560,I have the exact opposite problem. Ok not really a problem but experience. I've had my first set of holes since I was 8 days old. My second set since I was 12 (I'm almost 27) haven't worn earrings literally in years. I tried some for the first time last week and they still go in. Gonna have these holes FOREVER
561,"Thanks for sharing! I realised to do this earlier today and had to take them out after a few hours because my ears started to swell slightly... Ugh.

At least they haven't closed yet!"
562,I actually did the same thing last night. The back of one had closed and I had to push the earring though... was gross but going to just keep them in now
563,I wear my black spikes every fucking day. When I had a nose piercing that shit came out overnight and it was closed up the next morning
564,OMG babe thank you so much for this - had mine pierced 15 years ago and I just had to FORCE studs in after not wearing earrings for a few weeks! They would have closed completely if I hadn't seen this post! ❤️
565,I just wore some today -- it was an immediate mood booster!
566,"Ah damn. I forgot to put my earrings in the last 20 years and now I can’t get them in. Why couldn’t you post this sooner?

Srs I had my ears pierced when I was 8 and now I’m 28. I’m so lazy with earrings, I have been procrastinating getting them re-pierced the last 2 decades"
567,"I almost never wear earrings anymore, except in my cartilage (a hoop in one and an industrial/scaffold in the other). I have 3 lobe holes in each ear.

A year or two ago I gave up on the top of the 3 in one side, it's much closer to the cartilage than the others and it's always given me issues. The others stay open pretty well without me having to try much (seriously like once a year I will wear earrings for an evening).

About 6 months ago I was researching daith piercings for migraines and decided to stab through it again. I got it open! I wore earrings daily for a month or two to get it to heal properly without closing up this time.

I should make sure he's still open..."
568,"I've had 8 (6 lobe, 2 cartilage) ear piercings. Now I have 2 small-ish (8g?) Spirals in my lobes. I can't be bothered trying to keep up with all the studs, occasionally having to repierce, etc"
569,"I just keep tiny stainless steel posts in all of mine, at all times unless I want to change them to something else.

570,Oh another note if you have longish bangs don’t forget to leave them out of your ponytail or bun every so often!! I realized my bangs were getting funny after a week!
571,"Interesting, I never take my earrings off"
572,"Local pharmacies usually have small sleeper hoops available, since they’re essential services, and currently open, grabbing a pair to wear all the time is a good idea.

Mine stay in all the time unless I need to wear fancier earrings."
573,Yes! This has happened to me a few times and when I’m putting an earring in for the first time in a while it almost feels like I’m re-piercing it lol.
574,"I think there was a time I went a year without earrings? My mom was scared my ear holes would close up, but surprisingly they didn't. I usually just keep a stud in nowadays because if there's nothing there, I forget to put earrings in!"
575,my ears must be weird but i haven’t worn earrings in like a year and they still haven’t close. i’ve went two years without them and they didn’t close 😭
576,Its funny I started wearing earrings some days ago because I want to feel and look prettier at home for myself and my boyfriend. Recommended!
577,This is especially true for folks like me that have huge ear holes. My close up by a MM or more every 4 ish or so days.
578,I don’t have any piercings and this whole thread is wild to me...
579,"I got my ears pierced when I was 5 and I didn't wear earrings from age 14-20 and when I tried to put in earrings again they slid right in, lol."
580,You girls have super healing powers! There's no way my holes will close. Ever.
581,I don’t think I’ve worn earrings in my firsts for a few years honestly. I only wear them in my seconds because I can’t take them out
582,I’m eagerly awaiting my purchase from bodyartforms.com l figure I may as well have fun with various earrings/nose ring. I can wear something fun at home that I can’t normally wear to work. Yay!
583,When I was young my piercings wouldn't close up but now if I wear earrings I have to pierce the back skin again after like two weeks. Makes for a fun time when I only wear them about once a year.
584,Mine sometimes close overnight. Am I the only one?
585,"Jokes on you, when you get your ears pierced as a baby they never close up!"
586,I don’t wear earrings because of my allergy to nickel. I mean even wearing my favorite jeans is rough and it sucks. I’ve yet to find good earrings that are affordable but nickel free. If anyone knows any please let me know!! And if you know how to help with a nickel allergy then please let me know too! I hate not being able to have certain things because of it
587,"I keep forgetting to wear plugs.  It hasn't been an issue YET, but I'm waiting for the day I forget for so long that my ears shrink a size or two."
588,"Yes! I would only wear my earrings on special occasions and every single time my ears would get irritated. I'd usually end up taking them out.

I found a pair of studs and started wearing them on a daily basis. I alternate between hole piercings. Haven't had any problems since then!"
589,I’ve realized I enjoy wearing earrings for video calls. They add a little sparkle.
590,I didn’t wear them for a long time and now they’ve closed up. I don’t think I’ll get them pierced again but it’s a sadness since I loved wearing them.
591,I wish mine would close :( they were done with a piercing gun when I was seven and as my ears grew they became uneven.
592,I got my ears pierced when I was 6 months old. I only wear them every couple of years and they always go in just fine. Guess everyone is different. TIL!
593,"That’s such an odd notion for me. I’ve gone a full year without wearing earring and the hole will still be open for me when I need them.  

My nipple on the other hand I would NEVER leave out a piercing. Those suckers are notorious for closing fast."
594,"The last time I wore earrings to work was the first time I’d worn them in years - it was also the day the shelter in place was ordered. I spent the day moving furniture and boxes in the restaurant. Now I wash dishes so I can still have a job. 

I think earrings are cursed for me."
595,"GIRL I was warning my friends of exactly the same thing!   I left mine out for two weeks and I couldn't figure out why my hoops weren't fitting and hurting.  
I felt the back and I noticed there was skin covering the hole, so I forced it through on both sides.  It hurt but the sound was even worse."
596,"Ok and if you do have trouble getting them back in. Stop, take a breath. Get some polysporin. Dunk the earring post so it is lubed up good (I was going to make a joke here but I refrained). Shove in ear. The polysporin will make it slide right in AND it will heal any tears you make in your skin. 

I worked at a jewelry store for 5 years. We have shoved many earrings into peoples ears."
597,Good reminder! Thanks!
598,thank you for reminding me!
599,THANK YOU
600,Whew I needed to see this!
601,"I went for about 7-10 years of not wearing earrings, and wanted to wear them for my wedding.. I just kept poking until it got through..."
602,Thanks for the reminder. All good now :D
603,My earrings closed up and now they get bumpy and itchy a lot. 😬 Definitely a nuisance
604,Oh...no...
605,ITT: Everyone's body is different?!
606,You gotta get some sleeper earrings made out of Sterling silver or a similar alloy that won't oxidize and get nasty!
607,THANK YOU!
608,Wow really? I've gone months without wearing mine and they never closed up. I had no idea lobes could close!
609,"I had mine stretched up to a 2 gauge, so I’m not too concerned about them closing anytime soon. Good advice for people who only wear posts though!"
610,"Mine close quickly and a few days ago, I thought of this and shared it on another platform. Had multiple friends and family say, ""I totally forgot, thanks!"""
611,Wait I’ve been wearing them 24/7. Am I not supposed to do that?
612,"Yea that was happening to me over 10 years ago. I made the decision to finally “gauge”(making your ear hole bigger)?my ears and i haven’t looked back. 
I have these soft silicone plugs that i can sleep in and totally forget about. They are not big either they add a nice shape to my ears."
613,"I had this issue recently. I couldn’t seem to get them back in and was on the verge of just going to get them re-pierced, but I was finally able to get them in after a hot shower. The heat seemed to open them up more, and so I used one hand to sort of stretch the lobe a bit while gently wiggling a sleeper earring into the hole. There wasn’t really any resistance when I did it this way. They were a bit sensitive for a day or two, but they seem to be back to normal now. The sleeper earrings definitely help as I can leave them in comfortably for long periods."
614,"My relatives are doctors and they said that gold and other precious metals keep the virus longer. Therefore, it may be good that we are less likely to wear jewelry now."
615,My ears dont close up at all and i probably only wear earrings like 2 or 3 times a year.
616,I always wear earrings.
617,"I went 5 years without earrings but they never closed. Perhaps it's because I had mine pierced the day after I was born, in hospital (I dont care to argue the ethics of this, it was in central america over two decades ago)? My secondary ear piercings definitely close up if I dont wear my piercings so Ill assume so."
618,"The bottom ones on my ears never close up, I had some out for 10+ years and could still put piercings in! However the one up top of the ear does close in and get a bit sore, haha :)"
619,"Never count on piercings staying open if you don't wear jewellery in them! Everyone's bodies react differently, for some people if they've had them pierced long enough they'll stay open for a long time, but your body over time will try to close up and the jewellery is there to keep it open. You can get lots of very small studs or rings that are unintrusive so you can keep them in"
620,Omg yes.  Take it from someone who has had to shove my starters through my ears more than once it's not fun and it hurts.
621,"Anyone like me and allergic to metals? I have to take mine out regularly because my ears get so irritated, so thank you for the reminder!"
622,I got my ears pierced as a kid. Haven’t worn earrings since 2015. They’re still “open”. I guess it depends?
623,"The good news is, I never take my earrings out!"
624,"oh my god THANK YOU

i forgot"
625,"Thanks for that. I had a cartilage piercing I’d had done a year previously close after a week smh all of my piercings (cartilage) seem to want to close except the lobes. Putting in earrings now!

Edit: they all went in! I was a bit nervous 😅"
626,"I'm going to pick up my dog's raw food, to the wholesale grocer, to the hardware store, the post office, and to get donuts. (Armed with mask, gloves, sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer like a responsible citizen, of course) So, I guess you could say I have a pret-ty big and exciting day planned. lol 

I just put earrings in for the first time in many weeks, and it honestly gave me a pretty big psychological boost. I think I may even swing out and put some makeup on!"
627,Stretch your ears and you won't have to worry about them closing support quick :P
628,"On the other hand, quarantine is probably not the best time to re-pierce a closed/semi-closed piercing yourself!

However, I can't throw stones from my glass house, so you do you."
629,Mine don't close like that. I can go years without earrings and they stay open
630,TIL that people normally take their earrings off....
631,Woah I haven't worn earrings for like 2 years and then I put some in last Christmas and it's was completely fine.
632,"my ears dont close up, but rather  just infect everytime i wear earrings? i tried different materials and cleaning the earrings but nothing seems to work. any tips?"
633,"Mine have stayed open for like 3 or 4 years without putting earrings in.  When I do, sometimes I struggle a bit to find the other end of the opening, but they've never closed despite prolonged periods of not wearing anything. The people who sold me the piercings had implied that that is the norm as long as you properly take care of them and leave earrings in for the first year or so. I also didn't realize they could close up so fast after that."
634,Me too haha I didn’t realize how rare it is
635,"I didn't either. I've gone at least a year (probably closer to two) and had no problems when I put earrings in.  I don't know if it made a difference but the first ten years I had pierced ears I pretty much wore earrings 24/7, then my ears got super sensitive to everything and I had to quit."
636,I wore my earrings for 6 years continuously.  I then took them out for 2 weeks and could barely get them back in.  I even wore other earrings during that two weeks!  But the other earrings had a smaller peg
637,I got my ears pierced from Claire’s and they use the piercing gun. Never closed up and it’s been over 10 years. However I got a second piercing from a reputable place that used a needle and that closed up easily. Might have to do with that.
638,"I can’t go more than a week without earrings or my ears close. Have had to pierce one side 5 times and the other 7, at this point I just take the sharp piercing studs and squeeze them in myself.

For anybody who has ears that close super fast like mine, get yourself some gold sleepers! They’re little hoops that are continuous (the stud goes back in to the earring instead of sticking out and poking you when you lay down). They’re a pain in the ass to get on and off, but get some cute ones and you won’t have to change them often. They’re not expensive either, because they’re usually hollow (I paid $85CAD for my 18ct ones)."
639,Same. Mine dont close.
640,"Mine closed up sometime over 10 years of not wearing anything... Seriously, there's barely a dent now."
641,"Same, maybe it’s because I would wear them 24/7 as a kid."
642,I didnt wear earrings for 3 years. One stayed open the other closed. Tried to get the other repierced but it never healed properly even after a year of leaving earrings in and cleaning it every day. I just want to wear pretty earrings again :(
643,"I think it’s less people’s ears closing up in a short time and more people forgetting where the back of the hole is and pushing the earring in at the wrong angle and not being able to find the exit of the hole.

Speaking from experience... at least one of my ear piercings had two holes out the back side (the “miss” exit wound healed, of course)."
644,same here
645,"When I was like 12 I got them pierced, after maybe 4 months I took them out to go swimming for a few hours. Now I don’t know if they actually closed up in that time or if I was just dumb but it was taking a lot of pressure to get them back in (I probably could have given them a good push and done it but I was too squeemish) and I freaked out and gave up. Haven’t had my ears pierced since. /:"
646,"Mine seemingly try to close up overnight. The few times I (for whatever reason) went to bed without any earrings in resulted in a less than fun morning. It was so hard, and somewhat painful, to put an earring in in the morning that I’d never go two days/nights without earrings in."
647,"My ears will close up after a couple weeks and I had to take out my nipple piercings for an x-ray that wasn't even worth it and they closed up within a few hours, the time it took for me to finish my work day and come home lol. Sucks because now I can't get them redone for a hella long time because of covid haha"
648,"Mine close up in a couple weeks or so, even though I got them pierced 16 years ago. I actually had to pierce them twice because when I was 7 an earring fell out and I didn’t notice for a week and it had started to close over. My mom got angry with me that I wouldn’t let her just push the earring through :(

I wasn’t allowed to get my ears pierced again till I was a teenager."
649,I think I didn't wear earrings for longer than a year and my earholes didn't close either. So strange! I have really sensitive skin also and my piercings tend to close up a few hours after I've taken jewellery out. Bizarre.
650,Same here!
651,"Me either. It’s been 14 years since I have put on earrings regularly. 

I’ve also wondered if it has to do with my mom taking me when I was 3 months old to get earrings. The second pair I got when I was 12 did close up."
652,I haven't worn earrings in probably 10 years and just tried to put some on- no struggle!!
653,"Ditto, OP is a life saver"
654,It's normal to have them stay open and it's normal to have them stay closed.
655,"Cartilage piercings are less likely to close than lobe piercings, so that's likely why!"
656,I rarely wear earrings and only remember them closing once in my teenage years a couple years after getting it done.  Haven't work some for years and still fine.
657,Cartilage piercings close way slower or not at all :)
658,"Idk about it being normal, but I’ve had mine for probably 15 years at this point and only wear earrings maybe once a month. I’ve never had any difficulty getting them in"
659,I don't take mine out either. I got my ears pierced as an adult and now it feels weird not to have earrings in.
660,"I wear the same 2 pairs of pearl studs & diamond studs everyday and I don't take them out either. I take them out in the shower for a rinse and to clean my ears, then every month I'll soak them (excluding pearls) in rubbing alcohol to really clean them. Seems unnecessary to me to take them out at night plus I always forget to put them back in."
661,"I bought a matching set of small hoops and haven't taken mine out in a year. Only switched it up for a wedding last summer, but I don't see that happening again any time soon."
662,"I haven’t taken my top lobe hole earrings out in almost 10 years, bottom lobes have been in since 2016. They are both piercing studs"
663,"I have a few ear piercings that never come out (tragus, rook, inner conch) and the rest of my ear looks funny, so I keep my lobe piercings in.  My first hole in each lobe is stretched so taking that out is a no-no anyways.  I keep simple silver studs in the other two holes.

The only piercing I take out is my cartilage piercing because it was done when I was a child with a piercing gun, and I'm about 80% sure the cartilage is shattered.  I only put an earring in there for special occasions, and it will start aching after about 4 hours of being in."
664,"I still have the studs I got when my ears were pierced. I only take them out when I'm changing earrings, or to clean the stuff that builds up on them.

Bonus for me, mine are like the internally threaded posts used for other body piercings, so they have a ball ad the end on the back, so you don't get the discomfort from the post or back digging into you when sleeping."
665,"i forgot to put my sleeper hoop earrings in for about 1-1.5 weeks and my holes closed up a lil, so i jammed my sleepers in... ended up leaving my lobes super sensitive + swollen, as well as a wonderful pus-filled lump behind my right lobe which thankfully went down after a week. 

moral of the story: if you’re experiencing a lot of resistance, don’t keep on jamming it in. if you’re like me and your piercings close up super quick, you’re basically repiercing without a sterile sharp implement and with the blunt end of ur hoop (yes, ouch). go and get repierced when u can and don’t forget to put ur sleepers in, dumbass (@me)"
666,"I got mine pierced when I turned 7 (I still remember my dad crying. He was worried it hurt me) I’m 40 now and can still pop earrings in whenever I feel like it, which isn’t often. Bodies are so weird."
667,"My parents got my ears pierced before I turned one, I rarely put on earrings —also sure I didn’t put on earrings so often when I was a kid— and they never closed up. I’m 30 :D"
668,"Literally saaame. I’ve had my nose piercing for 4.5 years now and I wear a hoop almost 24/7, but a couple nights ago I removed it to do a face mask and the next day was torture putting it back in"
669,how do you change your daith piercing!? i got one ages ago also for migraines but have never been able to change the bar for something pretty. I bought some tweezer forcep type things recommended online but still couldn't figure out how to do it
670,"I can’t sleep in those, the backs poke me!"
671,"Same. I have four piercings, one set done when I was who knows how young, and another set I got done as a teenager for that slightly-rebellious-but-too-chickenshit-for-anything-other-than-my-ears aesthetic. I haven't worn earrings regularly in probably 13 years, but I have occasionally put some in the try them on or for a special occasion. The first set are always exactly the same - I don't think they'll ever close. The second ones sometimes need a little effort, and they're still squeezable (haha ew), but I can't imagine them healing up either. When people talk about their ear piercings healing up I thought they meant when it takes a little oomph to get the poles through, I had no idea they could fully just close up. The more you know, I guess."
672,"You’re not weird, my ears don’t close either. Do you want them to close?"
673,Same here! I use clear nail polish on the button of my jeans to avoid breaking out. As for earrings I haven't found a cheap alternative... simply just invested in 2 pairs of nice ones that I never take out!
674,Sterling silver and yellow gold don't contain nickel.
675,"I understand you're trying to be helpful here, but this seems like bad advice. I'd advocate going to a professional piercer to figure it out if you really want earrings back in, since they are able to keep things sterile. I just saw a post today where a girl's ear had swelled up to like four times its normal size (thickness?) because a piercing got infected, and the story was terrifying. Please be careful with piercings."
676,"Yeah same! I went like 5 years totally without, then another 4 only wearing them for special occasions. I had no idea people had their piercings close EVER after the first year or so."
677,"Mine are like that too. I pierced my second lobes myself in high school (stupid I know, I was being rebellious) and didn’t wear earrings in them for over 3 years and one day I was curious to see if they’d closed and they hadn’t. My septum though I got professionally done, and had it for a couple years. I ended up taking it out, about a year or so later tried it and it had closed completely. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
678,"Wait, this is rare? I was always told mine don't close because I got them from before I was 2 years old. But my cartilage doesn't really close either, but it's been over 10 years... I just assumed time. This is gonna bother me.

Google says... confusing information lol

Edit: english because it's bedtime"
679,My ear hole also closes too quickly. Yesterday I wore those heavy jhumkas so the hole won't close.
680,"I have three ear piercings the oldest is 24 years old, then 18 and then 10. My oldest piercing never closes up ever, Ive gone a long time without anything there. The two upper try to close up, the 18 not so much but the 10? holy shit have I fought with those piercings to get earrings back in.

The only evidence i have is the lower two were done at Claire's (it was the 90's don't judge) and the top was done at an actual piercer."
681,"My mom had mine done at 18 months with a piercing gun and they have never closed. My sister was pierced the same way, but hers have not stayed open."
682,"I don't think so, my first and second piercings were both done with the guns at Claire's, and they both wanted to close up for the first 5 years I had them. my needle-done piercings after that were all cartilage ones so that's a different story."
683,"I thought I was the only one! I’ve pierced my ears myself probably 10 times now and everyone always freaks out when I say that, but it’s really not too difficult with a sharpened stud? Just gotta be sanitary about it."
684,"Yep, same here. After like three days they start closing up, and after a week it's enough that there's significant resistance and I really have to stab it through. And it's been years since I had them pierced in the first place...

Totally second the sleepers, and I don't know what I'd do without them. It just makes my life a lot easier being able to leave them in and not worry about it for a bit."
685,"If you're in Canada I get hypoallergenic sleepers from shoppers drug Mart for about $25, they're not too hard to remove you just kind of snap them open and shut and they look super cute."
686,I have [these](https://www.amazon.com/365-Sleepers-Sterling-Earrings-Australia/dp/B076NT9LR8/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=365+hoops&qid=1585663207&sr=8-3) and they work great! My holes don't close up (after I found when my 2nd and 3rd piercing hadn't been used for over a decade and I was able to put an earring back through them). But I'm lazy about putting earrings on and off every day and just like the look.
687,"I have half a mind to order a tongue ring just to see if that will still hold. If I put it in every (roughly) two years, it’s all good."
688,"I had my first set of ear piercings done at Claire's as a kid and the lady did one of them at an angle, but the other one was relatively straight through. I have 3 sets + a cartilage piercing now and the angled one by far is the most annoying one to line up and I usually have to wiggle it around and readjust the stud to get it all the way through. There's been times where it's been so frustrating that I almost try to just punch it through because I think it's partially closed up, but I haven't had to do that yet despite not usually wearing more than a one set of earrings at a time."
689,I just got an earring through an ear cartilage hole that hasn’t been used in years yet if I leave a nose piercing out for a week even when it’s been healed for over a year it closes. And that’s happened on my nose multiple times 😩
690,The problem with those is it takes me like fifteen minutes to get them on.
691,Bactine really helps with the swollen/itchy ears when this happens.
692,"Latex gloves are a lifesaver when it comes to changing piercing jewellery, gives you a bit of extra grip on fiddly jewellery!"
693,"I had to have a piercer remove a bar once. It was just super tight and trying to do that action on my own head  was impossible. I felt validated when he had to get a pair of forceps on either side to get enough leverage to loosen the damn thing! I think they charged me like, $5 for jewelry removal or something. 

So I'd suggest getting help!"
694,"I still don't have one, just considering it. And really not understanding if I'd be able to change it myself is definitely one of the things keeping me from getting one."
695,"Hmm actually, thinking about it, it's likely because I sleep on my side. Or am I just so used to them? But yeah, hoops are better for sleeping for sure"
696,It sucks so much! I saw some medicine online for it but I haven’t been able to find it in stores. Curse having a nickel allergy!!
697,Yes I figured some out but I haven’t found any decent earrings yet I do have some necklaces now tho
698,I’m not saying if you need to re pierce your ears. This is “I left my earrings out for a few weeks and it’s a bit hard to get them back in” advice. If your holes have closed up then you should never do it yourself. But if you’re like the rest of us who have forgotten earrings during quarantine and it’s a bit tight then you just need a bit of lubrication to make it easier.
699,"I knew it was possible because I had a friend whose ears were pierced at birth, and when we were teens she told me they'd closed. But I legit thought it would take like 10 years or something like that! I guess it's just one of those things where like, everyone's bodies are different."
700,"I took out my 2nd and 3rd piercing in one of my ears years ago. And I mean 10-12 years ago (maybe longer - it was a long time ago!). And recently I've gotten more into piercings again and got my nose and tragus pierced and was missing my old extra ear piercings.

I thought they were completely closed up. I decided to give it a shot anyways and it took a little extra pressure, but they were still open (they were more shrunk in openness, but they were still pierced all the way through)!

I got some of those [sleeper hoops](https://www.amazon.com/365-Sleepers-Sterling-Earrings-Australia/dp/B076NT9LR8/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=365+hoops&qid=1585663207&sr=8-3) and left them in for a year. They were sore for about a week or two while they adjusted, but now they are fully stretched again and feel like they used to. I have sleeper hoops for my regular ear piercings as well, so I've just left those in for the last month."
701,"Well.. I had a time where I didn't wear them for a few months and they didn't close at all. I got my earrings when I was like 14 I think, so the age when you got pierced probably doesn't matter. It's probably different from person to person I guess?"
702,I got mine pierced when I was a baby because it’s a tradition in my family but it probably doesn’t matter
703,Heavy jhumkas really make your ears ache though :(
704,Omg I’ve love jhumkas! They’re so cute but make sure you don’t wear them too long!
705,"You remember a store called Icing? Mine were done there when it still existed (also the 90s, hahaha).  I am hardly in a position for finger pointing."
706,You can’t even feel it really. I sanitize the stud and use an ice cube as a backing (dulls the area and easier than the earring back to push against). Two seconds and done.
707,"I am in Canada, but I’ve reacted to the ones from Shoppers before (I have bad skin allergies, and some ‘hypoallergenic’ earrings have higher nickel content than others, if production isn’t perfectly controlled). I only use 18ct earrings now. They’re super spendy in Canada so I buy them rarely here, but every time I go back to Brazil, where I am from, I come back with a bunch of gold jewellery for 1/3 of the price it would cost me here."
708,"Haha, so true! I used to always hunt down a mirror when putting them back in, or leave a reminder for myself somewhere to for me to find in the morning if I had been out drinking.  
Enough practice though, and now I don't need a mirror most of the time."
709,They're tricky but 10x easier if you're wearing gloves
710,"ah well if you're considering it cos of migraines I would really recommend, I had monthly migraines which stopped for a year after I got mine done. Can't really see it when just a small bar so it's really discreet and I forget it's there now. I'd just like to have a pretty hoop in there now its healed. I may have to just go to a piercing place and see if they'll swap it for me"
711,"Ok, I can understand that. I figured that if it was hard to get them in, that would be your body healing, and I don't personally want to mess with that."
712,"They do :( that's why I wear them every once in a while, just to make sure the hole doesn't close."
713,Is icing gone now? It was around a couple of years ago
714,"Oh wow cool! Whatever works for ya, I never buy jewelry besides very cheap stuff, if I ever go to Brazil I'll keep that in mind thank ya"
715,"If it's the jewelry you were pierced with it might be impossible to get it out without tools, since they're often attached with tools. However once you change it to a captive bead ring it's much easier to get out by yourself (getting it back in is tricky but doable)"
716,"No. So often it’s just they don’t fully close, in fact even when people say they’ve closed and they don’t see a hole then a piercer with a needle can thread new earrings in. So they rarely all the way close (I mean it does happen.  I saw a lot in five years in jewelry) but generally they just get a bit tight and need the help. You could use moisturizer or something but polysporin will help if the skin does any micro tears which may or may not happen depending on how long they’ve been out. If it’s over a few months go to someone who pierces with a needle, not a jewelry store that uses a gun, and they’ll fix you up."
717,"IDK. Looks like they were just bought out by Claire's.  The one where I lived closed, and I vaguely remember them going out of business or something but it's been awhile and I was too young to care beyond disappointment because I liked the store. Lol."
718,"In the novel [Commitment Hour](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J90CH4Y/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Gardner, there is a community that changes gender every year, retaining the memories of being both male and female.  Each person is given the opportunity to give birth at least once before they decide to stay male, female or neutral.  One of the main themes is that there’s no such thing as “women’s work” and “men’s work” - it’s just work.  

Would it be such a bad thing for little boys to be taught to play at fatherhood the way little girls are taught to play at motherhood?  

The point of feminism isn’t to denigrate motherhood or childcare or traditionally feminine tasks. It’s to allow both men and women to be the best version of themselves, without societal limitations or judgement from preconceived gender roles."
719,"Maybe you’re enjoying being challenged by new things and being so busy? That may not be sustainable long term without burning out, but can certainly make the day go faster. 

And of course if the secretary work is really what you’re passionate about, there’s nothing wrong with that either! You could always think about going the executive assistant route. They make pretty good money and are a highly valued skill set while effectively serving as a right hand for a high powered exec."
720,"The reason your family doesn’t want you to be like them is because they had no other option but to be secretaries. They want you to educate yourself, explore different interests, and do what you truly want to do. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be a secretary! Nothing gives off more of an independent woman-vibe than choosing the career YOU want despite what others may think. 

The goals of feminism aren’t to have every woman get their doctorate in a STEM field, become a surgeon, or be the first female president. The goals of feminism are to give women the *option* to do so, so we can choose a career that best fits our life goals. 

If being a secretary is what’s best for you, then be a secretary!"
721,"I hate that we are taught that to do traditionally female jobs is bad- because I too love a traditionally female job. I’m a stay at home mom- and it’s my dream job. Before now I used to babysit and loved every minute. I love kids. I love raising my kids and I would love other people’s kids too. 
But I got 2 degrees and worked professional jobs in both healthcare and finance- and I worked hard. I loved my jobs there. But I found myself more fulfilled by being the one to raise my child, and lucky enough to do so- even though I made more money than my husband I’m happier now than I was with my fast paced job at which I excelled in finance and sales and even my time working with a therapist as an assistant. 
It’s okay to not want to climb corporate ladders, but I still feel like sometimes I should be anyway- I used to work so hard at that, and it’s weird not to be now. But it’s really a job I’m better suited to. So I totally get where you’re coming from"
722,"For the record, I'm a secretary.  A highly experienced,  dare I say, amazing legal secretary.  I think you should do whatever makes you happy.  But my two cents is this... theres nothing mundane about being the person in the background that gets shit done.  If it wasn't for all the secretaries and admin support peeps out there, all those suits with the fancy titles would be lost! You do you."
723,"Maybe consider hobbies or volunteering responsibilities that could give you a similar fulfillment?  

Honestly, life is just weird that way. I have a pretty good education and a few months ago I found out frying & serving fries and fast food is really a lot of fun. Especially if your customers are drunk. (My hair did stink for 3 days tho, that was quite a big downside.)"
724,"I've been dealing with something similar! I just quit my full-time job in an office leadership position at a well-respected tech company to be at stay at home mom to my unexpected twins.

My husband is traditional but also has found a lot of research showing how stay-at-home moms are really really good for their children. Consistent childcare, strong family connection, etc. She had always hoped that I would stay home with them, but he supported me through my own decision-making process. When he said that he was so happy seeing me enjoy being at home with them my first week as a stay-at-home mom, something in my heart rebelled against that. I rebelled, I think, because some part of me thinks I'm too good to be a stay-at-home mom.

I think it's a really ugly bias I have against it at home moms... And I never would have said this out loud. I don't look down on any other stay-at-home moms, and I seriously respect and admire all of the hard work it takes! for some reason, though, the idea of me being a stay-at-home mom and actually liking it, I'm just having a hard time swallowing it.

I partly blame mainstream feminism for this problem I have. Whenever women are raised up in praise for being successful, you see business women, astronauts, artists, teachers. You never see stay at home moms listed as a legitimate career option for strong, independent women. The idea goes that, if you are a feminist, you are definitely not going to be a stay-at-home mom. What bullshit! 

While I fully believe that the core a feminism should be enabling women to have the power and freedom to make their own choices, it's a real shame that stay at home motherhood isn't given a place at the table.

I'd love to hear other thoughts on this. And, if there are any other stay at home moms who have gone through similar identity crises, I would love to hear advice for encouragement. I am only one weekend, but I have really enjoyed being at home with my children, and I want to take pride in this and to not have any baggage over enjoying being their mom."
725,Feminism is about having the choice to do whatever the hell tickles your fancy!
726,"I get the same feeling. I teach full time, and also teach a college course at night. I have close friends who are in more creative fields, or more casual startups, and their jobs sound much more exciting than mine. It sucks, because they never really ask about my work, or seem interested when I talk about it with them, so it’s very demotivating. My one consolation is that I have a solid pension, benefits, and make the most money. (Canada.) just because someone else can’t see the fun in it, doesn’t make it less of a job."
727,I feel the same way I’m in the same role and my days were flying. Well now I’m caught up and learning a lot and now my days are back to “dragging” nothing wrong with being a secretary though. Lots of people out of a job right now so anything is good
728,"Im a college student right now. Sometimes I want to be a doctor In a really big hospital helping people out while geeking out over biology, sometimes I just want to be a fourth grade English teacher who has a lot of free time to do crafts and raise kids. I think it’s totally okay to dream of doing something more ‘mundane’ if that’s what you like! 
No one can force you to do something more ‘exciting’. Some people are daredevils and some aren’t, 
some like spicy foods and some don’t. That’s Just personal preference. Besides, those more ‘chill’ jobs give you a lot more time for your own personal hobbies. Plus it’s way less stressful! I don’t know why Americans (idk where you’re from but this is what I’ve noticed) almost glorify working insanely hard in a 9-5 or more. A YouTube i watch (Tiffany Ferg) calls it ‘hustle culture’. Sometimes it’s just an unhealthy obsession with productivity. 
Anyway, you do you. I’m glad you found a career you like!"
729,"Secretaries are the most underrated job ever. Though this is not always the case, sometimes they know more than their superiors on vital matters for the company & have powerful organizing, multitasking and prioritizing skills"
730,"I think you should do exactly what makes you happy!! I am a teacher and I. Love. It. 

Don’t let anyone look down on you."
731,"My favourite job so far of my life was working a very basic admin type job, where I had a list of things to do each day, completed them, and that was that. Never took my work home, never stressed about it. 

I left because I thought I should be doing more because I have a degree but I’ve never been happier than I was at that job."
732,"As a woman you're able to and should do whatever makes you happy. You shouldn't let stereotypes or sexist expectations hold you back. That's just as true for stay at home moms as it is for childless career women. Just because a job is ""domestic"" doesn't mean you should or shouldn't do it. You should do what makes you happy. 

My family is full of strong women breaking expectations, my mom is an engineer who graduated college as the only woman in her class and was also top of her class, my grandmother was a doctor during the 40s, all my aunts worked in male dominated fields. The expectation was always for me to go for a high paying job and that usually meant a STEM or other male dominated field. I'm in the process of becoming a social worker helping with drug addiction and mental illness. I want to help people and this career gives me so much purpose. But when all your cousins are expensive lawyers and doctors... its not really living up to the competition. It's not prestigious and will never make me rich. But it's what I want. At first my parents were upset because they know I'll never be able to afford the things they could at my age. They felt like I was ""wasting my talents"" or whatever. But I knew I'd be happy on this path and after a while they saw it too. 

That's all parents should want, your happiness and wellbeing. If you/your family is self sufficient and you're happy that's all that matters. Go for that secretary job knowing that you chose it, you weren't forced into it like women have been in the past. There shouldn't be any shame for it"
733,"Really interesting you say this, finding that I like being in traditionally feminine like roles in the workplace, like secretary/hr/teaching/manager, but kind of struggle with this as well as I don’t resonate with traditionally maternal things like being the work wife or mom friend who takes care of people... thanks for posting this! I feel like you put words into something I’ve been struggling to verbalize in my new job."
734,"So, I’m studying to get an actual degree so I can get a job to pay my bills. That’s not my dream. But oh man, my real dream makes me feel slightly guilty because feminists have fought so hard to pull women out of that kind of forced life. What do I want the most in my life? To take care of a home with my husband. My dream that I think of so often is cooking dinner for us (because I love to cook) while he’s in the living room playing our favorite video game and narrating all the cool stuff to me until I can get back with our plates of food. I guess it’s not a career since I don’t exactly get paid, but taking care of a home is my absolute dream job. And I feel so bad because of it.


Edit: just in case anyone wonders, my line of studies is in English Literature so I can be a editor. I simply love taking what others have made, and making it better, or helping them get the words stuck in their head down onto the page. I love helping people, so maybe that’s why I love the idea of keeping a home so much."
735,"I don’t think there’s anything wrong with what you enjoy doing. I haven’t worked in years for personal reasons (and yes I am unbelievably thankful I have a good living situation), but probably my favorite job I had was working the front desk at my college. I answered phones, sorted mail, had to answer in person questions for visitors, that kind of thing. I made a point of remembering all the ‘support staff’s’ names, the cleaning staff etc along with all the faculty, and I loved that when the school had special events I was able to help visitors find their way. One of my fondest memories is seeing the surprise on the custodian’s face when I had her paycheck ready to go because I remembered her name.

Your family may not have wanted you to become a secretary because they didn’t have the choices you do. But I believe there’s nothing wrong with choosing that over something else. There’s real magic when you have a job that you enjoy doing, and pride in doing a job well can be found regardless of what your job is. 

Go forth and kick some ass whatever it is you decide to do!"
736,"I'm struggling with something similar.  Im set for a big promotion this summer. And I don't want it. I've been a cycle of being an assistant then will get a promotion, hate it, switch jobs to an assistant get a promotion, hate it, repeat. I've done this 4 times now, and I've realized I'm a kick ass assistant. I like paperwork and don't like the pressure of being in charge."
737,"Thank you everyone for your amazing feedback. It has been super helpful, interesting, and encouraging to read! Your support has gone noticed :)"
738,"Everyone here has made really good points so I wanted to add that if money is the concern, as in to provide for your family, there are a lot of secretary positions that make more than minimum wage whether it's a legal secretary like one of the other commenters here or an executive assistant or another specialized secretary position like that."
739,"I would like to say, as a teacher, 4th grade teachers have no extra time to do crafts or raise kids."
740,"I knew there had to be other people going through this, that’s one reason why I wanted to post it. If you haven’t already, I encourage you to read some of the other comments. They’re very inspiring. Follow your heart and be happy!"
741,"A 4th grade English teacher also isn’t a thing. A 4th grade teacher teaches everything, all subjects all day (all elementary school teachers do). If you want to just teach English/Language Arts, it’ll have to be older kids, 7th-12th grade in single subject classes."
742,"Also, 7 hours teaching is by far the most stressful and exhausting work I've had in my life including much longer shifts and midnight shifts."
743,"They would at least have shorter hours that they have to be at their job. Of course there’s still work once you get home but at least it’s at home. To me those jobs can both be stressful, but a different type of stress."
744,"Depends on the state. In TX we have ELA 4-6 and then ELA 7-12, in addition to Generalist teachers, who teach EC-6, all subjects. It just depends on how the school is set up; when I was was in 4th grade we had separate classes and teachers."
745,This. 8 hours at a school is harder than 16 at a hospital.
746,"I would advise you to look up the rates of new teachers burn out. The work can add up to be 70 hours a week in some cases, with 30 of it unpaid. I guarantee you their current job has easier hours."
747,"I wasn’t trying to bash teachers. I appreciate every teacher I’ve had and they’ve told me how hard it can get. I mostly brought it up because in my culture, growing up with two immigrant parents, wanting a job as a teacher and not wanting to be a doctor or lawyer is looked down upon. I’m trying to say there’s no shame to want to do what you want, and what you want can change. 

Maybe the confusion comes where I said ‘it’s way less stressful’. I was referring to OP’s secretary job, and I meant to separate those into paragraphs but maybe formatting is different because I’m on mobile."
748,"Oh! And I should add that since you’re a teacher, I do appreciate you too! I hope that if you’ve had to make any changes because of Covid-19, you are able to manage it. Good luck to you and your students."
749,"Oh ok; I know you weren’t trying to bash the profession, but a lot of people think we work 7-3 and that’s it. So that got my gears going. But it’s all good."
750,"Thanks! We’re managing, but no idea how long we can keep doing it."
751,"I can be somewhat ignorant when it comes to certain cultures but I want to know whether your dad still gives you restrictions or is it moreso the causation from the past?
I have changed so many styles in my life. Sometimes I look back and say ""wow I looked bad/lame/embarrassing"" but I don't regret it. Neither should you, even though our cases are not the same. Your past doesn't define you so do whatever you can to let go of it. Another part is the lack of experience, which can be easily fixed. Don't feel pressured to comply with standards and go all in, instead just try experimenting for a bit. Youtube could help you a lot.
If it's makeup, let the foundation wait for a bit. Try to search for videos on colors for skin tones, and see if there are blushes out there you like, get some mascara, lipliner/lipgloss, eyebrow powder  and see how you will feel. Might be weird in the beginning. Then you can continue exporing.
As far as the hair goes, I would suggest you wear it down for some time, condition it well when showering and use some styling products such as hair moose. But that depends on your hair really, so do the research if you feel like it.
For clothes, I am not going to tell you to start wearing dresses. Everyone perception of femininity is different so, perhaps, you can try certain colors, add some earrings or bracelets, little things like that. If you really feel like it, try that dress or a skirt, why not. It will come to you in time. Again, search for videos on how to find your own style and let yourself be drawn to pieces in the store. Thrifting is also fun and saves money.
Make sure that you don't change yourself overnight, instead take your time and have fun with it. DO NOT do anything that you feel will please men. It's a waste of life. Also, DO NOT blindly follow trends. 
Once you start stepping into this whole new life, your confidence will go up and it will be easier to experiment more day by day, and will most certainly be fun. And it's never too late for that. I will probably have more transitioning phases myself in the future, and that is coming from a former heavy makeup skimpy outfits girl.
Good luck and I wish you all the best!"
752,"Thank for you the comment and for the suggestions given and for the words. Really, really appreciated!"
753,"You are more than welcome, I understand it can be more of a mental struggle rather than just finding a good blush. But I think you should start with these small things and see where it leads you. <3"
754,"I come from a highly conservative family and I never heard of the shorts thing. Granted, we weren't allowed to wear anything shorter than our knees, so that might have something to do with it. 

I honestly don't think it should matter if you're in your own home (unless she had friends or was video chatting) and if your butt isn't hanging out. 

My sister did something similar, though. I'm rather busty and I wouldn't wear a bra at home at my sister got weird about it. I don't get it either honestly."
755,I have never in my life worn shorts under a skirt. In my younger days I wore shorter skirts and would wear bikini type underwear that covered everything. Now I wear longer skirts so there’s no need to worry about anyone inadvertently seeing anything.
756,"People wear shorts under skirts? TIL.

Won't that give weird bulkiness? Or lines?

Edit: I get it, you all like shorts. I personally don't, if I wanna wear shorts I'll wear shorts instead of a dress. Look through the replies and give someone and updoot if they've said what you wanna say."
757,"It’s normal to NOT wear shorts under a skirt. I do it occasionally only if it’s windy or the skirt is a bit short and flowy, but otherwise it’s no big deal at all to not wear shorts"
758,"The ONLY reason I could think to wear shorts under a skirt would be to prevent chaffing from your thighs rubbing together.

How did she even know you weren't wearing them? Do your shorts normally show?

(And honestly my first question was actually if you are Mormon and it's an actual modesty thing.)"
759,"Like, it's not bad. You are clothed, you're not gallivanting in the nude. Unfortunately I am 99.99% sure your sister told you that coming from a place of trying to protect you from being sexually harassed on the street.

It sucks and society sucks as a whole, but that was probably her intention. 

You SHOULD be able to walk any ik your skirt without inappropriate comments or remarks coming your way."
760,"My mom made me when I little kid and didn’t know how to sit without flashing my underwear to everyone, but once I learned how to sit properly I didn’t wear shorts under dresses anymore. 

I do have some “long underwear” that’s very thin and mid thigh length that I’ll wear under skirts in the summer, but that’s for chafing, not modesty. 

I’m 26, so I did the shorts thing in the mid/late 90s."
761,"Depends on the type of skirt. Just remember that looking fine in your mirror doesn't mean it isn't transparent in sunlight or that the slightest wind won't make it fly.



I only wear shorts underneath if the skirt is both short and billowy; pencil skirts stay in place, but a flowy short circle skirt might kick up even just from the motion of walking. A few years ago, my friend's skirt got stuck on her backpack and she was wearing a thong.. A guy behind us had to awkwardly point it out to her 😱


Also, just as a matter of hygiene, I wear shorts if the skirt is so short that, when I sit down, my bare ass has to touch some dirty public seat. Sitting on an ancient subway seat full of literal shit bacteria with my bare ass? Noo thanks."
762,"You do you.  

I wear thin shorts under all my dresses/skirts to avoid thigh chafe (and I wear them a lot), but if you don't have that issue and you are confident in either your underwear choices or your skirts' staying down power, then there's no need."
763,"Ultimately it’s your prerogative, I refuse to wear dresses or skirts if I don’t have a pair of shorts to go under them for safety reasons. You said you were in your house not planning on going anywhere so I wouldn’t feel uncomfortable without shorts under my dress/skirt; I’d just make sure I put on a pair before I went out."
764,"It’s perfectly fine?

I wear shorts as more of a comfort thing personally. I wouldn’t wear a thong or something not full coverage under a skirt, though. 

Why was your sister looking?"
765,Uh no. It's perfectly fine and I find your sister to act rather prudish. I've only worn shorts or stockings with skirts when my thighs chafed.
766,I've never worn shorts under my skirts.
767,Do what makes you feel more comfortable. Neither one is bad/good. It's all about personal preference.
768,"Do you live in conservative family/community? How often girls your age do that? I saw maybe twice in my life girls wearing shorts underneath skirts. And that was long ago. In middle school maybe. 

You do you. I trust you're old enough to decide yourself. If you're comfortable than it can't be bad."
769,"No, it’s not. I wear semi short skirts and don’t wear anything other than underwear underneath. I’ve gotten flack from it before from my conservative sister, but if my skirt flies up or whatever I’m not super concerned. Shit happens."
770,"Depends how short the skirt is and if it tends to ride up if you stretch or bend over, but for the most part I’d say it’s completely fine not to wear shorts and a little weird of your sister to complain about it"
771,"I think some girls are being taught that this is the “right” thing to do by ridiculous, sexist dress code policies at public schools.  My daughter’s high school had a rule that you needed to wear bike shorts not only under skirts but also under other shorts.  Like, how many layers do you need to wear to insulate the world from your snatch?  It’s not going to leap out at people. 

The normal thing to do is to just wear underwear under skirts.  Maybe a slip of the skirt material gets staticky and clings to you.  Anything else is optional."
772,I once witnessed a girl get her skirt caught in a locking door and ever since I’ve worn shorts under skirts and short dresses
773,"I wear spandex shorts under skirts when the skirts are particularly short or on a windy day, but I do it for my own comfort level, not for anyone else. Do whatever you feel most comfortable doing -- if that's no shorts, then rock it. It's a freeing feeling sometimes to feel the breeze, so to speak.

Edit: but sometimes I just wear underwear even if it's short or windy, because I feel confident enough not to care those days -- if someone sees my underwear, it's not the end of the world"
774,"I’ve never worn shorts under a skirt, like ever. 

I do them bend over in front of a mirror truck to decide if a skirt is too short. If I can see my underwear in the mirror it’s too short for me."
775,"It’s not bad not to wear shorts, it’s a personal preference based on YOUR comfort level. 

For me, if it’s above knee length I wear shorts, otherwise I’ll flash someone because I sit like a dude or wind will make me pull a Marilyn. 

If it’s below the knee I generally don’t unless it’s summer and I’m worried about chafing."
776,I literally never wear shorts under dresses.
777,I have never ever worn shorts under a skirt? Who is gonna be stood directly underneath you to look?
778,"I’m confused, how did she know if you were or weren’t wearing shorts?"
779,"As someone who loves skirts of all lengths, I have never once worn shorts or pants under a skirt. Girls did that with jeans in second grade and it looked ridiculous. I have seen people wear leggings under skirts, but I never have. I sometimes will wear tights, however. Pants or shorts? Absolutely never. I would feel like a young child."
780,God no its not bad. There's nothing wrong with wearing skirts with or without shorts. Your clothing should be a *personal* comfort or aesthetic thing.
781,"Am I the only one shocked the whole short thing sparked such heated debate?? 

For the OP wear whatever the heck you want. You wanna wear shorts? Do it. Dont want to: dont do it. Its your business and your business ONLY. 

I have a particularly short summer flowy dress and I do wear shorts under it because the lightest breeze lifts it up. For any other dress I dont."
782,"Wearing skirts my whole life bc of school uniform. Everyone wore shorts underneath bc we didn’t want to flash each other going up stairs. Post uniform, it depends on the skirt. Maxi or midi skirt , no. Shorter than that - yes."
783,"I have never heard of wearing shorts under skirts, with the exception of chafing-prevention. Even in short miniskirts, I usually wear a thong. People shouldn't be looking up your skirt!"
784,"what kind of shorts do you wear under skirts? I've never done it but I've never found shorts that hide well under skirts to not ruin the whole ""skirt effect"""
785,Never worn shorts under. As long as it covers your birds and pieces it's fine.
786,"Wait, how short is your skirt that she called you out on this? How would anyone even know?"
787,That’s not a thing..
788,Both of my teenage daughters always wear biker type shorts under skirts. I have no idea why.
789,I've never worn shorts under a skirt. And it's really weird and rude of your sister to make such a rude comment about it. Wtf? Wear what you're comfortable with!
790,"I don't wear shorts under skirts, but also I make sure my skirt is long enough that a person walking behind me on a staircase can't see my underwear."
791,"I usually wear booty shorts under my skirts, just so I can be more free minded when walking around even at home."
792,"I have never worn shorts under a skirt, I didn't realise that was even a thing."
793,"Well, this is a few questions really. 

First of all, you're in your own house around your family.  I barely wear clothes when I'm just lounging around the house.  You should be able to just wear what feels comfortable there, whatever level of dressed that may be.  

Second, when out and about whether or not you wear shorts under a skirt is up to you.  I personally only wear them under my skirts when the skirt is a little shorter than I'm comfortable with or when I might sweat a bit because it keeps my thighs from rubbing.  I would not consider it weird either way. 

The third, kind of unspoken question is if not wearing shorts under skirts would be perceived as weird or immodest. In my part of the world (Texas), no not really unless your skirt is so short that your normal movements risk showing your underwear.  Even then the focus wouldn't be, ""Eww she's not wearing shorts"" and more ""she's about to flash somebody!""

Ultimately I'd say wear what feels more comfortable for you and let your sister get over her own hang-ups without involving you."
794,I don’t even wear panties under skirts
795,"Lol your sister sucks. I’ve always been a shorts under skirts person cause I was raised in an overly prudish environment but I have slowly gotten over that. As long as I’m not lumpy in the wrong places or showing the goods off to everyone I’m content. I’ll wear a slip if it looks unappealing. Your sister was conditioned into her thought process, pay her no mind."
796,"I have never worn shorts under skirts. I have recently bought some to wear under because my plan for this spring summer was to be outside walking a lot more and I was going to be in dresses because of comfort (and now I’m in pajamas because even the best made plans fall apart sometimes). 

So no it’s not bad at all. You do you. I think if you’re outside and it’s windy you might want to but it’s not at all bad."
797,"Girl absolutely not. I wear them under skirts when I'm teaching, because I teach music to small children and we move a lot. Every other time? Nope. 

Ok, when I'm swing dancing I do, but that's because I expect my skirt to fly up and show my butt. That's part of swing. But I never even wore them before I started teaching. And if you're in your own home, you can do what you want!"
798,It's up to you and what you feel comfortable with. That is the only thing that matters.
799,"My response is ""u wear shorts under ur skirts!?"" Do ur thing girl. If ur comfortable with it. Go for it!"
800,I have always been told to wear them. On top of being anxious about my butt showing I guess my mom was worried someone would peek or something
801,"Personally, I used to not wear shorts under my skirts and dresses but that changed when I was upskirted - taken pics/videos under my dress - by a man at the mall. If you don’t wear shorts under your skirts please be careful!"
802,"I tend to wear something but that's more so because I'm clumsy and don't want to worry about it, but in my own house? Hell no.  Your sister is being pretty ridiculous."
803,I think it's ironic that people draw attention to visible panties or bras when a bikini is no big deal.
804,We used to wear boxer shorts under our school dresses but that's it. I would never bother wearing shorts under a skirt.
805,Lol I actually thought it went the opposite; I thought I was the weird one because I always wear bike shorts under skirts and dresses
806,"Only if I’m biking or it’s hot out and I need to prevent chaffing. 

But, I did come from a very conservative family who had a habit of shaming if the outline of your body was ever very distinct (didn’t have to be revealing in any way). And your sister’s comment reminds me a lot of them. 

It’s reinforcing the status quo - which in many cases is misogyny."
807,"I don't think I've ever worn shorts under my skirts, although I do know some people wear them when they do active things just for comfort or to make sure nothing is seen especially when it's super windy. But no, it's definitely not bad not to!"
808,Why is this a 175-comment debate?
809,"There's nothing wrong with wearing a skirt without shorts, it's totally personal prefrence. I know plently of girls who do and plently who don't. I really don't see how it's anyone elses business. You should wear what makes you comfortable, especially while you're at home."
810,"I insist my 7 year old wear shorts under skirts at school/in public.

It’s not a “decency” thing... it’s because She LOVES skirts and dresses, and I don’t want her movement/play to be restricted by what she’s wearing, or by embarrassment at someone seeing her undies.

At your age? I’d assume people aren’t wearing shorts under skirts unless they’re playing sports in them. Certainly not in their own homes!"
811,"I used to wear spandex under all my skirts in middle school and maybe freshman year. I guess it didn’t feel as sexy after that so I switched to boy short underwear or a full coverage bikini under panty under skirts. Now that I’m in college, I wear thongs under my skirts. Do what makes you feel good, but after high school I’d say you gotta ditch the shorts under."
812,Most of my skirts are long enough that I don’t worry about it but I have a couple here and there that I do put on “safety shorts” for. I dress in jfashion (weeb alert) and some still have shorts built in (sukapan) but otherwise I have cute frilly shorts (bloomers? But they’re quite short too) that just add to the aesthetic if the skirt happens to ride up enough for them to fulfill their purpose.
813,"If I’m going out I usually do but just hanging out at home then I don’t bother. To me it’s like wearing leggings that are kind of see through. If I’m going out wear a long shirt over it but if I’m at home, who cares? 😂"
814,I never do unless I'm REALLY worried the skirt will fly up (if it's windy outside or something).
815,"I thinks it's really just your comfort level. I used to wear them all the time, but now I only do if it's a windy day, or of the skirt is just really short."
816,"The only time I wear shorts underneath is if its windy af outside and I cant be bothered to hold my skirt down. I'm gonna let that thing fly and it's your fault if you freak out! Bonus points for wearing skin coloured shorts. People lose their minds.

Also I use them to hold tights up. That's it.

Or spanx"
817,"Nope. I only wear then because I have fat thighs and they'd rub, otherwise."
818,It’s totally fine. On the special occasion I wear a skirt I ALWAYS have shorts on under regardless of the length.
819,"i mean, if you're home who cares what you wear. i never got the opportunity to wear flowy mini-skirts because my butt shows so thanks for the tip. :p"
820,No I never do
821,"So I will wear tights or bike shorts under my skirts but it's for *MY* comfort, not the comfort of others. (I'm a preschool teacher and I move a lot) How you wear your skirts is up to you, and there is nothing wrong with wearing them without shorts.

&#x200B;

Edit: Formatting"
822,"Never done this. I wear slips sometimes with sheer fabric, but never shorts and defo never at HOME."
823,My sister and I never bothered to wear pants at all if we were just chilling in the house. Forever just lounging in our underwear. 🤷
824,I wouldn’t say it’s bad especially if you are comfortable with everyone in your home.  Your sis might have seen you at an awkward angle making your nether bits more exposed lol.  I personally wear little booty shorts under my skirts because I am on the short side so I tend to wear shorter skirts.  I think whatever makes you comfortable!
825,"I’m 21 and have NEVER worn anything under my dresses or skirts unless it was a nice event, I’d wear thin tights."
826,"The only time I wore spandex shorts underneath my skirt was when I was out playing and the stupid boys would lift my skirt up. Otherwise, no."
827,"Just wear full coverage undies if you want to feel modest under the skirt.


Shorts are not required but are beneficial if you don't pay attention to posture or are clumsy like me... So I actually like wearing them. I wouldn't shame someone for not wearing them."
828,I've never worn shorts under my skirts. I don't even wear panties under them but they're long enough that my ass doesn't touch the seat.
829,I sometimes wear thong under a short skirt
830,"I wear shorts under skirts if I’m playing tennis or some other sport, which makes me very active and thus there a huge chance the skirt will flip over. 

Slips, girdles, long socks are for work skirts, because they keep them comfortable and you don’t have to fix them all the time (they have a reputation as being only sexy, but they are actually for those kind of clothes:make it easier to go to the bathroom.)  

Everything else is fair game. I wear summer dresses, free flowing skirts etc. with only my underwear on and I have never had any problems."
831,I typically don’t but I want to more often. I have a friend that always does. Idk which is more common but both are normal.
832,"Some people wear shorts under skirts, but it's definitely not expected.  For me, the point of a skirt is to avoid wearing shorts.  But the real answer here is that it's truly no one's business what's under your skirt."
833,"Of course it is not BAD to not wear shorts underneath. But it definitely can help out in some instances. Your sister is most likely looking out for you. Maybe she’s trying to make sure you have a habit of it when out in public? Maybe she knows that some families have gross fathers/uncles/grandfathers that sexually abuse their own family members and that’s why she said that remark even though you were at home. In the end though, it is your choice. I am 26 years old and always wear spandex or “boyshort underwear” underneath my skirts and dresses. I will mention that i grew up on Long Island, NY since some of you are saying it’s a location thing. I don’t remember if my friends did it too or if my parents made me. I just know that I feel more comfortable knowing there’s no possibility of a mishap. Sometimes I like to sit weird, sometimes going up the stairs can be dangerous with people walking underneath you...all it takes is a quick glance, sometimes the wind blows, sometimes people will be jerks and do what they can to get a peek. But again, in the end, it is whatever makes you feel comfortable."
834,"It’s not bad to not wear shorts under skirts, and it’s not bad to wear shorts under skirts either. I’ve always worn Nike Pros underneath skirts because that’s what I’m comfortable with. Most of my friends where I live wear Pros underneath skirts and dresses too. I’m a former dancer so it’s just what came naturally to me. Most of my cheer friends do too. Maybe it’s a habit/mobility thing? After going to college in the South, i’ve seen SO many asses because girls dont wear shorts under skirts. So maybe it’s also a regional thing? No idea if it has to do with anything other than personal preference.  

Doesn’t matter what it is, just do what makes you feel comfortable."
835,I refuse to wear any dress or skirt unless I have a pair of bike shorts under them. It's just the most comfortable for me and I feel safer in a way. But there's also NOTHING wrong with not wearing shorts under them too. You did nothing wrong. You do you boo.
836,"I used to do this! BUt I graduated away from it when I grew older and didn't want to ruin the line of my skirt.

If you want to do this for modesty's sake (or if you move a lot, like in dancing), bike shorts or dancing unitards are great. They don't spoil the look and still cover things up."
837,How did she know what you had on under your skirt?? only time I did this was when I was forced to wear a dress in catholic school and the boys lifted out skirts so we had to wear shorts underneath. If a skirt is see through then I wear a slip underneath.
838,"I only wear shorts underneath if it’s super short, and usually flesh-colored jockey microfiber slip-shorts, and ONLY for the purpose of ensuring against a peep show when the wind blows. Otherwise, no."
839,Unless I know I'm going to be in weird positions (climbing or stuff) I don't.
840,"I've never done that in my life. I guess it's rarer that people do, but just know you're not weird for skipping the shorts!"
841,It doesn't really matter at all. I've gone out plenty of times without even wearing panties underneath my skirts or dresses. It all depends on how confident and comfortable you feel doing it.
842,"If it's a midi skirt or longer, then no. Anything shorter, yes. There are a lot of perverts on the crowded trains where I live. I can just wear bike shorts or something similar."
843,"I don’t usually wear shorts under skirts and dresses.  I usually wear some boy short underwear because they cover more, but that’s it. I have worn shorts when it was summer to prevent chaffing, but even then it’s rarely and depends on what I am doing and how hot it is. 

If you are fine not wearing shorts under your skirt that is fine. It is not bad."
844,"No it’s not bad - most people do that. I only wear shorts under a skirt if it’s a very short skirt, it’s very windy, or I’m on my period"
845,"My older sister says the same thing to me, weather I’m wearing skirts or a dress. Personally, I think it’s just fine unless I’m wearing a shortish skirt and it’s extra windy out. Be confident in your body, but also know that you are the one who makes choices regarding it."
846,"I used to be really christian/homeschooled and I feel like wearing shorts under skirts is something girls who are serious about modesty do. The only time I would wear shorts under a skirt is if it was see-through (and if it wasnt a super casual skirt I'd probably wear a slip). However, I almost exclusively wear dresses and skirts to my office and none of them are see-through. Most skirts aren't. There's a few that might be but it's not noticeable unless there's light shining through them."
847,I rarely wear skirts/dresses but I've never worn one with shorts underneath. I've got a friend who likes going commando in dresses even though I personally wouldn't ever do that.
848,Wear whatever you are comfortable in girlfriend!
849,"You only need shorts underneath if it makes you more comfortable! I like short bike shorts sometimes if I know it’s going to super windy, but honestly they’re not needed at all."
850,"Nahh. Even when I'm wearing shorter skirts that can easily catch the wind, I don't often wear anything underneath unless it's cold and usually it's gonna be leggings. I do have a pair of lacy bike shorts for fashion sometimes for short skirts just to be cute."
851,"I believe this is more of a personal choice. I have never felt comfortable not wearing shorts under my skirts, but that's a me thing. I wear short biker shorts or lycra shorts, kind of similar to the ones cheerleaders wear & they are extremely comfortable & don't worry about them even if I'm wearing short skirts."
852,"Do your schools have strict dress codes about shorts under skirts? I live in Texas and both my daughters go to schools with that rule. I think it's absolutely ridiculous, tbh. But I'm wondering if that's why your sister made such a big deal about it? Maybe she's used to that dress code and never thought to question it."
853,"I have never worn shorts under a skirt in my life. I never gave it much thought 

If I'm concerned my panties would show like on a windy day or something I'd wear opaque tights too

But I have to say I never worn shorts under a skirt tho"
854,"No, it's not bad to not wear shorts under a skirt. I do sometimes when I'm going out, but that is only because my thighs are ... well-built, yes, and I need some fabric separating them so that there's no chafing, and being high I sometimes have a hard time finding tights that stay up so with some dresses and skirts it's just easier to wear shorts and be done with it. If this is your reason, or if you yourself decide that you want to wear them to stop your underwear from being visible, then that is alright, and I can see someone having good intentions when they ask you to put shorts on when you go out (because, you know, there's some dumb people who think that if you show underwear by accident then you want a sexual encounter, morons ...), but telling you to wear them at home too is going too far because it's very close to claiming that any unwanted attention from men is something you deserve.

So yeah, I think your family is going a bit too far."
855,I never wear shirts under skirts. Don’t let ANYONE body shame you . Ever.
856,"I would recommend shorts under a skirt in public. I'm talking about small, thin, spandex type of shorts. I say this for your own sake because I've had wind blow my skirt up and was super happy I was wearing shorts underneath! You never know what could happen in public. 

I'm always happy that I choose to wear shorts because I don't have to be careful with my movement.

Also, sometimes you may bend over a little too far and will show off what's under your skirt."
857,"Yeah I have the same problem, find it weird that they're sexulising me when non of my actions implied that except lack of bra"
858,"I find that too with my highly conservative family... anything sexual at all (even if it's just no bra, slightly tight clothes, really anything that shows your body) makes them extremely uncomfortable."
859,"Same. I basically wear only skirts and dresses and I never wear shorts with them. My skirts are about fingertip length and sometimes shorter. 

I am kinda used to walking around with them. Maybe you ran up the stair and were bouncing? Probably saw more than she wanted to see. But either way it just the house so who really cares?"
860,Bike/running shorts. I’m tall and I’m like sitting in weird ways and climbing trees and shit so I’m almost guaranteed to flash my panties if I don’t wear them. I feel like it’s a trend that kinda started around 2015 ish
861,"If i don't wear skimmies under my dresses, I shall become the queen of Chub Rub. Even at my lightest weight, I had no thigh gap. 

Once, a few years ago, I went without a pair due to forgetting to do laundry. Went to work, which involved  20 minute walk each way. It was the middle of summer. The thigh burn lasted for days!"
862,We're not talking never-nude jean shorts or basketball shorts lol. Just spandex shorts like for biking or yoga.
863,Chub rub is real :(
864,They make lots of nice silky compression shorts to wear under skirts. They help the skirt lay flat (if it's a clingy fabric) and don't show! I find my legs and butt get sweaty if I don't wear shorts under a skirt/dress so they're awesome to have.
865,I usually wear volleyball shorts underneath so the line aren’t really apparent and the shorts aren’t that bulky.
866,I wear boxer briefs under my dresses and skirts because my thighs rub together if I don’t.
867,When I was younger I wore volleyball shorts under my skirts to try and negate chub rub. Didn’t always work. Now I just...don’t walk as much I guess.
868,Some prefer wearing leggings underneath I imagine for the bulkiness reason.
869,"Actually, it's really nice! My thighs don't run together and cause chafing."
870,To stop chafing in the summer and stopping your thighs sticking together while sitting down in hot weather. It's so uncomfortable. Shorts stop this. I don't have a thigh gap even at my thinnest my body just isn't made like that.
871,"Yeah this is the reason I used to do it when I was fatter and my thighs always rubbed. Then I lost weight and it was much less of an issue.

I sometimes make my 4 year old wear shorts under her skirts but that's because she likes to climb and skirts get tucked into her shorts so they don't get in the way, if she's not wearing shorts she gets upset when she realisesshe has no wear to tuck her skirt (she's tucked it onto her underpants a few times because climbing is important). The other reason is without shorts your butt sticks to the slide at the playground unless you smooth your skirt under your butt carefully or sit on your hat to slide. It would be easier to just wear shorts without a skirt but 4 year old logic."
872,I wear them if a skirt is prone to flying up and it’s windy.
873,"I do think she was just looking out for me, but I think that’s it’s not a big deal if your at home, plus I rarely wear skirts or dresses."
874,This is probably the best comment
875,"I tend to pair super short skirts with one of my leather jackets, and then I sit on the jacket when I get on the bus. It works to keep the skirt comfy while not rubbing my bare leg on the most horrifyingly dirty plastic."
876,"Yep, same. Only reason is to prevent my thighs from chafing."
877,"Yeah, I always wear shorts on the rare occasion I go out in skirts or dresses."
878,"I thought it was pretty common thing, most people I know who wear skirts usually wear shorts underneath, there would be the off time wear some people wouldn’t."
879,"If you’re walking up stairs, people below you can easily look up and see underneath your skirt."
880,"I fear you might be too innocent lol, nobody is gonna be stood underneath you, but a small camera might probably will.   


Some people are shitty."
881,"I’m sorry to hear that happened too you, I’m always nervous that this could happen to me."
882,"In my house we have a spiral staircase that goes straight up, so I guess she just looked up."
883,"Guess personally I wouldn't really find it the end of the world if someone saw my undies, though it's only happened to me once or twice in my life so it's apparently not a major issue for me either haha"
884,"Earlier because I've definitely been doing it most of my life. Idk if it was widespread, I grew up Mormon so it might have been localized to the overly modesty obsessed.

(note, I'm not particularly tall or anything, but if you tell me to sit a certain way you've just guaranteed I won't.)"
885,"I wore shorts with skirts when I was younger, I figured it was just customary for children to do this."
886,We used to wear soffee shorts under like VERY short skater skirts in 2003. It’s just a modesty thing.
887,"Hmmm, if I’m going to be climbing trees and whatnot I just wear shorts instead, why bother with the skirt? But to each their own"
888,It's not. I grew up with it as a requirement. Where I'm from perverts are everywhere and take advantage of every opportunity.
889,"People have always done this, I started wearing shorts under skirts when I went to a Catholic school in 5th grade in roughly 1997. (I am now a 31 year old lady and don't wear shorts with skirts anymore.)

I think it just depends on personal preference and comfort/modesty."
890,It was a thing in the early '90s too when we wore babydoll dresses
891,My school uniform skirts were absurdly short so I wore bike shorts under them so I felt more comfortable.
892,Oh god yes. And it doesn’t help either that my inner thigh hair grows in every damn direction so I can NEVER shave them totally smooth. So add stubble in there. Ouch ouch ouch
893,"Still seems like they'd give weird lines if the dress is tight at all. I could see spanx or something like that though.

I do find it funny I've now learned there's such a thing as never-nude jeans shorts, volleyball shorts and basketball shorts from these comments haha. Will have to Google all these things to see what the differences are."
894,Had to Google volleyball shorts and it looks to me like they're basically gonna show as much as underwear? Why not just skip the extra layer?
895,"Aside from your sister protecting you from being sexually harassed on the street, I'm also guessing that she was also doing that to protect your decency or something similar to that."
896,Agreed!
897,"Maybe it's common for your generation but I'm 40 and have almost exclusively worn dresses and skirts my whole life and I've never heard of anyone wearing shorts under a skirt. I just asked my sister if she's every done that and she looked at me like I was crazy. I'm saying this because this must be a new fashion, which means all of us have managed to survive without shorts under our skirts, regardless of what your sister thinks is okay. She can wear skirts however she wants and you can too. There are many, many generations of women that have never worn shorts under a skirt, you'll be fine. I do have a question, though: if you wear pantyhose or tights, do you wear the shorts under or over? Like, do you put on the shorts and then pantyhose, or put on the pantyhose and then the shorts?"
898,You did ask the question so you do have some concerns about showing off.  I just want to add something. Any fashion choice is acceptable if you feel good in it! Don't let anyone decide for you. Wearing shorts is ok. Not wearing shorts is also ok.
899,"It’s a hipster fashion choice, or one that comes from not wanting to be assaulted.

You aren’t supposed to wear shorts under, they’re not designed that way and also defeats the purpose of wearing a skirt.

99% of people do not wear shorts under skirts or dresses. Leggings and panty hose yes, not shorts.

It’s fine if you do, and I can understand if it’s a new fashion choice or to protect yourself from predators, but it’s completely fine to not wear shorts underneath"
900,"I guess, the skirts I wear probably aren’t short enough for that 🤷‍♀️"
901,If someone wants to see my underwear that bad then good luck to them. To be fair the skirts I wear aren’t super short.
902,tell her to stop looking up your dress
903,Well basically every regular length (like the lower thigh length) skirt becomes a mini skirt on me due to my height
904,It was the opposite for me and my friends. Once we became teenagers we started being more aware of stuff and started wearing them.
905,I don’t always plan for it. Sometimes I will just be out and about and I’ll suddenly see a really good climbing tree and then I wanna climb.
906,"Not who you were asking, but in my case it's cause I like sundresses and the goal was feeling pretty while I went about my day. I just also knew I might be tree climbing because of who I planned to be with and where we'd be going, so like, why would I ruin my chance to be pretty just in case of tree climbing when I can do both? 

Also the whole reason I like skirts so much is because they add drama to my movement (especially spins, kicks, ect) so shorts under my dress is optimal any time I want to be dramatic, like when I go dancing or something."
907,That’s just when I remember everyone I knew starting to wear it. But that’s also around when we became teenagers sooo that might be why
908,"I don't wear them w tight skirts, because they don't kick up in the wind and turn you into a flasher. With twirly skirts, there's always the risk it'll lift up even just from the movement of walking. 

Never nude is from Arrested Development. There's a running gag that one guy can't be naked and wears jean shorts under everything."
909,They hide the underwear and having the extra layer just feels nice too have for extra protection.
910,“Protect your decency”? Gross way to put it
911,"I'm almost 40, and I wore shorts under skirts when I was a *kid*\--up until I was about 17 or 18--because I couldn't trust myself to sit 'like a lady' or not to flash people by accident. It had more to do with immaturity than anything else.

As far as your pantyhose question: many women in the US under 40 don't wear them anymore, but if they do *and* they wear shorts with them, the shorts go on after the pantyhose."
912,The shorts would be like a slip. So over.
913,"I'm 30 and the opposite of a hipster and wear shorts under my dresses every single time because I like not having my thighs chafed to shreds. 

  I have a toddler and frequently have to squat or crawl after her and I'd just as well not flash anyone either. 

Just because you don't *see* them wearing shorts doesn't mean they're not, because you actually checking would be considered deeply inappropriate at best and criminal at worst.    Judging by the rising popularity of undersummers, I'm pretty sure you're pulling numbers out of thin air.   Being raised in NYC does not make you an expert in What People Wear."
914,"how do they defeat the purpose of a skirt? I wear shorts under my skirts and they’ve never made me feel like i’m not wearing a skirt, my legs are still not in full length pants. Also, i wouldn’t say it’s a new/hipster fashion choice, im 20 and i’d say since middle school any girl i’ve been friends with at school or my sisters have worn them under dresses/skirts, so it’s really not as uncommon as you think. maybe it’s an age/location thing?"
915,"Whether it’s a long dress or a long skirt, if it’s loose and flowing, there’s still a possibility for a full view from someone down below."
916,Same but adding a badonk makes it worse in the back. I've always work bike sorta because of it
917,Have you considered you may be a squirrel?
918,"Zach Braff gets in on the never-nude action, too.  ""There are dozens of us!  Dozens!"""
919,Totally get that! I have some leggings I cut up that I wear under skirts.
920,protection from what?
921,"Speaking of a traditional sense, that is. Just a wild guess, anyway."
922,"Just looked it up, cause i never heard of undersummers, they sound super useful and something i’d definitely buy for my skirts! 

But ehhem, those are considered *underwear*... 

Maybe we are both wrong in what we perceive as shorts. For me, i base it off what i find in the stores i go to. They all have denim shorts that are around booty short or cover half the thigh. For me, i have NEVER heard of someone wearing those under a skirt.

Hiking shorts? Nope. Workout shorts? Nope. Leggings which are not classified as shorts? Yes. Panty hose? Yes. Spandex/undersummers/etc, yes. 

When i saw this question, i was thinking of normal shorts, as people have been known to wear straight up long jeans under dresses. I have never seen someone wear what first comes to my mind for shorts, with a skirt.

And really, what in the world are you bringing this into criminal behavior territory. That is utterly disgusting of you.

Do you need to look up someones skirt to know they are wearing denim shorts under? No. Because it would be hella obvious from the lines.

And really, that’s not even the point. Ive never heard anyone talk about it, a poster or display mention it, or a tv ad about it. 

If the shorts you describe are not noticeable as they are underwear, then what does the op even have to ask???

Does she have to wear something that no one will even notice her (not) wearing???

I could be very wrong in my understanding of OP and what is defined as shorts, but really, your mind wants to accuse first and ask questions never. Good day."
923,"Im 24. Could be a generational thing is what i mean. Im a millennial, you’re a zoomer. 

Im saying maybe gen z has a different fashion, but for my generation it’s a hipster thing.

They defeat the purpose because it’s supposed to be loose, and you’re covering your thighs twice. Even just functionally, besides undergarments, you really only need to cover any part of your body once unless it’s winter and you need a sweater.

Functionally there’s no point in wearing two things over your thighs. Leggings are decorative, but they’re usually cause legs get cold.

You can always buy a skort. Ive never seen a fashion in my generation or earlier of people wearing shorts underneath skirts. Ive seen people wear pants under dresses which is just as weird imo, and that is a hipster thing in my generation. 

I grew up in NYC where I had 1000 kids in my school. Went to summer programs, etc. Ive never heard anything about skirts under shorts, and if you look at past generations, they didnt do it either.

Hell, girls weren’t even allowed to wear shorts/pants until the past 100 years or so.

Edit:

https://luckyandme.com/growing-fashion-trend-wearing-shorts-under-skirts/

It’s a generational thing, confirmed. Trend started in 2015 (5 years ago) where girls aged 3-10 started wearing them in mass.

This was not a thing before. While there are people like you who were 15 at the time who wore shorts under, it was not a trend for my generation."
924,Happy cake day
925,I just like sitting weird ways so I just started wearing them
926,Funnily enough i did use to collect acorns and nuts... oh god
927,The bus seat? The wind kicking your skirt up? Not everyone wants to walk around with their underwear out.
928,"Also 24 and I've always worn shorts under skirts, as have most people I know. Maybe it also has to do with area? I'm from southern US"
929,"I'm 28 and I don't consider it a hipster thing don't throw all us millennials into your ""clothes are only for designated purposes"" thing. I personally prefer shorts under skirts because it makes *me* more comfortable knowing there's no risk of panty shots or my thighs chafing from rubbing together. But I wear skirts still because they're cute, not because of their functionality. 

I've never heard anyone refer to someone just being comfortable as hipster clothing but go off I guess."
930,"i really don’t think 20 and 24 are that big of a difference, one of my sisters is 23 and does it. Maybe like someone else said, it’s a southern thing? i own two pairs of black spandex shorts i’ll wear under skirts and they’re both short, no one i know has any that would cover their thighs they’re more life soffe shorts-length at the longest 

skorts are much harder to come by and they’re never the same styles as regular skirts so i really don’t think those would be a viable option simple because of the lack of choice available.

I dont see how you having 1000 people in your school changes anything? congrats i guess, my graduating class was over 1400 if we’re bringing that up lol (also Ashley Tisdale wore pants under skirts all the time in the early 2000s, i wouldn’t really say it was a hipster thing even if you’re older, i remember being 8 and wearing jeans under a dress to school it was pretty popular)"
931,"I’m 26 and at the very edge of the generational gap, I hate to tell you this but you’re on the older side of gen z. Also, I’ve always worn shorts under short flippy skirts, living in a windy area makes cute tennis skirts, skater skirts and circle skirts impossible to wear without a pair of bike shorts underneath. When I was a little kid all my skirts came with shorts underneath that matched the skirts, Gap, Limited Too etc all sold kids skirts with either built in shorts or matching ones. This is not generational."
932,"Don't forget that our generation is the one that made jeans under dresses a trend in the 2000s. We didn't have hipsters back then, but that trend was not part of any subculture - it went fully mainstream.

Why buy a skort (where most of them seem to be either athletic wear, like tennis skirts) when you can just choose from a larger selection and variety of regular skirts?

I personally wear shorts under a skirt or dress because I am often riding my bike, and because I choose shorts with pockets to pair with my dresses that don't have pockets (which is most of them unfortunately). There is additional functionality there besides warmth.

I think the trend/fad you're describing is to have shorts visible under skirts, but people wearing them for modesty aren't intending to have them seen. You wouldn't know I was wearing shorts under my dress unless you saw me mount/dismount my bike or put something in my shorts pocket. It's not intended to be a fashion statement, or really to be seen regularly at all."
933,"That's not what anyone is talking about at all. Stop speaking like you're the ultimate millennial guru.... exercise shorts (you know, the tiny bike shorts that aren't like leggings?) Were worn under shorts constantly back then. Around about the same time that wearing the same tiny bike shorts over tights was a legitimate trend. Women have worn shorts or the like under skirts since they were invented? (You used to have to wear bloomers once upon an era). Tossing out the shorts and not giving a damn about being ""ladylike"" is much newer."
934,I didn’t say I wanted to I was genuinely curious.   My chicken legs and skirts don’t mix well so I thought I’d ask.
935,I just turned 25 and remember doing this in like 8/9th grade going through the whole scene kid phase.
936,"Jeans under a dress was pretty popular. But my point is that ive never seen someone wear a combo of shorts and skirt together. Ever. And i meant more so that I wasn’t a hermit living under a rock, it just wasnt a thing growing up.

Do you have a link to the ashley tisdale thing, cause i could just be being moronic. I recall her wearing leggings under a skirt, and i think selena gomez or demi lovoato wore jeans with their dress. But i never said i never saw that happening, 

I said shorts under skirt wasnt a thing i even heard of. Imagine short denim shorts under a skirt, it’s just not a thing.

Also, isnt the spandex thing you mention underwear? When i think shorts i think of hiking shorts, denim shorts that barely cover the ass, shorts that cut off a little above the knees, and then shorts that actually cover the knees (which i cant seem to ever find). Every mall i go to, shorts are typically the denim barely ass covering ones. Or denim barely on the thighs.

I just dont even know what shorts under a skirt would look like, it would chaffe, it would show— if you’re talking about spandex, that just sounds like undies, which id totally get"
937,"No, the official benchmark is 1996 being the cutoff, where if you are born in 96 you are a millennial. All official sources agree on this.

But to the other point, maybe it’s a southern thing. Im from the northern east coast. 🤷‍♀️

All I know is that ive NEVER heard of this. 

And really none of these points address the main question of whether it’s okay to not wear shorts. It’s fine to not wear shorts, and it clearly is a... location thing as to whether it’s even normalized."
938,"You’ve probably never seen it because the shorts are not supposed to be visible. I am 29 and I’ve always worn small black or tan spandex shorts under my skirts. The only underwear I wear are thongs, so I definitely don’t want my whole ass showing if a gust of wind happens."
939,"I grew up in a river valley in the northern us where it gets super windy. My university campus had wind so bad sometimes it would make you stumble and when it was icy out it would push you around so most of the girls I know also would wear something under their skirts.
Also I think that when people say shorts they mean small soffe shorts or bike shorts that are shorter than the length of the skirt, not denim shorts or cargo shorts."
940,"It's hard to concentrate and I'm pretty terrified of being laid off, even though I have no real reason to and haven't been given any indication that it'll happen by my company. My bosses are actually being pretty cool about working from home and I'm trying to be as productive as possible but end each day feeling weirdly guilty that I should have been more productive. I didn't expect to miss my regular life and even my commute so much and I've only been socially isolating for two weeks now!! But if being bored at home and dealing with my first world problems is my part to play in all of this, I suppose I have a lot to be grateful for :)"
941,"I've brought a coloring book to work, there is nothing to do. I'm glad I'm still getting paid, but we just slip by being essential because we make medical devices, but our scope is not anything that is truly essential. We're not making much product because nobody's buying because our clients are all at home. So I'll just be over here coloring and wishing I could bring my Switch to work lol."
942,"Oh man, I gotta say that I'm enjoying working from home. 

I can listen to my music on my speakers, wear pajamas, get up and stretch whenever, visit with my dogs, let bread proof all day, etc. I've also been more productive on my work projects than usual. 

My husband and I have been breaking up the day by doing a lunch-time workout every day too. Nice way to release some endorphins.

Otherwise, I go for lots of dog walks, started some seeds, got lots of cleaning done, made some soap, played way too much Animal Crossing... it's been great actually."
943,I am so grateful that I know a paycheck is coming in. But! Both kids being home from school and needing private area to do video appointments with clients has been stressful. The house is falling apart about as quick as my sanity. I should throw in that my clients are mostly lower income who have struggled with addiction and it’s been hard to keep their spirits up without draining mine! I’ve also been sick which is not helping. I just keep telling myself (and everyone) it’s going to be OK. It has to be. Just do the best I can every day! I’m here if anyone needs to vent! No judgement!
944,"Employment right now is definitely something to be grateful for. I'm sorry you're dealing with anxiety about getting laid off. It sounds like you're in a pretty good spot work-wise. I would recommend giving yourself as much of your regular life as possible. Maybe take a drive (but don't get out of the car) a couple times a week if you need a change of scenery. Maybe getting up every day and keeping your beauty/coffee routine will help you stay on track. Do you do anything or listen to any books or podcasts while you work normally? I would imagine keeping some of the ambience the same might help. Maybe set up a video chat with some coworkers to catch up and feel more social. If you can try and designate a spot at home where you get all your work done, so that you keep your same mentality when you sit down to complete tasks. Make sure you're doing things that keep you sane throughout the day even if it means sacrificing some productivity. Your mental health is more important."
945,"I sort of feel the same. My work has slowed to almost a halt, sending most people home with pay except for a few core group. How I ended up in that group I don’t know, but I’m working on site as well."
946,I dye my own brows and lashes.
947,"I've definitely been doing manicures too, I've been having lots of fun with nail stamping.

I typically give my brows a good grooming once or twice a week, plucking all the dark hairs and using an eyebrow razor for all the light hairs. 

I also do a full shave once a week - legs, pits and bits."
948,On days that I'm doing a home workout or going on a run I'll put a bunch of argan oil in my hair a few hours before hand. The sweat/heat from the workout makes it like a hit oil treatment. Once I wash my hair its feels so shiny and soft
949,That's a great idea! I've never really experimented with my eyebrows because they are so light and thin. The few times I've had makeup done for events and someone fills them in they always feel too bold for my face. Maybe that's something I should start looking into.
950,How do you dye your lashes?
951,I’ve never tried nail stamping. I’m just trying to stay in the lines for now! I’ve definitely gotten better.
952,That’s such a good idea! I’ll have to try it!
953,Brilliant!
954,You can buy at home kits with the instructions.
955,Ya no problem! You can use different oils too 😊
956,"No, it's not just you. I've never been in a relationship, and all the sex  I've had has been in casual situations. 

I'm an oddball, so I don't appeal to men. 

Sadly, I still want connection. Life would have been easier if I didn't want any. 

Okay, that's not really answering you, but yeah, you're not alone."
957,"No not just you... after my last breakup I have no yearn to be with anyone and for the first time in my life even sex isn’t appealing. Sometimes I feel like I broke or something even though it wasn’t even that horrible of a breakup. I’m just going with the flow now, if it happens it happens if not, I’ll just work towards treating myself for the rest of my life to trips and nice things. Oh well."
958,"I'm 26 and my last relationship ended in 2016 and I feel the same way. All of my friends are in relationships and I've had a few flings but I never find myself interested in pursuing things. I honestly don't even like when guys stay over at my place, having to share my bed and what I consider really valuable free time. I still want sex but not random hookups......it's all very confusing. But no, you are not alone!"
959,"Yes, this is me. But also because it is much easier to find somebody to be with when you are younger, since you set the bar lower. As I get older, richer, more rooted in my ways and values, I cannot simply settle for some random sexy guy with whom the sex is amazing. This is what I used to do through my early and mid 20s. Now that I'm 30, I could never go back to that way of life."
960,"Been single since 2005 (but that was long distance, and these days I don’t even know if it counts anymore). 
He then played on my insecurities and my feelings for him to talk me into a FWB situation for the following 6 years (only seeing each other once a year or so - and only when I flew to his city to visit him). 
Then he started up with someone else and never spoke to me again. 

I have less than 0 interest in dating or sleeping around (he helpfully sent me a message listing all the things I would need to “fix” about myself if I were to ever get naked in front of someone else, to avoid any embarrassment). 

I was watching some movie not that long ago, and there was a sex scene, and for a moment I realised “oh yeah, that’s a thing.” 
Like I’d forgotten about it, because it’s been so long."
961,"> I live with my parents


Well that's probably the main reason. When I was living at home, I never once thought about dating let alone sex. Like, the thought of spending the night somewhere else and my parents knowing I'm off fucking some guy?? Or even just them listening in on a phone call. My dad especially is really, really snoopy--not in a creepy way, just in a snoopy parent way. Like, logging into my sister's bank account to see how she spends her money level of snoopy. Living at home is a mental chastity belt. 


When you move out you'll feel liberated, I guarantee it. I got back into the swings of things pretty easily when I left home. Why don't you travel alone somewhere (when covid's over), stay in a hostel, and socialize with new people? Maybe even have a little travel romance where you kiss a guy you just met on the beach overlooking a sunset lol."
962,"I have also never been in a relationship, but it’s not for lack of men wanting to date me. It’s so strange. I feel like the way I was raised contributed to this weird wall that goes up when guys get too close. I have tons of guy friends and options, but it’s overwhelming, and more importantly.... I seem to become repulsed by good guys and  attracted to guys I know will hurt me just because they are interesting/a challenge. The most messed up part is I know when I get the attention of a bad guy, I won’t want it anymore when he changes and tries to commit. I honestly don’t know how to change this. The weird part is, I’m very successful (in professional school) and very religious.... dude idek"
963,"I'm 29 and have only ever been on a handful of dates. I'm starting to lose any interest in even looking for a partner. I've noticed I'm pretty grossed out by normal relationships, too. I don't know if there's anything to even be done about it."
964,"Chiming in to say you're not alone! I'm in a similar boat as a 20-something-year-old.  My last longterm relationship ending in late 2017 and the concept of being ""in love"" feels foreign. But I have to agree with u/seelina455; the older I get, the richer I become, the more stuck in my ways I am, and settling for less, catering for worse, and changing myself for someone isn't worth the trade-off of consistent sex. Does this mean I aspire to be alone forever? Not really -- I am just comfortable knowing that it's not the goal in life -- and casual sex isn't the worse, especially if with people you trust."
965,"Same. My last relationship ended over a year ago. I've kind of tried dating maybe a few months out after the break up, but realized I just don't have the energy for it ....even now. I have a few great friends and enjoy my own company. I definitely miss the partnership, but honestly I can barely remember what it feels like sometimes."
966,"Hey hi! Been single since 2010! I’ve working on stabilizing my mental health and other things. 

As much as I want a romantic relationship, I’ve still got a lot of work to do. But I’m scared now that I’ve been so removed from that whole scene that I’d fuck it up again in worse ways.

My silly dream of being a witch, haunting a forest, are becoming more and more desirable."
967,"Yep, I think I’ve been single since like 2016? I forget, but I basically can’t conceptualize the components or what it means or feels like to be in a relationship anymore, let alone a good healthy one lol. I’m also terrified of getting involved with someone who I know isn’t “the one” so I just don’t really bother with casual dating or whatever which means I’m not really hooking up, so the concept of like good sex with someone I click with also seems super weird. It’s nice to be content but I wonder if not constantly knowing what I’m missing is gonna result in me not finding anyone. *shrug*"
968,"God, same here. My last relationship was 10 years ago. I've dated quite a bit, but I've moved so much that it's hard to fully commit to anyone. Now I feel out of the loop and getting weirder lol"
969,"Ok its honestly strange how similarly to this I feel ..like kind of exactly. I can’t figure out what the problem is ??? I just have accepted in my mind that I’m going to be alone forever. Obviously I have no way of knowing if that’s actually true or not but having a partner at the level I did before, or at levels other people do seems just ....yeah foreign"
970,"Saaame, like age and living with parents and all that."
971,I been single since 2012 and I'm 26. I've had many fails since then of almost relationships. I just am not good at it at all. I kinda wish i felt more like you with the icky feelings of holding hands or on phone or sex lol bc i want all that and it's been rough!
972,You're not alone. I go random bouts of yearning companionship to celebrating having a ton of disposable income and zero commitment. Its a weird life but one I'm slowly starting to come to terms with. Like a lot of replies here I'm lucky enough to have a solid quality of life that if I chose to share it with someone it better be worth it.
973,"My last relationship ended 3 years ago (I'm 31 now). Ever since that, I've accepted that I'll probably be alone for the rest of my life. Before that relationship I had little to no interest in dating and had been in only one other relationship so I suppose I'm back to square one. Some days I'm sad about it because I miss companionship and a deep connection. Some other days, I'm just finding myself fine living my life. I do feel a bit like an anomaly when a lot of people my age are getting married and starting families, I'll have one of my siblings and two of my cousins getting married this year and my grandparents keep pressuring me and thinking I'm not a normal human for not being married yet, but eh."
974,"Also 28! Left my fiance back in '18. I've liked a couple guys but it just wasn't feasible because they weren't good enough to take seriously or they didn't like me enough to take me seriously. It's hard to find that right fit. And it really can't just be someone who is nice to me anymore. It has to be someone good enough, respectable to me, someone independent and strong and confident but also reliable and unafraid. I want a man, not a boy. On top of all the base factors like making me laugh, good sex, and down for the same things I am. That's a tough combo man, most people don't satisfy. And that's a good thing. When I find someone who does one day I'll know it real quick."
975,Same. I do casual sex and that’s it. Actual relationship stuff does not appeal to me. I don’t even think I could do a partnership now. It would be one more thing on a list of things to do and I don’t think it should feel like that.
976,"I am SO glad you posted this because I feel the exact same way. I’ve been single for 7 years (I’m 25) and I am trying to date and all I can think these days is I don’t even know how to date or start any kind of relationship with someone. 
I would say I’m pretty comfortable with being physical with someone but figuring out if I actually like them and want to see them and be involved with them is more challenging. 

It’s a weird feeling, that’s for sure."
977,"Wow that was me a year ago. I had to go on and off dating since my last relationship was so toxic. Long story short- you don’t need anyone rn. You’re investing in yourself and going to grad school! I had no time to date last year when I was doing my program and working full time. You know you best and are going for what you want. Despite all the BS that culture throws on us- it is possible to choose your life, career & education before kids and a relationship and whatever else. My now BF and I did that and I finally feel like I met my match drive/ambition/goal wise. I get ya! I’m 27 and people already have cast off my future with a man. People need to calm down lol. Continue on your path - it’ll come when it’s right or when ya feel ready !! I wasn’t interested for a long time."
978,Yes.
979,"Single since 2013. It’s probably not good for me, but I don’t really mind it. It’s something I think about very seldom."
980,"my last relationship was in 2011.  And before that, 2003?

I spent the next few years yearning for another relationship, but I wanted to learn to love myself before getting into another relationship. Eventually I realised that all that stress I felt with sexual activity was probably because I'm just asexual.  I just thought relationship = sexy times.

Now, I'm still getting there with the loving myself part, but since learning that I'm asexual, I'm actually doing really well.  Been on a few dates, but they haven't gone anywhere.  Though thanks to my last date I did get to see Vienna (though she ghosted me the following week).

But despite all that, I been depressed in quite a while.  I'm actually doing pretty good, and dare I say, happily single?  

But seeing everyone getting married the last few years made me feel a little blah. Not depressed, but I do think a little ick.  Now I just comment ""1,5 meters apart"". Bwahaha"
981,"Nope, same as you. Almost the same timeline too, last time I had a bf was mid 2016. Been on dates, had a few potentials but nothing took. I don't forget partnership per se but I do waver between wanting it and being disgusted by it. Some days all I crave is a relationship and finally having someone again, but I'm also so used to being on my own that it would feel weird having to devote so much time and attention to a partnership. Guess I'll just keep waiting for the one who's worth that!"
982,"Very similar to your situation. Early 2016 was when I last broke up. Even in general, I've been in two very short relationships (and done women have felt it necessary to point out how that means I've never been in a real relationship). 

I get exactly how you mean, almost all my close friends are in committed relationships, and I cannot imagine any of it. Lately I've been trying to at least have sex (with someone I was pretty into or so I thought) but that encounter made me realise I just don't feel that connection with someone else anymore.

Don't know what I'm looking for, or if I'm even looking for something. Should I be looking for something? Sometimes it's disheartening I feel like something's wrong with me - even though my friends don't say it outright, I can tell they're thinking it the way they phrase things or respond to me. But at other times, I watch Magic Mike to remind myself there's so much more to life."
983,"You live with your parents, work full time AND attend grad school. Your time and mind and emotions are all busy dealing with all that. When grad school is over and you live on your own and only work I think you'll ""remember how it felt/feels again. I would say you're typical, so no worries."
984,"This is so refreshing! I really thought I was the only one feeling this way. I definitely feel like people think something is wrong with me for having these thoughts and feelings. The thought of being in a relationship is exhausting although I like intimacy. I’m not sure what’s going on. 

I thought a part of it was that I have seen such buffoonery and just straight up bad behavior in my friends relationships that It has altered my view of what relationships could be. I think seeing scandalous publicized relationships don’t help either. I have my idea of partnership and how I want to be treated. I also know what I can offer in a relationship. I’m a good catch! Solid added value! 

There is so much I enjoy in life. Spending energy trying to find someone and then go on this rollercoaster of dating makes my stomach turn. 

I also live with my parents. Two helicopter parents who are snoopy and intrusive. They have lots of love and mean well. I hope to get my own place soon. 

I’m glad to hear everyone’s thoughts. ☺️🤗"
985,"Hello! yep. I'm the same age as you and have been single for as long as you. You're not alone. I can totally relate to the hopeless feeling. Just know however you're feeling, is totally okay! You're not supposed to feel any type of way.. just feel the way you feel. It's easy to feel like something is wrong with you, especially when you compare yourself to those around you.  I constantly felt broken, but I've since learned past relationships and family often play into these feelings more than we realize... Therapy has been tremendously helpful in uncovering and understanding why I do have such aversions to sex and relationships. Also, would highly recommend the book ""Come As You Are"" by Emily Nagowski, in regards to the sexual piece. You are way more normal than you think you are. It is still hard sometimes (especially with this current isolation!), but because I finally understand how I feel and that it's okay to feel that way, it has made it easier to look forward instead of wallowing in the fear that I will die alone :) Love & light!"
986,yup!
987,Even when I was in relationships I didn't get the talking on the phone all day or even frequently. My last boyfriend liked calling me before I went to bed and I'd be like um I got nothing. I don't like talking on the phone to anyone except my mum.
988,"yooo are you me? lol 

But, for real, this is so relatable. My last proper partnership ended in 2015, there have been romantic interests since then but nothing serious and my interest in casual sex just doesn't exist anymore. It's not just you, but I'm hoping that one day we will both forget what this feels like."
989,"Same-ish. I don't mind sex but I don't care too much either so that's not the problem or something I need. I'd like to find someone who I can really connect to and share life with, which seems much harder. Just finding a guy that isn't a dick is hard lol"
990,"I was single for over 7 years, and I miss it sometimes. I miss having my own space, and having control over everything in that space. I knew when I started seeing the guy I'm with now that if it didn't work out I was done. Single for life after this. But it's been 4 years now and for some reason he's still with me. I do regret moving in together for sure. It's so much easier to be single."
991,"I'm 27 and between 16 and 26 I was never not in a relationship or seeing a guy for more than a couple weeks. I broke off my engagement over a year ago (guy decided he didn't want to get married but just wanted to date) and decided to be single for a while. I tried being casual about hooking up and eventually started dating someone again a few months ago. After 2 weeks the guy told me he was planning on moving out of the country, that he really liked me and wanted to be serious with me but not to expect anything from the relationship. After that I just have had no interest in dating. I want a family, but finding a partner isn't high on my list and neither is sex at this point. It's hard seeing almost everyone I know be in relationships, get married, start families when I've started thinking that maybe there isn't someone for me. I'm still trying to figure things out and I'm fine on my own but it still gets lonely occasionally."
992,I've just been single  ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿'̿'\\̵͇̿̿\\з= ( ▀ ͜͞ʖ▀) =ε/̵͇̿̿/’̿’̿ ̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿̿
993,"Been single for 5 years. I didn't even have the faintest interest in dating until last fall, but at this point, I kind of don't remember what it's like to have a SO and be in a relationship. I desperately miss cuddling and physical closeness and I hope I get to experience it again soon."
994,"I definitely agree. I think we all adapt after a while to our circumstances and you really just have to try to be happy no matter where you are. As someone said, the current dating landscape is t-rash so you might as well chill till it's worth it."
995,"Nope. I've been single for about 4 years, and I really don't even know what to do if I find anyone attracted to me anymore. Completely forgot most dating advice from high school and by now I've just realized that I don't really find anyone beautiful or handsome anymore. It's wierd, but at least I'm not worrying about someone else's opinions."
996,No because I’ve never been in a relationship so I don’t even know what it’s like in the first place
997,Honestly I feel the same since I broke up with my bf last year - I haven’t been touched really - and the one time I did go out to meet someone - was weird - they tried to hug me and hold my hand and even kissing just didn’t feel right - I feel like an alien -
998,What about the opposite situation?? I don't know what it's like to be single anymore and it sounds too scary
999,"Wow we’re almost identical, down to living with my parents, going to school, late 20s. Only difference for me is that it was 2014 for me. I thought I was the only one out there."
1000,"I'll probably get downvoted but while it's completely normal to be single and be happy being single, from your wording it sounds like you also have no interest in sex which isn't really normal. This could be a symptom of mild depression or if your are on the pill long term this can cause a similar feeling.

I'm not a doctor and I only say because it happened to me a while back when I was on the pill and it felt normal at the time but when I came off it and got my sex drive (and a whole load of other emotions back) and I realised I had been missing out."
1001,"Not alone. I spent 5 years being single after I broke up with my last boyfriend, which to be honest was probably pretty good for personal growth. But either way, in that entire time I didn’t find anyone remotely attractive and absolutely HATED the idea of being in a relationship with someone again until I met my current boyfriend. Even then I knew him as a friend for about 2/3 months before we finally took the plunge and started dating. You may feel weird or broke about it, as I definitely did, but really there’s nothing wrong with you and to be honest you’re likelier to end up in a better and more stable relationship than those who just date whoever (though nothing wrong with that either) because, for better or worse, you’ve probably developed higher standards for yourself. Fair warning, you may be slightly terrified when you actually meet someone you like again haha, but it will happen. But seriously, just hang in there and enjoy being able to grow independently, and the right person will come along at the right time."
1002,"Yes... dating someone for five years and have been single since. It's been three years so not that long I guess, but I've forgotten what being in a relationship is like ):"
1003,This is me...
1004,"I just want to say that our lives are literally identical. Living at home, grad school and work full time. And while the dating scene and apps haven’t worked out for me in relationships, it has allowed me to at least put myself out there and it gives me an overall higher self esteem. Not that it’s based on someone else’s opinion, but I did it as a fluke and generally didn’t want anything to do with men but knew I should be trying to date. 
Sometime in the past 3 months I’ve gone out with guys who I’ve casually slept with or texted, but knew they weren’t it for me in a relationship. So I’m still very uncertain of how to even relationship now but I eventually got out of my non interested in dating rut and know that I’m at least making connections or friends with people that may lead me to someone else down the road."
1005,"Me too. Been single since 2016 and for the most part can forget about the loneliness and lack of intimacy. It just sucks when I have dreams about being him being tender and cuddly that sucks and makes me realize what I’m missing. I don’t even miss him, just a relationship with somebody. But because he’s the only one I’ve ever dated long term he always appears in my dreams."
1006,I'm in these current feels.
1007,"Okay but does feeling like this improve your productivity? 

I feel like whenever i'm in a relationship I lose the time to pursue what I need to pursue. I'm 1.5 yrs away from grad school and it's a heavy workload. 

Whenever I forget about dating I basically go to the same mindset you described! Sex and relationships begin to feel foreign, like something other people do, I feel so emotionally separated from the idea. 

On the other hand that's when i'm the most productive :/"
1008,Sounds like by your life your not even in the right life arena to be in a relationship. I am a woman but I wouldn’t even date anyone who lives at home and isn’t financially independent.
1009,Thanks. Me too.
1010,This is me without the sex. Although I'd say I'm not missing out much since i don't like the idea of sex outside a relationship anyway
1011,I ghostwrote this comment.
1012,"Me too, until I was 34!"
1013,"mmm I hadn't considered that my weirdness is what baffles men, it's probably true though."
1014,"I relate very strongly to all of your points here. I have not felt horny in weeks, and I would be lying if I said I was upset about that. Bleh, relationships!"
1015,I agree with sharing the bed - so annoying! I suspect I've crossed over into crazy cat lady territory (without cats) but it's actually quite nice.
1016,Preach!!! An inspiration
1017,"Sigh. This was heartbreaking to read. I hope you realize that him being an asshole has absolutely nothing to do with YOU. You were never the issue. Know that someone who loves would never treat you like that. 
He broke your heart and it sucks. I sympathize. But for your own well being I hope you've moved on and if you haven't, move towards that. Always remember to find love that loves you back❤"
1018,"Oh my god i just sharply inhaled through my nose ... what a diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick 

Im sorry :("
1019,"This. Even small things like, having a possible love interest sleep over isn’t an option really when you still live at home. Aka one of the most exciting parts of dating someone new"
1020,Mental chastity belt is a hilarious and apt description. Nice lol
1021,"While I agree that living with parents may be contributing, I definitely disagree that by moving out the weight will be for sure be lifted and OP will feel open/receptive/desiring of a romantic and sexual relationship. 

I'm 29 and have been in two very fulfilling, long-term relationships with many short term things in between/after. I was living at my parents only for the first relationship, have been moved out since I was 23. 

OP you're not alone. My most recent breakup (three years ago) happened just before the last year of my masters. Since then, I've dated and hooked up with a few people but I have felt progressively more ""dead inside"" when it comes to connecting on that romantic level with someone new. People have gotten to the point where they tell me they're in love with me and it gets awkward because I don't feel the same yet (this has literally happened to me 3 times in the last 1.5 years).

I think I have struggled with depression (though I've remained functional for the basics) and that has contributed to my lack of ability to derive pleasure from dating. Combined with a difficult and exhausting work schedule (nurse on rotation weekdaysdays/nights/weekends), it's just too difficult. I feel like I have so little time and energy spare, I have no interest in spending it on some random person I barely know. 

At the moment I'm just going with the flow of how I feel, occasionally (rarely) online dating and not forcing anything. My schedule can't be changed for now. I've wanted to make time for therapy but just haven't gotten around to it yet, but I think that will probably be the most helpful thing for me at this time. Not sure if you've been able to speak to anyone but if that's within your abilities maybe worth giving it a try to see if there's anything you need to work through!"
1022,"I agree and I would but rents are very expensive in my area and my parents live right in between my work and school. And it's accepted in my culture to live at home. 

I did live away from home for undergrad but moved back when I found a job in the area. And I dont really make enough to live on my own...and I'd be pretty lonely tbh.

Plus with all this, I havent met anyone and have wished I had my own place for them to come over. I think the living at home certainly factors into it but my friend moved out for the same reason and is now exceptionally lonely and it hasn't solved her problem :/ I have made some friends at school but no one I'd think to date.

Thanks for the input and advice. I'm pretty independent otherwise and have been meaning to travel alone sometime soon (when covid is over)."
1023,"i'm gonna disagree here. i live with my parents and up until two years ago i enjoyed a healthy sex + romantic life. if anything, living at home kept me out of some VERY questionable choices. not because of the fact that i lived with my parents, but since i get love and affection from them i didn't need to reach and be with someone who was unhealthy for me just because i felt lonely. i can see how this would contribute if you don't have the best relationship with your parents, but thankfully i adore my parents and we respect each other.  


re: OP's feelings on dating, it's not just a 'you' thing. the dating landscape is rapidly changing and universally, among my female friends, dating in the ages 24-30 is ROUGH. you're happier alone than you are with someone you're not 100% about. i've been celibate for two years and while i miss sex i don't miss the headaches of rotating through people who don't have their shit together. i'll happily wait for the person who does and whom i truly like."
1024,"I’m 25, living with my parents with an active love and sex life. That comment is just not right. Not having a love interest for 5 years probably isn’t about living with parents."
1025,">  really, really snoopy--not in a creepy way, just in a snoopy parent way. 

Oh okay

> Like, logging into my sister's bank account to see how she spends her money level of snoopy. 

OH OKAY"
1026,"Not all parents are like that so it's not a rule. If you do travel alone to a hostel, please stay safe first."
1027,"I’m so mad at myself for consistently pursuing men who are bad for me. I was just thinking about how earlier this year I went on a couple dates with a guy who was super respectful, took me tree climbing, and generally made an effort to actually have good dates with me. But I wasn’t really physically attracted to him and eventually found myself feeling repulsed by him, so I broke things off. Meanwhile the guy I’m currently pursuing has been leading me on for almost a year, my friends find him on dating apps, and his mental health is nonexistent. I feel like I’m attracted to maybe 1 in 150 men, I don’t even understand my sexuality let alone how to wait for a guy who’s attractive *and* treats me right. 

I have a deep yearning for a fulfilling relationship, I just don’t know how to feel comfortable with guys who are mentally stable :/"
1028,I was raised religious and I have experienced that but I think i've learned to make different choices over time (i hope). Its almost like I had a little competitive streak going in trying to win over bad people.
1029,"THISSSS ALL OF THIS. I actually went through a really hard time last year bc I uH... had a good guy treat me right, and then when he actually asked me to be his girlfriend I was overcome with fear mixed with actual repulsion (that’s the actual weirdest part of this—I become genuinely repulsed by men who seem to actually value me) ((you could argue that I have some kind of messed up sense of self esteem, but I actually feel like I’m pretty happy with myself in general/in every other aspect of my life)). Anyways, it was really cool /s bc after I rejected him, the next day (literally) he asked out this girl who had been trying to date him the entire time (granted she and I had major problems and he knew this). They started dating. I actually became extremely depressed over this, and physically sick. As soon as he started dating her (treating me like trash frankly, and acting like he didn’t care about me one minute and then telling me that he still liked me—essentially messing with my head like no good person would), I magically became obsessed with him and winning his affection back. In retrospect, this whole thing makes me sick, and I wouldn’t stand for any of this behavior if it was between my friends etc... but somehow, even though I promote healthy relationships and encourage my friends to value themselves etc I can’t seem to get my own shit together and it’s genuinely terrifying. 

I almost wonder if a lot of it stems from how I wasn’t allowed to date when I was younger and my parents were really involved with making sure I wasn’t “sneaking around.” I almost feel like because I had to hide my crushes completely and not even interact with the guys I used to like—I almost feel like it created this weird dichotomy of loving the idea of love and being repulsed by+fearful of it at the same time. 

Anyways, I hope we all find happiness somehow. Maybe it just has to be with the right person :,)"
1030,I have the same thing. Maybe it's a fear of intimacy or something. I wish that I knew how to fix it
1031,"https://i.imgur.com/4Rw6SCk.jpg

Sending a screenshot cause I'm on my phone right now, but you might feel at home in one of these two places, or even both. Aromanticism and asexualism are freeing notions, even if they don't describe you perfectly."
1032,"I have interest in sex, but not casual sex. I think my problem might be that the pathways that associate intimacy with good feelings just haven't been used in a while...if that makes sense. It feels and looks foreign to me."
1033,yeah it would definitely be a distraction if I was dating someone at the moment...especially new relationships can be a bit stressful since you are getting to know someone brand new. that's a good perspective to have.
1034,"I guess no one currently in school or between jobs should ever date? Also norms vary across cultures and in mine living at home is not a big deal, especially since our area is very expensive, if I were to move out it wouldn't make sense. Most people I talk to are envious that my parents let me."
1035,Me three
1036,Omg this is where I am at too!! However been seriously looking at adopting older cats so I might cross that line very soon
1037,I'm there and I've got the cat. She is always with me and gets so jealous of other humans (even just friends staying over) so no man would really be allowed in my bed even if I wanted to share it..
1038,"Oh I know it's entirely on him. Over the years we communicated, he made less and less effort to hide his disdain for me physically.   
The last time I saw him, he barely even treated me as human.   


I've never been against finding someone new - I haven't turned anyone down; no one has ever asked. It is what it is.   


I have a bunch of stamps in my passport and friends all over the world, and that makes me happy."
1039,I tried this and it did not go well lollll
1040,"I know you didn't mean to, but this really stuck out to me as something my trans brain really noticed as validating. 

When guys are affectionate to me in this day and age, I'm like ""Why?""

Not that I'm undeserving, or anything, but just that... like, what is your angle. 

=\ probably not a good sign. I hope you find time for therapy and hope it does wonders for you!!"
1041,I guess it greatly depends on the parents.
1042,"It depends on your parents and the relationship you have with them. Not everyone is the same. I could never have an active sex life while living with my parents, unless all my sexual partners had their own place and we would be over there."
1043,"Read Robin Norwood's ""Women Who Love too much"". I found myself in so many situations like yours. The book was a great help."
1044,"I do the same too, but not raised religious. I think I’ve made some progress, but I still loose interest just as quickly. I have no idea how to change this."
1045,Ah right. Just misunderstood. I guess sometimes sex drive is a use it or lose it sort of thing.
1046,"In between jobs? No I don’t think so. There are clearly bigger priories in your life. I’m assuming you live in the western world? Where is living with your parents normal when you’re a full grown adult?


I said I wouldn’t date someone like that, because they simply don’t fit into my life. I can’t speak for anyone else."
1047,Me four.
1048,Do it! The only reason I don't is a lack of outdoor space. Cats are lovely.
1049,That makes me happy too. So good to hear that you’re making the best of your life and experiencing the beauty of existence even though things aren’t perfect. ❤️
1050,"It really does. I've had multiple people over at the same time occasionally, but my parents are really accepting."
1051,"Yup, that's how it feels :/"
1052,"Immigrant communities exist in the ""western world"""
1053,A lot of the adoption pages in my city for older cats seem to be for cats with FIV+ so it actually fits better for me since I also don't have a lot of outdoor space for the kitty! I've been doing a poll with my friends and you're no5 to say get one! Haha oh nooo
1054,I’m also an immigrant.
1055,"You should definitely take advice from internet strangers.

Edit: satire. I was joking, I support the cat adoption plan!"
1056,lol ok?
1057,Point being it doesn’t at all sound like you’re ready for a relationship. Maybe work on yourself first. If you don’t want to be in a relationship...then just don’t. Not sure what’s so complicated about that.
1058,She's not asking for your opinion on what your standards of social norm should be or what you would do when looking for another companion. Her post has nothing to do with what you think about dating and she certainly does not need your judgemental permission to not date.
1059,She literally asked “is it just me” the post wouldn’t exist unless it was soliciting opinions.
1060,"Something that helped me when I first moved out of my parents' house and got to experiment with clothes and makeup in my own style was to realise that 99.9% of strangers in the world are too busy worrying about how they look to care about how I look.

I used to worry about what people on the bus might think about the length of a new skirt I was trying out, or if someone might judge me on how I did my makeup as I walked past them, and it all went away when I saw that no one ever made a single comment about how I looked.

With family it's different, but I think with this sort of thing you gain more confidence the more you do it. So maybe it'll help to focus on how they might comment on it at first and make you feel awkward and uncomfortable, but when you see that it doesn't kill all of your confidence you can try it again, and if they make a comment on it again, it'll feel a little less bad, until you eventually get to a point where you just stop caring about being judged by others."
1061,"People will comment on the change, but they'll get over it once it becomes routine.


I had a tomboy 'glow up' around your age, when I went from androgynous clothes to actually fitted, feminine clothes. Even my teachers commented on it! I was mortified at first, but then after a while nobody noticed or cared anymore."
1062,"Do you have a good friend? Go shopping with her/him and try out some really silly clothes in thriftshops. After you tried on a unicornvomitedsweater with orange-green tassles your new clothes will feel rather tame. 

Your family and friend wil comment on it but who cares? Mostly they are giving you compliments anyway, right? And if not, ask them what horrendous things they were wearing as a teen. They probably have a lot of funny stories about that. 

Fashion is to be experimented with. So go for it."
1063,"I usually start with a piece that I really like and incorporate it into my existing wardrobe. Whether it's a stylish jacket or a new cut of pants you can usually mix and match with your existing style and start adding to it as you expand your wardrobe. If anyone comments on it just answer confidently or take what they're saying as a compliment. For example ""Wow that's an interesting jacket!"" ""Thanks isn't it beautiful? I couldn't pass it up"". Don't let others get you down and rock whatever style you choose!"
1064,"I wore a long conservative skirt and bare feet when I walked my dogs the other day. I thought I would be out of the ordinary, but in that same walk I passed by another woman in a long conservative skirt (with combat boots) and a different barefoot woman. 

It helps being in a medium sized city, but even if you’re not you can be 100% positive that whatever your style, someone out there in the world thinks it looks rad and is wearing it too."
1065,My Favorite Murder! If you’re into true crime at all.
1066,Still Buffering! Three sisters of different age groups talk about what it is / was like to be a teen. Lots of current and 90s cultural references. Love it.
1067,"The Dildorks, it’s sex and relationships focused but they give the great advice is want to hear from a friend! Plus Kate and Bex are like actual best friends, and really funny to listen to."
1068,"Call Your Girlfriend! It's a podcast for long-distance besties everywhere co-hosted by Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman! The back and forth is fun, insightful and something I look forward to weekly ❤️"
1069,"If you watch any of the Real Housewives/Vanderpump Rules/Bravo reality shows, B\*tch Sesh is a really funny and great podcast! I absolutely love it and you might know Casey Wilson (Happy Endings, Bride Wars, Gone Girl, etc.) and Danielle Schneider (HotWives) or some of their guests. Overall, one of my fav listens every week because I love Real Housewives and I love them!"
1070,Best Friends with Nicole Byer and Sasheer Zamata
1071,Listen Hunnay with Jeannie Mai
1072,"""Ask Ronna""! It's so funny and Ronna and Bryan are so refreshing and relaxing to listen to. It's like a brunch with your aunt and her younger friend."
1073,Thick and Thin by Katy Bellotte!
1074,I love listening to Girls Gotta Eat! The conversations they have are down to earth and hilarious!
1075,"Be There in Five! The host, Kate Kennedy, is hilarious and very well spoken. She mixes pop culture with nostalgia. Honestly I don’t really care about pop culture topics, I just truly appreciate her take on things. She also does some GREAT deep dives that are really interesting!"
1076,"Glowing Up is my favourite podcast, it was esther from my crazy ex girlfriend and alone together (idk of you are familiar) its two comedians talking about how to glow up. They stopped making the show unfortunately but it's worth a listen"

1079,Most piercings involving a clamp are just that. Quick pinch
1080,"Helix was fine. Not any more ore less than lobes.

It's the after care that's more awkward"
1081,honestly thought getting my lobes pierced was more painful than my helix
1082,I'm usually a big baby when it comes to pain but both my helix piercings and earlobes were a breeze. A pinch and slight burning sensation afterwards but nothing crazy. I've had broken nails that have hurt worse 😂
1083,I think there is a time and place to dump your problems on some one. Does reaching out means only to talk about your problems? I dont think so. Reaching out can mean that your friend distracts you without knowing it. It can mean admitting you are having a rough day but not discussing it further. Reaching out as far as you are comfortable.
1084,"Try reaching out and talking about something positive. I know it’s hard. Especially when nothing feels positive. Keep your head up. You can talk to me, anytime, about anything. Dump all your problems on me, or don’t!"
1085,Thank you for responding. I guess I don't ever feel really comfortable reaching out. Are you comfortable sharing a time when a friend distracted you? I don't think that's ever happened to me and it sounds like it's something that helped you. What happened when you told someone you were having a rough day?
1086,"Thank you for responding. How/what/when is a good way to reach out about something positive? I'm sorry, I'm not asking to be difficult or rude, I just really don't know and it sounds like this works for you. Are you comfortable sharing an example?"
1087,"First it doesnt fee comfortable at all. But you see how they enjoy themself and it is nice just to forget your problems for a while. Get out of your own head and focus on the activity (My friends are quite energetic and love to drag me through the city). I do this with friends that arent that close to me.

When I tell my closer friends that I am having a rough day they normally ask me if I want to talk about it and if I need something. Sometimes we talk briefly, sometimes I tell them that I wil be okay and want just to enjoy the day with them. My bestfriend often tries to cheer me up with jokes and hugs me. Knowing that I could talk to someone if needed is sometimes enough for me. And sometimes we talk and cry with eachother. I do this only with my bestfriend."
1088,"Like even the smallest positives. Drinking enough water, getting up and ready for the day, any small accomplishment is worth sharing! Anytime, too. I think overall what I'm trying to say is just talking to someone and getting whatever you need to out, will help in the end. What makes you uncomfortable about reaching out?"
1089,"Thank you for sharing, I'm very glad that you have a best friend and that you feel better talking to them."
1090,"I just don't understand the rules of when and why I should. I would never in a million years think to text or email someone if I drank enough water. And if someone texted me that, I would think it's really weird. I guess I don't feel comfortable even reaching out about something positive because I don't get anything out of it, and the effort of it makes me feel worse, so why bother?"
1091,"I don't think there are any rules. You don't have to text or email anyone, if you don't want to. Maybe that's why I don't have friends... I be texting people make sure you drink your water! Haha. What I've learned the past few years about my mental health is you just have to start doing things and eventually you'll feel ok. You don't need to reach out to people if you're okay without doing so, but if you're not okay then you gotta find what you need to change"
1092,"Tried one, and honestly, I don't see much of a difference. Think you're better off spending your money on a professional grade service."
1093,I have one.. It didn't work. I should have spent the money at an actual treatment.
1094,I got the tria 4x and after 14 iterations most of my facial hair is gone. It seems to be working *really* slowly on body hair but for the thick androgenized hairs it's great. I do have the pasty white/dark black hair combo though so ymmv.
1095,Honestly I just skip wearing them altogether and just wear pajama bottoms or leggings. It gives the area a chance to breathe.
1096,Aerie has the best underwear and they have fun animal ones a lot.
1097,"Ngl, I normally sleep in my boyfriend's boxers, they are so comfy!"
1098,Victoria’s Secret (not pink) high rise briefs.. they have some cute prints and they are soooo comfy and never gives me wedgies
1099,Sleeping in no underwear is my way to go
1100,MeUndies or Aerie
1101,"I wear gap stretch cotton.  It’s comfy, cute and comes in different styles."
1102,"I sleep in loose PJ shorts. I have a pair of boxers too, those are probably my favourite."
1103,"If I wear leggings, or anything with like...too much stretch, I feel like my lady *can't* breathe. It might be psychosomatic (I am known to be neurotic), but nice, comfy cotton undies always feel the best for me.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
1104,"Oh man, I'm jealous. My butt dimensions crush his butt dimensions...so that's not possible for me!"
1105,This. Although their latest material doesn't hold up nearly as well as ones from a few years ago.
1106,"When other women look at me:

Is my outfit okay? Do I look stupid? Do I have something on my face? Am I on my period, did I bleed through? I bet I look homeless right now.

When I look at other women: 

Oh she's pretty. I love that outfit. Where did she get that? I wish my ass did that. Do I want to be you or be on you? I love your hair. Lets be friends"
1107,"I’d either assume that she didn’t like me that much (but that depends on how she looks at me), that she might like me, or maybe I just look interesting to her. I’ve done the same with other ladies, and I think women have a tendency to admire other women and look at each other more often."
1108,"As a bi woman who is terrified of being rejected by straight women, I'd probably go ""oOoh she thinks I'm pretty what iffff . . . come on moveshake don't be ridiculous 95% of the world is straight"" and then move on with my day"
1109,"That she thinks I’m ugly, but that’s just on my insecurities."
1110,"Is it a neutral/positive stare or is her face disgusted?

When I’ve caught other women, it’s been positive/neutral expressions. So I figure:

- they think I’m interesting in some way (face, clothes, bike, etc)
- I look like someone they know
- they find me attractive (I’m also into women, so you can kinda tell when they extend the eye contact a smidge too long that they might be interested-interested)
- I just happened to be in their line of sight
- they’re just looking for no particular reason at all
- they want a subtle way to gauge getting your attention/something from you eg “can you sign this petition”"
1111,"I kind of do that too. I'm a straight woman, but I do think women can be really pretty and I usually look at them more when I admire them. But I'm also an artist and sometimes I stare and think about how I would draw them. 

If I caught another woman staring at me I might think that I have something on my face."
1112,"Eh, it's usually the hair."
1113,"If someone ever seems uncomfortable from me looking at them, I always just smile and tell them, “I love your shirt/makeup/ etc.” it usually puts them at ease."
1114,"It depends on the kind of stare. A glare means I must be doing something wrong or have my skirt tucked up. 

A normal stare I'd probably think she's admiring my outfit or something"
1115,">(I’m straight)

Are you sure? 😜"
1116,"I always wonder what women are thinking when they stare at me (I prefer woman) I think...are they assessing the goods, or assessing the threat...lol I still think a lot of women are perhaps protective of who they're out with or themselves if that makes sense"
1117,I just smile at them. They usually smile back. It's better than making assumptions for no reason whatsoever.
1118,"I'd assume I had a fashion faux pas going on, they thought I was moving in on their man, or didn't think I belonged. 

Do yourself a favor and go up to her and say you haven't been able to help staring, she has really unique whatever it is that stands out to you, and it reminds you of ... whatever it is that makes you stare, and that you've always been envious of people who have that sort of style, because you don't? I don't know, compliment, and drop in the ""my boyfriend"" or ""My husband"" or ""the dude I'm seeing"" so she gets that you are straight, you just have no social skills."
1119,"I assume they’re thinking that I look like someone they know, which I get a lot. 
My husband always thinks they’re thinking ugly/jealous thoughts, but why assume the worst when you can assume the best? You have no idea.
When I get caught staring, I’m either a) trying to figure out if I know her from high school, or b) admiring her style."
1120,Be hoping she was into me. 😚
1121,"I knew a chick who was like that. I finally asked ""Uuh... Is there something on my face?"" She smiled, said ""Nope, I checked"" and went back to her doodle"
1122,"I stare at someone because I like the way they look or carry themselves. But there are times it has backfired because I have a chronic RBF. I have no idea what others think of me, positive I hope."
1123,"Nah, I just think you’re wondering how I get my strip
Lashes on or how I get my hair so big- I also out of effort in my appearance and I stare at other women (not intentionally) and appreciate their style, hair, eye colors etc. it’s normal and human."
1124,"I usually assume she is lost in thought and it’s not actually paying attention to me, her eyes are coincidentally in my direction. That’s what happens to me when I’m lost in thought, I simply blank out and often appear as if I’m staring."
1125,I would just assume she’s staring at me cuz I’m not white in a white majority area.
1126,"That she's trying to decide if she knows me or not. 

Cause that's almost always why I'm looking at people."
1127,That I have food on my face or my lipstick is smeared.
1128,"Could be so many things, that she thinks I'm pretty (in a straight way), that I have something on my face, that she likes what I'm wearing or what I'm wearing is weird, that she feels like she's seen me somewhere before, that she knows someone who looks like me."
1129,"I have a huge problem with staring, it’s just what I do and I don’t care anymore lol. Come say something if you have an issue."
1130,"If I am staring unblinking at another women, she is either:

A. Acting like a complete ass in public or
B. One of the most magnificent humans I have ever laid eyes on and I just can't help myself. If she is Dolly Parton/Michelle Obama level, I might even start crying"
1131,"I would assume it was a staring contest, and proceed to win it."
1132,My hair is bright red and 2.5 feet long so they’re probably looking at my hair
1133,I would think that she is possibly daydreaming! But that might be because I'm constantly daydreaming and people think I'm staring at them🤷🏼‍♀️
1134,"There’s not one single thing that I would assume because there’s a lot of possible reasons that a person would stare at me. Maybe they think I look good, maybe they think I look bad, maybe they’re just lost in thought, maybe they’re people watching, maybe they like me, maybe they think I’m interesting, maybe they dislike me, maybe they’re curious...etc, etc"
1135,"As a known bisexual, I would literally never assume a girl is into me if she was staring at me. I feel like that’s absolutely straight girl territory lmfao. I would just assume she likes something I’m wearing."
1136,Lol I do the same thing so I just always assume the other woman is doing the same too and then I like to try and get them to notice me staring even harder back at them. Usually they are zoning out too so it's always fun seeing their reaction.
1137,I would think there was somethinh wrong like I had TP on my shoe or something 😳 So i usually check myself
1138,I just think they’re curious. Maybe they like my outfit or are wondering about my life
1139,That she is judging me because I've had a lot of obvious cosmetic surgery.
1140,Maybe there’s something up with my face or hair
1141,That hopefully she’s admiring something 😈
1142,This is why I wear sunglasses in public places. I stare are people all the time!
1143,"Well I thought I was straight and did this a lot. Took me forever to figure it out. So I bet some of them are assuming you’re like me instead of straight. But it’s not what people always jump to, they’d probably have to have personal experience with someone like that in their past. 

I assume they want something from me."
1144,"If I see someone staring at me, I give them a nice smile. I try not to worry"
1145,"My first instinct would be she is about to say something to me and she is framing what she is going to say. If enough time has passed and she is still looking, I would assume she either recognises me from somewhere or is trying to remember where she has seen me before."
1146,"depending on her facial expression during the staring and her appearance, neutral stare and neutral appearance:  
\- she´s zoning out/daydreaming and I happen to be where she looks at  
\- she thinks I´m wearing something unusual or look unusual  
\- I have something on my face or clothes (would check my face and clothes)  
but would assume different things if it was a butch lesbian (would be flattered I guess) or if she had a ""crazy""/psychotic stare and vibe, I´d be scared"
1147,Same.
1148,"I knew I wasn't the only one ha! These are my thoughts. 

We ladies are incredible wonderful, I like to admire others girls, even thought I'm straight. I just control myself to not look like a creep."
1149,"> Do I want to be you or be on you? I love your hair. Lets be friends

Just friends? 😂"
1150,Womanhood encapsulated in one post. Bravo.
1151,I’m glad it’s not just me
1152,"Me a bi woman: “every woman but me is straight”


lol"
1153,"Hey, you never know 😉"
1154,oh no :(
1155,I need to start doing that. I think I make it awkward cause I don’t say anything.
1156,ayyyyyy
1157,I wish everyone thought it was normal!
1158,"Let’s hang out and stare at people together lol 😝


In high school this girl in my class thought I wanted to fight her cause apparently I looked at her for too long 🤨"
1159,"Or maybe she wants to ask who does your work, because it looks so good."
1160,"[Fitnessblender](https://www.fitnessblender.com) is really good and offers pretty much something for everybody! Highly recommend!

Edit: typo"
1161,"I like [MrandMrsMuscle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi_J6WNj99ro-9cPZOUrf8Q/featured), they're focused on HIIT and there's a diversity of workouts, like cardio, abs, full body, low impact, intense etc. Also, they upload new videos everyday. 

&#x200B;

Oh, and thanks for the recomendation, I'll check blogilates out!"
1162,I love Mary Helen Bowers' Ballet Beautiful. It's on youtube and it's amazing.
1163,Madfit is my favorite!
1164,"1. Check this email was sent from a legitimate Yahoo! server. This might be spam. Look at the actual email address this came from, and if it's not something short like [info@yahoo.com](mailto:info@yahoo.com), or [donotreply@yahoo.com](mailto:donotreply@yahoo.com), it's a fake. This looks real to me, but it's ALWAYS good to check before you click anything in the email.
2. Change your password for your Yahoo! account, and any other accounts that share that password. 
3. If the email is real, click that link under ""didn't sign in recently?"" and remove ALL devices/apps. You can always sign back in, the hacker won't be able to after you change your password. 
4. Enable 2-factor authentication - it's called ""two-step verification"" on Yahoo! Mail. Sign in on desktop, then go to the top right hand corner where your name/icon is. Click on it, then click Account Info, then Account Security at the lefthand side of the page. Then scroll to the bottom, find two-step verification, and add a phone number!"
1165,"Someone else is trying to get into your account, time to change up that password."
1166,"Don’t click on any of the links in the actual e-mail. Just open a browser and go to yahoo and log in that way. Once you’re logged in change your password to something really secure. Enable two factor authentication if they have it! Also most sites have a way to report suspicious emails to them, you should be able to find out on the yahoo help page."
1167,I know there are websites where you can see if your information has been sold/bought or any websites that have that information that have been hacked/had the info leaked somehow. I just don’t know what the names are
1168,Change your password and go to remove all decided and set up two factor confirmation like someone already said! 😊
1169,I’ve got this exact same thing!!!! Three times. Two from Vietnam and one from Portugal. I changed my password to an “apple strong password” and haven’t had any more issues 🤷🏻‍♀️
1170,"As someone else mentioned, far-and-away the *best* way to defend against this attack is to use two-factor authentication - go set it up right away!"
1171,"Also, if this email is from an illegitimate address, DO NOT CLICK ON THE LINK.  If you are not sure, DO NOT CLICK ON THE LINK. Go directly to [yahoo.com](https://yahoo.com) instead and reset your passwords there directly and see if you can get to the section about recent logins there directly as well.   Same thing applies to spam phone calls because it is easy to spoof another phone number. Just call back the official number, and say you missed a call from them. Do not provide any personal information if you are receiving a call.

I know this isn't what you asked for / might be old news, but just because it's related, make sure to set the privacy on your social media to limit who can see information like your date of birth, hometown. This kind of information is often used for identity verification and it's easier for someone to steal your information if you make this publicly available. Likewise, if you get tagged in those public facebook posts to share top 10 facts about you, like ""what's your mother's maiden name"" (ok, maybe not that extreme), just don't.  They tend to include questions that are again used for identity verification, and is used to scam people."
1172,This has been happening from one of my instagrams a lot lately. Different place every time and it’s happened about 4x now.
1173,You might also want to take the time to look into 1Password. They are a password manager company that keep track of all of your logins for every website and you can use it on all your devices. They also allow you to create unique and very hard to crack passwords using their auto-generator function.
1174,":/ This happened to my hulu account in a country I'd never even heard of, then to my facebook (which was deactivated) in pennsylvania a week later.

Still no clue how they got my info or why someone would want to get into my fb.

Changed the passwords (was the same for both of those accounts) and everything since the has been fine.

Still a nagging feeling of unease, I feel ya."
1175,"Change your password! Now! Dont pass go , dont collect $200. Just do it!"
1176,r/scams
1177,"It happened to me too back in 2015,  I changed my password and set up 2- factor authentication.  It fixed the problem"
1178,r/RBI
1179,Everyone else has given great advice. I want to add that this can also sometimes happen if you're using a VPN and the VPN server is overseas.
1180,Help with.....?
1181,I got the same email yesterday. I just deleted it.
1182,"Never, ever click the link in the email! Type the address into your own browser. Too easy to hyperlink."
1183,Never ever ever click links from even legitimate senders to reset passwords or anything with accounts. Open a separate tab and manually go to the website yourself!!! Obviously with all yahoo accounts being compromised she needs to reset the password and set up 2fa if she really feels the need. Honestly it looks like it was a program automatically doing trial and errors until it gets into an account. My really old hotmail account has multiple unsuccessful imap syncs from all over the world randomly multiple attempts over a few hours that stops for a period time then starts again.
1184,"I got a similar email from Instagram sometimes back. It was from ""Malaysia"". I didn't use Instagram much so I logged in to check and everything was okay."
1185,Considering how high up your post is. Please edit it. You do not ever click the links. Go to the website yourself and do it.
1186,"Also, if Yahoo mail has that function, enable 2-factor authentication, especially if it's your primary email account. I have it on my primary email account, since I'd be screwed if I lost access to it."
1187,https://haveibeenpwned.com
1188,"I did that but it just told me there's like 9 billion ""pwnd"" accounts. So like, thanks for the stats but like now what?"
1189,I got this same email a few days ago as well. Changed my password and set up 2FA just to be safe
1190,"Seconding 1Password. Glad to see that, along with two-factor recommendation, showing up here -- I can also say that a USB key is your safest bet for two-factor. A phone number/SMS text for two-factor is definitely better than nothing, but a key is even better."
1191,"Yup, I've had my accounts hacked a couple times and using a password manager I think has helped a lot. Up until I started using 1Password, I was using just one password for everything.. and one weak link (a website that had all its accounts leaked) was all it took for several of my accounts to get hacked."
1192,Came here to suggest this.
1193,Damn that’s dangerous though
1194,I just changed my IG password and engaged 2FA - bullshit hackers.
1195,[deleted]
1196,"Similar thing happened to me. I've been using 1password for a while now and no hacks since then, plus I'm horrible at remembering passwords so this has been awesome for me."
1197,"Maybe I should have elaborated more in my original comment. I mean, I'm definitely not going to click a link in an e-mail even if it looks like it is from Yahoo. The whole point is to not interact with suspicious e-mails when you receive them. 

I'm not sure what other advice anyone would be seeking beyond the obvious? Delete it and change your password through Yahoo's website and not a link.

1198,What's dangerous about deleting it?
1199,Not remotely true
1200,If you delete it then it explodes.
1201,"God, you are dumb as fuck everywhere."
1202,Evidently you don't know what a joke is.
1203,"Ive only tried the Braun silk epil. I love it so much i have two ( one for face). The older one has a tiny head attachment that you can use on your eyebrows.  

I also have an ipl lazer - Phillips lumea. I love it. It doent remove the hair, it turns it blonde and fine so when i epilate i don't get ingrowns anymore.  I used it every other day for a year. Now i use it once a week."
1204,"I’ve used braun and Phillips over the last 15 years. I won’t sell you on one brand over the other but advise you to start mid calf, not right on the bone or right on the ankle because they hurt more. 

Possibly also have a glass of something before you start. 

The first few times it hurts. But each time you do it, it hurts less. I now do legs, pits and face (yay for PCOS) and now there is no person at all and i only do it about once every month or so."
1205,"I've used Braun Silk Epil. Started with a 7 on a 9 now, the attachments I've found are very handy for doing all areas."
1206,I've had the Philips satinelle for SIX years and it's fantastic. The head is removable and washable but I find that I barely have to clean it beyond brushing stray hairs out
1207,"Honestly? Look on Groupon for laser hair removal (once the pandemic is over, of course). I got my entire body done for ~$200 and it lasted about 4 years."
1208,"I have the Emjoi epilator [like this](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B073GQ3ZXW/ref). 
 It works amazing well, both on my body & face. No matter what brand you decide to go with, it is best to get one with as many tweezer heads as possible. The more tweezer heads there are, the quicker & less painful is will be. I also think it's better to get a corded version rather than battery operated. You don't want it to die halfway through!"
1209,"Epilators can ruin your legs. I had so many ingrown hairs after a few months of usage.  It's also very sore, like 100x worse than just waxing. The first time I tried it I had to have a lie down after.

If you are looking for more long term I'd save up for one of those Phillips Lumeas or go for waxing instead."
1210,"I bought an epilator as an alternative to expensive waxing (and when I wax at home it takes ages). I can only stand doing from the knee and down, and even then it hurts like a mf. It just hurts so fucking much when I get to the thighs, etc. HOW DO YOU GUYS DO IT? I am so disappointed that I used almost 300 dollars on something that sucks. 
On top of the pain, i get just as many ingrown hairs as when I shave..."
1211,"Braun silk epil 5 - it's the mains kind and it has different attachments if needed.
It lasts longer then shaving I've stuck to epilating and I have a high pain threshold. I use it on my arms, legs and underarms. Yes I have had ingrown hairs or hairs just under the skin on my legs but exfoliation does help plus it's a cheaper option for removing hair."
1212,I epilated for years and ended up getting bad folliculitis from it. I had to go on antibiotics for 3 months! So be careful. I'd definitely recommend laser instead! Much less painful and lasts for years.
1213,"I've been a big fan of the Braun Silk Epil line. I haven't tried any others. I have been epilating for many years and now my legs and underarms have very little hair, and it's only blonde! I  also like it for the fine hairs between my brows - in 5 seconds I can clean that vs tweezing. I basically use it anywhere but my face!"
1214,"I’ll check both of those out, thanks! I’m so tired of shaving, but I can’t stand it when my legs feel scratchy and prickly lol"
1215,Have you used the laser for your armpits with any success? Just curious because that is my body hair struggle spot lol.
1216,"I need to know more. Does this work on the bikini and back area? How good are the results?
I thought you had to shave your hair before using it, so how come your hair is going blonde?"
1217,The one you use for face - how large is it? I’m looking for one that can do my stache during this Covid quarantine since the one I use for arms/legs is too large.
1218,"Braun already comes with two faces, one for sensitive areas, and the normal one"
1219,I’m definitely going to check out both. I didn’t know the laser was even a thing.
1220,"I start at my ankles. Then I cry a bit. Then I do the rest and swear a bit.   

Then I hop around the house in my underwear to give me time to consider if I really find it so important that there is no armpit hair sticking out from under my t-shirts.  

I must say doing it in this order, combined with internal dialogue after doing my legs, make my armpits look like chewbacca quite often. But hey, my legs are soft as silk!"
1221,Second the drink. Seriously.
1222,"I have had a 9 for a while now and it was never all that great to me - in a lot of areas, especially the knees, it breaks some of the hairs instead of pulling them out, meaning I need to epilate at least once per week to remain smooth :/"
1223,"also don't waste money on a dry & wet one, epilating doesn't work great on wet skin"
1224,"I have this one too, and I love it!"
1225,"I have this one and I think it's crap tbh. I am going to get one like the Braun eventually and I think the main difference will be the angles of the blades. The Satinelle is straight and most others have two or more alternating angles. The Satinelle for me works on coarse and long hair but on shorter or softer hair it just breaks it. I don't end up with more or less ingrowns, I just end up with a lot of hair that doesn't get pulled."
1226,"ohhh i've been very tempted to use it on that area too, is it hard to maneuver? is there any chance to end up with half an eyebrow gone? lol"
1227,"The lazer really helps. I shave once a week, if that and my legs are silky smooth. 

I use the epilator without its guard
 It looks scary but its not and it works much better that way."
1228,"Yes, that worked the best. That was the first area to be hair free without top ups."
1229,"I use it everywhere, even on my face. I epilate first and the hair grows back fine and blonde instead of thick and dark. I used it every other day or few days on my bikini line  for a year. It takes me 5 mins. After a year i only use it once a week ( i have gone two weeks) . My under arm hair stopped growing after 6 months. It has completely stopped me getting ingrowns on my bikini line which were a huge issue.   I even think its helped with my stretch marks but that might just be my perception."
1230,Its about 2.5 inches without the guard. I do my stash with it.
1231,I've never found it to be super effective for knees either!
1232,I use it wet for the more sensitive areas. Hot water helps!!! My underarms are so bare that I now do those dry though.
1233,to each their own!
1234,"Well I am very experienced so I find it easy. I just go super slow and back off a lot to make sure I am not overdoing it. I even do the top of my.brows sometime, it is just so fast!"

1236,"Awesome, I'm going to look into getting one! Happy cake day!"
1237,"Thanks, I have the same issue of ingrowns in the bikini area. Seems like this could be a universal girl problem. Will invest in this once I can buy it online 🙏🏼
I’m wheatish to fair, I tend to get tan and have darker legs. Hope it’ll work on me."
1238,maybe it depends on the epilator because I haven't had any in-shower luck but I do like to epilate right after a shower (since I can exfoliate before and I swear it hurts less since your pores are more open!) so same idea there
1239,"I send them jokes, picures etc. to lighten their mood. I save my questions for phone calls."
1240,"Last night my friends and I all got on discord and played Jackbox Games together (this is not an ad).  I hosted the game on my computer and used the Live Streaming function on discord so everyone else could see the screen. Jackbox has everyone go to [jackbox.tv](https://jackbox.tv) and enter a room code and then we can all play together.  Its trivia, bad drawing, word games, etc."
1241,"I think it's really thoughtful of you to be making such a conscious effort to stay connected! 

I also go with jokes/memes as a little way to keep in touch, especially since it helps serve as a tiny break from thinking about current events. 

I haven't done this yet, but I've seen it recommended a bunch: a virtual happy hour seems like a fun idea to stay connected & socialize. You could also do a virtual coffee break or even dinner. And, I think I heard Netflix launched a ""party"" option (or maybe is launching?) where you can watch shows with your friends."
1242,"If you google “questions to get to know someone” there are a ton of fun creative options! Could lead to some nest conversations, and it could definitely help you guys learn new things about each other :)"
1243,"Despite there being a state wide 'stay at home' order, I too still have to go to work as an ""essential"" accountant(!?). My company does work for the department of transportation & city public works departments. Anyhow, my sister is at home with 4 kids, ages newborn - 6 years old. Schools & daycares are closed for at least another month. Poor thing, I just can't imagine the daily chaos. At least before the older 2 kids were at school & preschool for a good part of the day. I send her jokes, pics of my of boring day, funny videos, ect. At least she gets a 10 second break a few times a day to check her phone. Her husband is home, but he's working. She's on maternity leave, so it's up to her to wrangle the kids most of the day."
1244,"I am in the same boat as you. I am still considered an essential employee and am working on site in my industry. I try and check in with friends often and send articles that they might be interested in, especially for those who are not working from home, but rather have an abundance of unexpected free time now. I have been trying to set up video calls with those far away and I talk on the phone with those who are close. (I prefer phone calls over texting anyway). I am looking for some co-op games to maybe start connecting during nights and weekends, but so far haven't found much that's been interesting and engaging. 

This couple I know is setting up nightly zoom meetings for everyone to relax and have a drink and catch up, but I've noticed that their friend groups don't really overlap and I'm essentially in a chat room with a bunch of strangers and a few acquaintances, which is fun for a short time, but I can only do that for so long."
1245,I did this with my friends too! Our favorite was quiplash
1246,Did something similar last night with friends! Jack box is a life saver in this situation
1247,"My sister and I both did this separately with our friend groups too! Seems like the thing to do now :p

PS they’ve made Drawful 2 free or on super-sale, and a lot of their other games are on sale too!"
1248,Sounds like so much fun! Thank you for the suggestion!
1249,My husband’s work does a virtual happy hour and they love it! I guess I just never considered it for myself! Thank you for your ideas :)
1250,I can see how a little bit of boring would be a nice thing for her! That’s a great idea!
1251,"Co-op games are a great idea! I could also start making the most of my 30 minute drive home by calling friends and family... would help me be less salty about the commute, even though traffic has been non-existent!"
1252,"Get a routine happening. Wake up at the same time every day. Get dressed. Enforce time away from your screen. Set some daily goals and track your achievement of them each day. I keep a daily journal (I did this before Covid-19) and it has helped to know the date/day of week, reflect on the distinct details of that day, etc. 

Some of my daily goals, as examples:
30 min of reading on paper (book, magazine etc)
30 min yoga practice
30 min visual art creation (right now this is literally colouring in, but it rests my eyes from the screen and is soothing)
Making love with my partner
1 hr fresh air. Maybe a walk, maybe just hanging out on my balcony.
Reach out to a friend or family member online. 

That last one can help to make each day distinct, because it can be a different person each day."
1253,What do you want to use this time for? What does your best quarantine life look like? (Naps is a valid answer)
1254,"Having a rythmn helps. Getting up early, eating at X, and just schedule your life. If you find yourself with extra time consider picking up a hobby? 

I completely understand. I pulled my back nine days ago and have been bedridden. Definitely difficult to adjust to."
1255,"Ok my day is get up when I would have done before. 

Use my commute time for either yoga or a Pilates class

Sit at my laptop at log in time. 

Take a lunch break and read a book or go for a walk 

Work the afternoon

Put my laptop away to Mark the end of my working day

Use my commute time to chill out

Basically I make sure that my timetable hasn’t changed. I have now managed to make a separate space for workout before that I made a point of taking out my laptop and putting away my laptop to signify the change in scope."
1256,/r/hobbies has been posting some ideas on ways to pass time
1257,Using a vibe for extended periods of time can cause temporary changes in sensitivity. It sounds like you just need to take a break for a day or 2 and it will be back to normal. Happens to me after extensive... fun having... too where it’s sensitive but also not sensitive.
1258,"> my clit is really sensitive. Even touching it with my fingers, I can barely feel any sensation


I'm confused, you're saying it's desensitized but then being too sensitive? Which is it? 

Either way there's no permanent damage. Just take vibrator breaks to readjust your sensitivity levels, and mix it up so you're not mentally/physically dependent on cumming in a very specific way."
1259,"I doubt it. Just from personal experience, using a vibrator has never affected the amount of pleasure I receive with a partner or the ease with which I can receive it. To me, sex and masturbation aren't even comparable. I have sex because I love sex and I masturbate just to get rid of an urge or fall asleep. Or boredom. Sure, you may be overdoing it and you're feeling the difference but it's not anything to trip over. Just leave it alone for a couple days."
1260,"Hey! Exercise is a great way to boost your mood and feel good. I'll link two of my favorite ab workouts here

Chloe Ting has a lot of good workouts. I also recommend watching Vicky Justiz's stomach vacuum videos. You usually can't target fat loss but you can tone your abs. Add in some cardio too, avoid high sodium foods, drink plenty of water. A clean healthy diet with lots of fruit and veggies helps."
1261,"The time I lost the most dramatic amount of weight was when I broke my leg and had to hobble on crutches. I couldn't go to the kitchen every few hours to snack, and I also just didn't feel that hungry since I wasn't doing any exercise. I learned to eat ONLY WHEN I WAS HUNGRY, rather than set meals just because it's food time (eg I didn't eat breakfast because I had no earthly reason to, being sat in bed all day). 





**You lose weight by burning more calories than you eat, there's no tricks.** You burn calories simply by being alive, so exercise isn't even necessary. While exercise is important for your health, you have to be more mindful of what you eat because it could stimulate your appetite. All it takes is one 200-300 calorie energy bar to completely ""undo"" your workout."
1262,"I use the eat less, move more thing. 

I simply eat less junk (I count calories to help keep me on track).

I move more - an hour of cardio and Mary Helen Bowers' Ballet Beautiful vids from Youtube - the core one especially. It'll kick your ass, but also tone it up and make stronger muscles, which you know, burn fat. 

WHen I first started tracking my food, I was shocked. I had no idea how many calories were sneaking into my life. Mostly empty drinking calories."
1263,"I'm the same age and I notice I pick up weight in the winter these last several years. I have to drop 10 at the beginning of every year now.


I count calories. I have a pretty healthy diet just by my food preferences so calorie counting is kind of easy for me. If you have a hard time with it, maybe try a specific diet. The main thing with calories is to make sure you aren't drinking all your calories. So if you like soft drinks and Starbucks, that's going to be an adjustment. And stick to just liquor/soda water if you have a cocktail.

I use a 1600 calories limit, tracked with the myfitnesspal app. I use the treadmill for 45 min then do a 10-20 minute workout with light weights. I can knock off 10 lbs in a month. 

IG accounts I love: @alexricee and @kimfrench87

I use this video a good bit:

https://youtu.be/NVTykly35W0

As far as bellies go, you can't target fat. The only way to reduce belly fat is to reduce overall fat. So that sucks. But it is good to know."
1264,I find intermittent fasting to be really helpful.  Heck out r/intermittentfasting.
1265,"Thanks for the advice. My body is definitely addicted to sugar, and I find myself eating a lot of cookies and chips just because I want something sweet or salty. My plan is to stock my fridge with healthy snacks and stop eating crappy food."
1266,Sugar can make a huge difference. If you eat a lot of sugar start by cutting out or reducing one category at a time. Sugar filled drinks are probably one of the worst culprits.
1267,Thanks! I enjoy yoga more than traditional cardio stuff (jogging isn’t any fun for me). I’m going to art putting yoga into my daily routine again.
1268,Thanks for the advice!!
1269,"Cardio isn't for fun - it's about getting your heart rate up and keeping it there. I prefer dance videos or similar for my cardio, or zoning out on the eliptical while watching Netflix. Jogging has always been the WORST."
1270,"Look up a TDEE calculator, this will tell you how many calories your body burns just to survive. I subtract 300 calories from this for my daily goal. This results in a 1 lbs lose every 10 days."
1271,1 lbs is 0.45 kg
1272,"Stress can absolutely make your period late. Of course it would be wise to take a pregnancy test to put your mind at ease. It is more common than you might think for your period to be late in times of high stress or big life changes. I personally have a very touchy cycle that is affected by stress, illness, travel, ect. I have even completely skipped periods during extremely stressful times. It freaked me out & I took about 10 pregnancy tests the first few times! But it seems normal for me & my doctor said it's normal & nothing to worry about."
1273,"110%. It’s one of the leading causes of a late period

Edit: hormones rule your body! Cortisol is the stress hormone. It’s the devil"
1274,Yes!! My periods are pretty regular but I’ve noticed on the months were I’m actively keeping track and worrying about it made my period come a couple days late.
1275,Absolutely it can!
1276,"Yes, stress can delay your period! I was so stressed from work and then stressed for being late once that my cycle lasted 48 days. Yup. 48. I ended up just giving up on stressing and went to get my hair done, came back and voila! I’d spent sooo much money on tests and was coming up with all my worst case scenarios. I know it’s easier said than done but just drink some tea if you can, maybe wash your hair or paint your nails, and know what no matter that you’ll be okay! Take the test when you are able to but know that our bodies can feel stress heavily and result in super late periods."
1277,"Yes. Last month I had some stressful situation in my job, I knew it, but as everything was alright my period came. 

Try to relax, if you think this epidemic is making you feel bad, maybe try to distract yourself."
1278,If it really bothers and concerns you talk to your gynecologist
1279,Just started curology for tretinoin and I'm ready for the purge lol
1280,I’m having a deep purge and dry skin from tretinoin right now! Get ugly to get good later!
1281,I’m growing out my eyebrows haha
1282,Also a great time to start to wash your hair less often!
1283,ugggg I dont wear my retainer cuz it hurts tho. and my prescribed routine is to wash my face twice a day but I keep doing it once.
1284,"Can confirm, am trans and being at home where no one can see me for the first 6 months or so of HRT is gonna be an absolute BLESSING."
1285,"I'm tempted to shave off all my curly hair. I want to do something extreme. But I don't think it will be received well, or that I'll look good."
1286,I have Frida Kahlo-esque eyebrows and they are bushing back out since I haven’t been anywhere...
1287,"I’m glad I’m not the only one finding this ‘time off’ a blessing in disguise with regards to beauty routines! I’m trying to live a more minimal/low impact/sustainable lifestyle and it’s relief I can finally trial a ‘low shampoo’ and deodorant ‘detox’. I’ve been putting these off for years because I was so anxious to feel gross and smelly at work around friends. Now it’s only my very understanding partner and me and when I do go out for a short walk in the park I don’t have to worry people coming too close to smell me...

I’m case anyone’s wondering, the hair routine is going better then my homemade gentle deodorant which doesn’t seem to do much. I use 2x week rye flour to cleanse my scalp (got a pixie cut) and then rinse with diluted (homemade) kombucha vinegar. Still figuring out what I can do to make the hair smell nice though. I can’t seem to get used to the very natural smell (my partner said it’s not bad but reminds him a bit of helmet hair after skiing..."
1288,I’m excited for you! My curology tret prescription has transformed my skin. ☺️
1289,Yes! And to experiment with different hair products and routines. And makeup styles.
1290,I wish I could do this but I just can't take how disgusting it gets after 3-4 days. Such a greasy mess ugh :(
1291,Yeah my mouth is killing me lol. Ok just biting the bullet because I was getting an obnoxious tooth gap
1292,You're going to come out of quarantine all glowed up like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon lol
1293,Ooh that is extreme. How long is it now?
1294,"What is this for? 3 people have mentioned it now, I’ve never heard of it!"
1295,"To my shoulder blades when curly, down to midback when straightened (I've got a lot of bounceback). I cut off about three inches this morning. Maybe that will quell the urge to chop it all off and make myself look awful."
1296,"It's some company that makes custom, or supposedly custom (never used their services so I don't know which it is), products for acne."
1297,"You tell them your skincare problems + send photos, and they'll make you a custom prescription. Just started so I can't say how effective it is yet 


Eg my concerns are hyperpigmentation and aging, so my formula is niacinimide, tranxemic acid, and tretinoin.


Tret is rx only, so unless your docs prescribe it, the only ways to get it are via a service like curology or by some generic Indian pharmaceuticals online lol."
1298,It’s a custom mix and they also make anti-aging formulas.
1299,"And that is that, thank you. Out of curiosity, how good are they really? Because I know I should start taking better care of my skin (yeah, it just ... kind of slipped past me, I've been trying to pick up the slack since last year but I'm not exactly the best at it yet), but due to conversion rates and other stuff their products seem kind of expensive to me (like, I could get some higher-end stuff for the same cost)."
1300,"My personal experience has been amazing. I’ve tried so many things for my cystic acne and now my skin is the clearest it’s been for years. I could seriously cry looking at my skin I’m so grateful. I think it’s most worth it if you have tretinoin in your mix because that’s an rx grade ingredient and I tried getting it at my dermatologists before and it was twice as expensive with insurance. I’ve also tried the 3 ingredients in my formula separately and didn’t have the same results so I think they really do work synergistically. I will say if you want tretinoin you have to specifically ask for it. I’ve also never had any problems getting my curology on time or asking for a bump in the ingredients. They also have more percentage options of tretinoin than the pharmacy. If anyone is interested my formula is 0.09% tretinoin, 7% azelaic acid, and 1% clindamycin."
1301,I tried it for a few months. Pretty underwhelming. My skincare products end up costing way less for higher potency/better quality than Curology. You can find the components that Curology uses at $10-15 for a bottle that lasts months.
1302,"I'm video calling boyfriend and putting on a little ""show"" each night.

With my parents and big sister it's proper phone calls, although that's beginning to get strained as there is nothing to really talk about right now."
1303,"It’s just my mom and brother; I live with my mom, so that’s covered and my brother lives in another state. I have been doing my best to text him everyday, but he also tends to distance himself which can be hard. He’s doing ok, all things considered, but certainly very concerned.

Everyone else, plowing through; quite literally one day at a time for all of us."
1304,WhatsApp and FaceTime
1305,Video chatting definitely helps! And I understand what you mean about running out of things to talk about. Nothing is really going on unless you/they are working.
1306,I agree completely. I think most of us can only take it one day at a time at this point. I hope you and your family stay well!
1307,"I'm putting a brave face on it but I'm struggling with the lack of in person contact, video/phone calls are a poor substitute for me.

I've just got so used to interacting with a lot of people all day every day and now it's totally flipped."
1308,It really is a huge adjustment. Hang in there!
1309,"Down Dog is another yoga app, and it's free until May (longer for teachers and students I think). Tried it out for the first time this morning and it's really customisable which is cool.

The Royal Opera House and National Theatre have announced they'll be doing livestreams of shows via YouTube.

As someone who is chronically ill so has already had long periods just at home, I could have used all of this stuff before haha! But making the most of it now and it's good this is being offered to help us all through this."
1310,A lot of restaurants that offer delivery won't charge a delivery fee! I know Chipotle is one that does it but it may depend on where you live!
1311,"Fender is giving 3 free months of guitar lessons.

Rosetta Stone is giving away language lessons to anyone with a kid in k-12. I don't remember the exact details on how long that one lasts but it seemed like a good deal when I read about it.

Both are posted on r/freebies"

1314,"please get checked out. after having mild periods all my life with little cramping, i started to have these symptoms (nausea, fatigue, migraines, hot flashes, nerve pain) and it turns out i have a large fibroid in my uterus."
1315,"i've always had a ""mini flu"" with my period too. i've no idea why, sorry... I just treat it as i would any brief illness, take some ibuprofen, drink water, and rest."
1316,"I just take some painkillers and relax. I always get hot flashes, migraines, nausea, etc on my period too. 



Last time this happened was a few weeks ago, when I was at the airport running like the devil so I wouldn't miss my transfer. I'd just come off an international flight where I suddenly got my period on the flight (yay me). I was overheated, probably had a high temperature, was sweaty from running, delirious from exhaustion, in pain, etc. I was like, ""oh shit this is probably what coronavirus looks like"". Had there been a temperature screening, I probably would've failed lol."
1317,Had this w a non hormonal iud. I couldn't function at all. Got it taken out after a year and went back to the pill. Doc will probably suggest the pill if you're not on one already to reduce severity.
1318,"You can absolutly do something about it. My gynecologist checked my blood and hormon levels. (My iron was low...) I also take some medicine with Alchemilla xanthochlora. I am still tired but my migraines and feelings of sickness are gone. 

PS: I dont know the name for  Alchemilla xanthochlora in English so Latin had to do it."
1319,If she has a full migraine she shoudnt take the pill.
1320,"I really think the only thing you can do to calm yourself down is to take the test. Don't worry. I've thought I was pregnant and got worked up about it even when I DID use birth control. Back when I knew less about sex and such. No harm in taking a test. 

I would recommend using contraception next time."
1321,"The pullout method is really not effective. If you don’t want to get pregnant, I’d suggest trying to get on the pill or use another form of birth control, and definitely use condoms. The risk of unwanted pregnancy isn’t worth the slightly better sensation of not using protection."
1322,"The number of days before your period you had sex will be a factor in how likely you are to be pregnant. 

But really if you had your period it's very unlikely that you are pregnant. 

You sound very stressed. Stress can contribute to changes to the reproductive cycle and could explain your later than usual period. 

6 days late would freak me right out too but it's not so late that it's necessarily an indicator of anything. That's probably within a 'normal' range of variation. 

Birth control used to make me anxious too, to the point that I stopped taking it. So that might contribute to how you're feeling if your body is adjusting to new hormones. 

Take control. Take the test."
1323,"Yeah, I'm on BC now. We used a spermicide along with the pullout method and he did not finish inside me. But there is still a risk."
1324,"Did your doctor recommend the boric acid? I’ve never heard of that; not sure what the side effects would be. I think it’s pretty unlikely that your period was actually a miscarriage of a single twin. I agree with other commenters, you’re probably not pregnant but take the test to make sure and to ease your anxiety. Different BC pills can have different side effects. I think the lower abdomen/back pain could possibly be related to that. It takes a while for your body to adjust to different hormones."
1325,"My pH was too high and I saw boric acid helps bring it down. I'll take a test tonight. Have to do it in secret because I live with my conservative, Catholic latina mother."
1326,"If you can, I think it would help if you go to a gynecologist. They can talk you through what actually works and is healthy and safe."
1327,"Maybe you can purchase a dye like the other commenter suggested. 
r/cleaningtips are really friendly, so you can always ask there if you don't find answers here."
1328,I know that you can buy dyes in all kinds of colors. Maybe email North Face customer service and see what they recommend
1329,"Awesome, thank you."
1330,That's a great idea. Thank you
1331,"I epilate everything from my neck down.

Pros: cheap one of cost, several weeks of being hair free (5 weeks for arms, legs, underarm and all the fluffy stuff elsewhere, 3 for pubic hair)

Cons: the most painful hair removal method I've done (shaving and salon waxing are the others I've done), ingrown hairs occassionally (when I first started I got a lot, some really big and noticeable spots), needs a few millimetres of hair growth to do (you'll have a few days of being prickly), takes several hours to perform effectively, be prepared to contort yourself into weird positions to get everywhere.

Once I've done it I use exfoliating gloves all over every day, wash and moisturize."
1332,"Epilator.

It's going to hurt at first especially on more sensitive areas like the stomach but after 2-3 sessions you don't feel much and it gets easier.

One of the best purchases I've made as someone with fair skin and dark hair. Do make sure to exfoliate before to avoid ingrown hairs and move slowly in small sections! (you'll have the urge to run it over your skin quickly because of the pain at first but this breaks the hair)

Edit: I'm not sure if an epilator works for the face though - I thread those hairs."
1333,"I use a tinkle razor to remove all the peach fuzz on my face. They’re good at removing the side burns as well.

Have you tried waxing? Recently I tried sugar waxing, all you need is sugar, water, and lemon/lime. It’s super cheap and once you get the hang of it, it’s amazing. It leaves your skin so soft and smooth. There’s plenty of YouTube tutorials out there on it."
1334,"I epilate my arms, legs and armpits. But doing pubic hair seems scary. Any tips ?"
1335,"Thank you! I have never heard of a tinkle razor. I have considered sugaring, but I don't want to have to wait for the growth before doing it again."
1336,"While it's painful to epilate your pubic hair, certainly the first time, it's not totally intolerable.

Things you can do, take a painkiller before you epilate, do it in the shower with the hottest water you can tolerate, have something to bite down on.

Afterwards I dab some facial toner on my intimate area just to calm and refresh down there."
1337,"Younger girls put up with so much more - they have no defenses. There’s a ton of guys who feel more comfortable with someone like that, and it’s really telling."
1338,"This is something I’ve noticed as I’ve gotten older. I’m 24 and I can honestly say the most I’ve ever been catcalled has been when I was 15-17. Where I used to be scared of going to the beach because of the attention, now I can generally walk around  without being yelled at by older men. The kicker is I have definitely become more attractive — nobody peaks in attractiveness at 15 years old. I thought it was some kind of cultural pedophilia tbh (not originally from the US) but being an easier target is an easier pill to swallow."
1339,"I am 27. I was sitting by myself in a Panera Bread and two older men (50-60) started talking to me. Kinda annoying, but nothing bad, at first. 

Then they started asking me, why I was alone? They said I was ""well behaved"" for someone so young. They guess my age was 17. How long was I going to be there? 

I commented they were 10 years off and I was married, the immediately left. I was so uncomfortable."
1340,"""is it because I looked like an easy target?""

I mean, yeah, pretty much. Predators are going to go after easy targets and kids are naive, easy to manipulate/gaslight/control, and physically weaker."
1341,"Yep. I had a similar experience. Now that I’m older and have more of the don’t give a fuck attitude that comes with aging, men don’t actively prey on me like they used to and some are even intimidated. I used to get a lot of creeps when I didn’t know anything about the world, and the older I get, the more I realize that the cluelessness is exactly what they’re looking for."
1342,"I also was catcalled at 12.. I was tall for my age but not an early-bloomer in any other way. I also dealt with lots of creeps online when I was young, and out in public.

I'm 30 now and I might as well be invisible. It's nothing like when I was a teen. Maybe I got that RBF down pat, but likely I just don't seem as young/vulnerable anymore.

I think some people are attracted to young women/girls more than we know, unfortunately. If you look up the statistics, they're shocking. You're four times more likely to be raped between the ages of 16-19. **1 in 9** girls will be sexually abused by an adult before the age of 18.

Source for the above statistics: https://www.rainn.org/statistics/children-and-teens"
1343,"It's a common experience, and imo proof positive that sexual harassment is about power, not about sex. There are plenty of really hot women in their twenties, thirties, forties, fifties.... etc. But older men don't get gross with these grown women: why? It's not because they aren't attracted to these women. It's because they know they can't intimidate or shock grown women, and the women are experienced at handling gross guys. These men aren't *attracted* to young women, they just get off on shocking you and making you uncomfortable. It's all about power, not sex."
1344,"I was watching ""Tiger King"" on Netflix and one of the guys there had a cult/harem with a bunch of young girlfriends. It was really sickening how easy it was for this creepy old guy to influence these young girls with his money/tigers/lifestyle/etc.

I think creeps understand the young girls are more impressionable and (for lack of better words) easy targets"
1345,"I would get that all the time as a young teen, especially when I was wearing makeup. I guess I looked “grown” but also adolescent enough to be a target to them. Now I have bags under my eyes and I look fed up so I rarely get bothered anymore."
1346,Yep! Happened to me past 18 too as I looked younger than my age. Then if I told them my age they insisted I must be younger. I think they just wanted me to be.
1347,"this is why Chris Hanson was so popular.   


There are some crazy old men out there. Please be careful! They don't even care if they never met you in person either. When I use to work in customer service it was always the old geezers who would masturbate over the phone going over their bills.  


This was the only time we were allowed to hang up on people. My supervisor took it to the next level and always reported them to our security division where they would call the old fellas back and tell them if they whip out their old willy wonka again and do that, we would be calling the police"
1348,"Yeah, I got catcalled a lot as a teen. Teens make easier prey."
1349,Absolutely. And yes older men are always the culprits. I never get hit on by guys my age.
1350,"Yep. Happens to me way too often. I had grown men grab my between the legs as soon as 9 years old. At 13 my boobs grew large, while I still had a small body. Men loved that too much. I’m 24 now, but still look near 17-18 and grown men especially like to watch me. When asked why I’m not in school during the day, I say because I graduated highschool almost 10 years ago when I was 17. They lose interest really fast.
Men are encouraged to prey on little girls with teen porn, fetishizing school girls, and society in general sexualizing underage girls so early."
1351,"Definitely true. ill never forget the first disgusting comment I received from a stranger. I was around 9 or 10.

As perverted as it is, I think the bigger driver for disgusting men to make comments to young girls is that they are more vulnerable to those comments and don’t know how to stand up for themselves. I’m 27 now and I have places to be and shit to do, I am no longer the lowest hanging fruit."
1352,"I think the older a woman gets the more experienced, confident, and intolerant of men’s BS she gets. Men don’t like that. They like young and dumb and easy to manipulate. That’s why so many of them groom young vulnerable women."
1353,"Yeah, men have normalized going after younger girls because they’re more naive. In movies you always see the old guy with some very young woman.

As for my personal experience on this: When I was 13 my friends and I used to hang out with older guys. My friend was dating some dude who was 25. I always felt a bit iffy about it so I hung out but always rejected any attempt to be more than friends. Good thing because my friend who was still 12 at the time lost her virginity to this dude because he had told her “that’s what mature people do in relationships” and he was dating her because she was mature for age. 

That’s manipulation and he was a predator. That’s just it and it’s scary how many young girls have this experience.

I’m 22 and even 18 year olds look like babies to me. Always beware and wonder why they aren’t with women their age."
1354,">Also, are there really that many pedos out there? Just looking back, I can't believe it

Some places (like the US) have sites featuring a map of all registered sex offenders; plug your address in and unless you live in one of those ""pedo-free"" cities your area's gonna light up like a Christmas tree.

And these are just the ones who made it onto the registry. 😞"
1355,I was thinking about this yesterday lol. I don’t get hit on as much now compared to when I was younger.
1356,"I got a lot of attention from older men from 12-20, as soon as I stopped looking underage most men left me alone."
1357,"Yup! 14 to 22ish I got hit on ALL THE TIME. 

To be fair, I was in the best shape of my life those years, clear glowing skin, and just all around happy and bubbly. BUT many of the men hitting on me were over 30. Super gross. 

Yes, this is definitely something I have thought over a lot lately. I use to think it was 'normal', but now, as a woman in my early 30's I really see the big picture. Lets take Porn for instance! Its kinda hard to find a decent porn worth watching because so many of the girls look UNDERAGE to me. Even though they are legal, they look like children, and the men in the videos look my age. Its pretty upsetting."
1358,"I started thinking about that a lot once I hit 30. I've been getting harassed by men since I was 12. At one point when I was living in a big city, daily sexual harassment was the norm. Once a guy stopped mid pick up line to ask how old I was. 

I hit 30 this year and suddenly realized that I almost never have to deal with the shit I used to have to deal with on a near daily basis from such a young age. 

I can't decide if it's due to men preferring to creep on girls that look young and helpless and give them the reactions that make them feel powerful. Or if it's due to society changing for the better. Probably a bit of both."
1359,"From 12-20 (I developed very young and had huge boobs) it was pretty constant.
Then from 20-30, it slowed down. Now? Not at all.

Oddly enough, I posted a throwback picture on instagram of myself at 17 and all of a sudden my dm's were hopping again? Weird."
1360,Yup! I’ve noticed the correlation. And judging by everyone’s comments it’s v common. Here was me thinking I was just prettier when I was younger but now I realise no those men were just creeps looking to manipulate young girls. Gross
1361,"I don't get hit on ever, but I've seen it happen to some people I know so I get you. You're probably right about them being easier targets since they're more vulnerable"
1362,"I am now 27 the age my ex/abuser was when he started controling me and getting into my head when I was 15, grooming me. I fell for it until I was 17-18 and remained trapped until I was 20. Ive still got psychological shit to unpack and process because of it all. Theres a much much bigger story but no context is needed to make this point-

Now as a 27yo I can't wrap my head around it. I volunteer with a local drama company and so I work with a few 12-17 year olds occasionally and hell, I can barely even bring myself to type it hypothetically but how could anyone see that age group in a sexual light ugh!! I see them having fun just enjoying being kids and it sickens me to think that when I was that age, someone saw me as something sexual & not only that but as something that they could claim.

Legal age is 16 here. That's why he was able to groom me from 15. Sick sick sick sick."
1363,"Man it's so true. One of my more funny stories is I was at Costco, I was wearing my usual guy skinnier jeans, but probably a tank top and had my hair in pig tails. One of the few looks that make me look very feminine and girly. This guy around 45+ walks up to me. Dude wasn't bad looking but he was definitely way out of line when he approached me. Even in the middle of the crowded checkout lines. Couldn't believe his balls. This was some 10 years ago now, so I forget what his opening lines were. I was so dumbfounded when he followed in with ""so.. you in school?"" I did nothing but laugh and he became so u comfortable he ended up switching lines. I was well in adult age by then, but that made it clear what he was out for. It's just so funny he got that I comfortable from me laughing at him to slink away."
1364,Years ago I saw this extremely unscientific article about which women were “more likely” to get groped and I think I’ve actually noticed this effect too over the course of my own style evolution: https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/women-who-attract-chikan-and-women-who-dont-an-illustrated-guide
1365,"Same, I was nerdy and chubby, yet always got cat called by random older men... I only realised how wrong it was when I became an adult and after it stopped. The saddest part is that pretty much every girl friend I know went through the same exact thing. The thought that there are so many men out there who themselves have families (and daughters!) and think it's okay to cat call a teenage girl is nauseating."
1366,"I’m pretty sure like 99% (I pulled that out of my ass, but a lot) of women were first “hit on” by older predatory men during puberty or early adolescent years. That’s when I started hearing cat calls and gross comments from creepy older guys, anyway, then it stopped into my later teens when I looked older. Predators know they have better chances with young teens who don’t know any better which is why they’re more blatant about it."
1367,"Same things used to happen with me. Lots of guys used to message me through MSN or Facebook and invite themselves to come see me (although none ever did). I’m 27 now and everyone tells me I look so young, those who don’t know me think I’m around 14-16. And sometimes lots of guys approach me thinking I’m a teenager, creeps. 
I don’t wear revealing clothes, but during summertime, I feel hot a lot so I like wearing shorts and tank tops. And I hate noticing men checking me out! Ugh. And yeah, a lot of men seem to prefer younger women, but I honestly have no clue why. Most of the guys I dated or been friends with always used to say they prefer older mature women. So I don’t know why there are so many creeps out there."
1368,I think that the 'creepy men' and 'men who hit on teenagers' are less of a venn diagram and more of a circle.
1369,"The most I’ve ever been catcalled and stopped in the street by older men was when I would walk home in my school uniform when I was around 11-13. As a teenager, there were quite a few men that I knew who would hit on me - men I worked with, teachers, the “perfect dad” next door neighbor, etc. I was babysitter then a nanny, and more often than not the dads would get creepy."
1370,"I used to look way younger than I was. Without fail, everytime I was creeped on and harassed in public, it was buy someone who thought I was 15/16ish.
 
Without fail, everytime a stranger hit on me or chatted me up in a non-predatory way in public, he thought I was in my 20s. (Except onetime when a teenage boy hit on me and it was very awkward cause I was definitely into it until I found out he was 17)

Theres absolutley a pattern"
1371,"Ugh I got so much more shit from men on the street when I was younger. I remember vividly how it started at 14, and was the worse from 15-18. And yea, it’s about power, cause even though I personally think I’m more physically attractive now and wear more revealing clothes, I get less. Cause that shit doesn’t matter. They just fucking like you to know that they’re more powerful. 

I also had to learn early on not to be afraid to yell at these pervs, but I’m glad I did. I never let anything slide except for a few times I was really put off guard. I’d always yell back."
1372,"I got more unwanted attention at age 14 than at age 21 which angers me so much. Looking back at photos of me at that age, regardless of how “mature” I felt, it was VERY obvious that I was underage. Hell even the way I talked was a dead giveaway. It fucked me up so much because as kid you are told to listen to adults and then when you start going through puberty, all these adults that you could have counted on may try to take advantage of you.  I didn’t have the experience nor the mental ability to navigate it because I wasn’t fully an adult who understood the situation. 

Now that I’m a full blown adult it blows my mind on why anyone would want to date a young teenager. Like, if any of my guy friends starting pulling that shit, I would admonished them and cut them off if they don’t stop. I had a coworker in his late twenties who started dating a girl a week after she graduated high school and I ended up just avoiding him because it was very obvious of how the power dynamic was (she finally left him when she went to college after a few months)"
1373,"Some men seem to want someone they can easily intimidate and manipulate, so young people are often targets. I really don't miss being young, I've been sexually assaulted by entitled men so many times I've lost count. I've been hospitalised by assaults. Men ignore you when you're their age, and that's fine with me. If you face them with confidence then it's unexpected and can throw them off. So sorry you're going through this now."
1374,"Yes. Men followed me around in public when I was in my teens. Older boys at school said and did horrible things to me and other younger girls. I’m 40 now and my relatives are still fond of telling me, “You look like you’re about 12.” Some of it is how I dress, I guess, but still. And yeah, it still happens. Even men who are younger than me do that stupid shit that I think of as “I’ll be your domly dom.” Like they infantilize me and talk down to me, and seem to genuinely believe this is flattering and attractive. 

In the last year or so I began developing laugh lines around my eyes and a silver streak in my hair, and much to my relief, I am noticed less and less. Well, I’m probably still noticed, but I’m being dismissed as a potential target now. I hear a lot of women complain that as they get older they are increasingly ignored, and it just ruins their lives, and I just keep thinking, “Why?! This is awesome! What a fucking relief!”"
1375,"I was also thinking about this the other day. Grown men tried to pick me up at the mall when I was 14, and I would get appreciative honks from passing cars. I do think I looked older, though—maybe 17; however, I think it was my youth they found attractive, whether they knew it or not (not much else to see since I was also pretty nerdy!). Now that I’m 35, I’m mostly invisible, but we live in a very different world than it was 2 decades ago. I wear earbuds all the time and have permanent frown lines, so putting aside my actual age for a moment, I doubt I appear very approachable."
1376,"My work environment has a few older men who give me bad vibes. They usually say off handed sexist comments or comment on my looks/weight (I look young for my age and am petite). One guy has directly told me about his attraction to young women (he's around 50+, divorced with two young girls, and dates exclusively 18-23 year old girls). It's gross. I'm 23 and he flirts with me constantly, asks me if I'm still with my bf (he has since then mentioned how he dates married women), and has asked me to try on leggings for his startup business (hard pass). I could go into detail about how gross he is but I'll tell you what he's done most recently. He asked a 19 year old co-worker out to dinner, to which she refused and he continued to try to talk to her online. I got her to block him off everything and told her that if he has a problem with her, he can take it up with me.

Luckily, these guys are at most creeps and egotistical but aren't a serious threat to me. I hope any other women out there who feel unsafe or subject to harassment speak to someone they can trust."
1377,"I walked alone to and from highschool as a teen, I had a baby face, but large breasts. It was obvious I was underage re, though.  Men would pull over ALLL the time to ask if I wanted a ride.   A lot of the times they'd offer a compliment first.  I should have told my parents, and I'm glad nothing happened to me. 

I was also on the internet in the early days, and the creeps were there too. I remember telling a 30 year old guy to meet me at the mall parking lot, I didn't show. 🤭"
1378,"It’s honestly so gross. I remember when I was 12, waiting outside a shop and 3 guys in a Ute kept driving past cat calling/saying they wanted me to come with them. I was waiting for my dad to pick me up and I didn’t even tell him because I was so embarrassed. I felt like it was my fault."
1379,"The ancient Romans held orgies with child sex slaves so humans (mostly men) have always been this gross. I personally fantasize about teeping them all in the solar plexus and grinding their genitals into dust under my heel. 

I genuinely believe they all deserve the death penalty (though realistically I'm against capital punishment)."
1380,"Yeah I got sexually harassed a lot more when I was a child/teenager. I’ve been followed by men on foot and in cars, groped, catcalled and spanked (that was an awkward one because my mom was with me). 

Now, no body bothers. The most I put up with now is the occasional weirdo following me in a shop. I put it down to the fact that I drive now and a lot of those things happened on the street or on public transport. But now that you mention it, maybe it’s because I’m in my late 20’s and it’s starting to show. Also helps when you have a kid with you, they’re a pretty good deterrent."
1381,"Yup. First time I was groped I was 11. Around that age people thought I was old enough to drive because I was tall but that still isn't an excuse.
I'm 23 now. The creeps have actually slowed down a bit when I'm not wearing makeup. When I put effort in my appearance I have to be more careful."
1382,"Happened to me too, starting around 12. Men who suck are drawn to barely pubescent girls because they are presumed by men who suck to be naive, compliant and easier to manipulate and abuse than adult women.

You could probably plot the correlation between age and men who suck hitting on me by my age, but also by my weight. I gained quite a bit when I was on hormonal birth control and the come-ons petered out completely.  I thought it was because I was past 40, but it turned out to be because I was past 180. I went off Mirena, the Mirena fat melted away, and the come-ons came back.

For years all my social media profile pictures have been goofy. Just a few days ago I put up a new one that was supposed to be goofy but actually turned out quite flattering and makes me look way younger. Right away I started getting friend requests from random horny dudes from everywhere. I had completely forgotten about those.

It's a funny old world. I wish men who suck would not do these things."
1383,"I was hit on pretty regularly from about 12-27. I would be told creepy shit or deal with older men trying to put me in vulnerable situations all the time. 

The day I got married, I was 26. My husband and I were checking into our hotel after the wedding and when my husband went to get the bags from the car, a creepy AF man who’d been behind us in line came up to me and said something like “he’s a lucky man. You don’t look a day over 15.” I was so disgusted. 

I’m 30 now and last year I battled through an illness that really wore me down. I had a long period of time recovering from surgeries so now I’m about 15 pounds heavier which has filled me out. I think both of these things have made me look more my age now. Interestingly enough, I’m just about invisible these days to those older creeps!"
1384,"I feel like I have the opposite problem now. Guys obviously younger than me trying to hit on me and I say ""I'm too old for you"" and walk away and then laugh when they try to say ""but age is just a number."" I could have babysat you in high school boy..."
1385,"> is it because I looked like an easy target? 

yep, exactly that."
1386,"Yes definitely.  Same reason why ""teen"" is the most searched for term on porn sites.  I was hit on so much by creeps when I was 13-17, when I looked like a literal child.  It's sickening."
1387,"Yes, there are that many pedos out there.  I've been hit on creepy men since I was 10 years old.  My body also developed at an early age which meant I was a target for creeps and predators out there.  My mother would never allow me to wear shorts or tank tops for this reason although at that time as a child, I didn't understand why my mom was being so strict.

One incident stuck out in my mind when I was 10 and at the time I was living in a condo with my family.  I used to go out unsupervised to play in the playground which was very common back in the day.  This guy who lived in the building would always ask me if I had a boyfriend and he wanted me to go up to his place for lunch.  I would try to avoid him but when I couldn't, I'd always be polite because I was always scared.  I never told my mom. 

That incident along with many other things made me hate and blame myself for a long time."
1388,I got the most attention between ages 11 and 20. I’m 34 now and nobody even looks at me. It’s crazy.
1389,"I wish this would've changed from the age of 15, but even at 32, it's pretty much the same, except less touching and grabbing. 


Cat calls, harassment, trying to talk or convince me to go out on dates. Still happening. And it didn't matter what I was wearing."
1390,"Once I was about to walk under a bridge and there was two guys on top of it working on the rail line. One yelled down asking how old I was, 
“I’m 13!”
One of the guys punches the other guy on the shoulder and said “I told you so!” 

13."
1391,"I’m currently 22. I remember as early as 13 that I was creeped on and flirted with by a cashier in his mid 20s. I felt like I was a magnet for older men. The amount of unwarranted conversations and unwanted attention was unsettling. I still get it from time to time but it’s gross how much older men targeted me in high school, especially online."
1392,"I get hit on or gawked at more by older men. Like 40’s-60’s. I’m 23, it’s funny my mom who is in her fifties gets more attention by the younger guys close to my age or in their thirties. I always thought that was a weird switch."
1393,"I’m 22 (just turned!), and when I was 20 if I didn’t wear makeup, people thought I was 16. Some of them guys, and that kind of lit a spark under my ass and made me think, “well shoot looks like I need to wear makeup more often - don’t want to attract the wrong men.” 

Once I wore it regularly I got no more comments - I asked my sister how old I looked with makeup and she said “like you’re 19 or 20.”

Side note I do *not* wear makeup because of this - I just really like playing with it and wearing it!"
1394,"I've noticed this too, I'm now 26.

&#x200B;

It is because we looked like easy targets. It may also have to do with how you now currently carry yourself. Personally, I carry myself much different than when I was younger. People still creep and make me uncomfortable, but I would say I'm more prepared for it now than I was 5 years ago."
1395,Yeah funny that! It all stopped when I turned 48... it’s been a long time coming but now I’m invisible!
1396,Those would be the pedophiles. They are a human form of cancer.
1397,"Yep. I was followed home by a man repeatedly in high school and turns out he was notorious for following and harassing other teenage girls in my town. I also was hit on a lot when I was like 10-13 on the Internet with my photo up. In hindsight I’m lucky I had some common sense because attention from men is exciting when you’re young. I also looked older as a kid so that gave these men an excuse. 

I’m 21 now. I feel I’ve grown into my features and I now look my age. Men refuse to talk to me. I still have my fair share of older men hitting on me but not in the magnitude of how it was when I was a child."
1398,"Absolutely. When I was a nerdy teenager, I would always have creeps hitting on me. I’m short and have always looked young for my age. When I worked my first retail job, same thing. As I got older, more secure, more confident, and probably started to look the age I actually was back then, it stopped."
1399,"I started waitressing at 14. I got hit on by old creepy men I waited on a lot then. I waitressed a bit last summer and I was 21. I was sexually harassed by a coworker, but not by customers."
1400,"Yes I'm 24, very short very young looking. I still get older men asking if I'm 16. No fuck off"
1401,Yup. I was harassed and had older men catcall me and hit on me online alot more when I was younger. I had a young looking face but was an early bloomer in other ways . Now that I'm older I notice guys staring at me more instead of just straight up being a disrespectful creep
1402,"I’ve actually never been catcalled and I always thought it was due to me looking half a decade to a decade younger than my actual age. I have zero curves so maybe that’s why. I’ll be honest the lack of getting hit on made me feel like the ugliest girl in the world. Just recently I started getting approached by teens on the streets that think I’m their age. Most my friends have been creeped on by older men though and the one that received the most harassment actually looked significantly older than her actual age. It might be the area that I’m from? 

Online, I’ve only posted pictures on my personal private social media accounts. When I was 12 I created a MySpace,  my friends and I joined a random chat and I actually got messaged by an older teenager to delete my account because I’m a child."
1403,33year old male here. That makes me sad asf. There is a dude in the UK hunting pedos. Type pedo hunter into YouTube.
1404,"I think about that every so often.  Looking back, I see how many grown-ass men, guys with daughters around my age, high-school teachers, college professors, and adult coworkers would openly flirt with me when I was a teenager. (There was this 60-year-old OB-GYN doctor who I knew because of work, and he was SUCH a creep. I felt and still feel really bad for his patients, because there is no way his creepiness was limited to being directed at just me.) I realized they were flirting even back then, but I didn't mind it, but now I find it SO creepy. I guess they like the idea of fresh, innocent meat. Disgusting? Yes."
1405,"I agree. When I was 15-20 older men, strangers, were way more attentive than after I grew into my 20s. The last time a creep hit on me was when I was 21. I've been hit on since, but not by way older dudes. I'm 29 now."
1406,"I didn't realize how many creeps I'd encountered when I was 13 until I was older. Fucked up thing is that they were online, and I craved attention back then, so it all felt pretty normal. I'm just glad nothing terrible happened"
1407,"My sister has a similar problem.  When she walks our dog she gets people talking to her a lot more, not just people hitting on her just people talking to her including older women/our neighbors.  When I walk the dog no one says anything.  I think it's because of two reasons, the first is women are more approachable and second guys are desperate"
1408,"When i was 12-14 i had SO MANY grown ass men trying to hit on me, or ‘hang out’. Not just abstract guys on the street, but guys in friend groups i was around, who i saw every day, and who met my mom. I’m almost 17 now and i do not get it at all anymore. Creepy. I feel bad for my friends who actually fell victim to the men."
1409,"Under the age of 18 I had many statutory types of ""relationships"". I have since come to terms with it, put my guilt to rest, and view the guys as creeps now. It's awful, because I feel that I *know* that many men are open to taking advantage of younger girls."
1410,"There’s a reason that women their own age aren’t interested in them, too. I found that a lot of the guys my friends and I were with were super immature (rude, not communicative at all, would cheat, etc.) and they realized younger girls would either be able to be convinced that it was normal or that even if they were really upset, they wouldn’t leave because they still felt lucky to be with the guy."
1411,I dont. I look very young. Im thankful I dont get catcalled but also like does this mean im ugly?
1412,"YES! When me and my friends were 13-16 we couldnt walk down the street without getting cat called by men walking past/passing in cars. Every time you left the house, you'd get harassed in some way by an older man. (Thankfully it didn't often go further than cat calling). We'd also get a lot of requests and messages of creepy, older men asking to do all sorts of things to us.


Now, I'm 24 and men dont tend to even look twice when I walk past and I have a total of 1 creep in my inbox."
1413,"Definitely. I’m in my 20’s, but I’m often told that I look 10 years younger when I’m not wearing makeup. When I get hit on in public, it’s almost always when I’m without makeup."
1414,Yes!! and I just had a daughter. She’s 8 months but I’m already freaking out about this. Sometimes when I can’t sleep my mind goes there and my anxiety goes through the roof. How am I supposed to protect my own daughter? I’m really praying things change in the next 10 or so years.
1415,Its the virgin prize. Creeps see a young girl and they only see a potential in for taking virginity. They're not think how old you are or how you feel. They're only think about themselves and how they feel. And don't tell me its not about sex. It's 100% about sex.
1416,[removed]
1417,"I don't think so, I've been getting hit on about the same amount since I was 12. Even though my body was very mature at 12 (D cup breasts) I still looked like a child. I still get hit on just as much 20 years later and I definitely don't look childlike anymore. 

Even as a teen I was told I came across as distant, so I think that helped."
1418,"I get hit on a lot more now than I did when I was younger. But then again I look 10x better than I did when I was 15-18. I was overweight and frumpy when I was younger. Now I’m in waaayyy better shape, dress better, and just all around more put together."
1419,Read some books by Sara Pascoe - she’s done excellent research into this.
1420,"I feel like I was always treated as older. 

I hit puberty at 10, and by 12 I was 5 ft 6, with C-cup boobs and people always seemed to think I was older than I was and because of that they seemed to think inappropriate comments were okay because I didn’t look like a preteen."
1421,"On the internet I get it often, I’ve never once gotten it from anyone in real life though and I’m really young. I guess it’s a case to case thing"
1422,Yes definitely. I used to get hit on starting around puberty all the way until I hit my early thirties. Then it tapered off dramatically. Really creepy....
1423,"i look old for my age. i got hit on the most from ages 11-14. i went to a lot of rock concerts and music festivals, so that may have had something to do with it"
1424,[They only want you when you're seventeen](https://youtu.be/s6jaYJx7yeI).
1425,Yeah. It's pathetic and disgusting. Mens' age radars are so damn off.
1426,"I don’t know, I have the opposite problem. I look much younger than I am and never get guys my age or older checking me out in public anymore. I do however get guys who are obviously younger than me hitting on me or looking at me which is an entirely different kind of uncomfortable. :("
1427,"I've had the same experience. I definitely was catcalled way more as a teenager, and I wasn't an especially mature looking teenager -- I was pretty awkward looking back then. As I got older and objectively better looking, I got catcalled and approached less. I think it's a power move, a way to control public spaces."
1428,"I chalked that up to ""I avoid social situations now"""
1429,Yes. I started getting catcalled at 12 as well. I also get catcalled more often when I'm underweight and look ill or more childlike.
1430,"Yep. Can confirm, am in that age range (18 rn) there were a lot more creeps when I was 12/14/17 I look a little young for my age too..."
1431,When I turned 18 it was like I suddenly became invisible. I had old creepers making comments and hitting on me until then.
1432,Easy target. Also easily discardable. A thirty year old woman can easily sell a thirty year old man on the free market. Lol
1433,"A lot of men are creepier to younger-looking and younger acting women and girls because they know that a grown woman wouldn't put up with their creepy behavior, but someone more naive is more likely to.   


This also could be anecdotal, but it seems like in the age of screenshots and metoo, creepy dudes are feeling a lot less bold when it comes to unsolicited dick pics."
1434,"
First time I have ever been catcalled was when I was 13, it became more often when I was 15-17, last time it happened I was 19. I'm 24 now, and it seems that I'm completely invisible to men, which I truly don't mind because I'm I na relationship anyway."
1435,"A girlfriend of mine said, ‘it’s not that fewer men look at you [when you’re older], it’s that *different* men look at you.’ I’m in my 40’s, and I took some comfort in that. When I’m out with my 20-something daughters, they for sure get more attention. Oh well. I have wisdom, and that shit counts!"
1436,"Yeah I think that's for a co home reasons. 1, a lot of men are attracted to younger women. 2, Younger girls are easier to trick/manipulate/take advantage of. 3, sick pervy pedos"
1437,"I’ve always looked very young for my age. I’m 30 and still have people think that I’m 15. When I was 13 I looked like I was maybe 10 or so, and I was regularly hit on by grown men. They’d honk their horns at me as I walked down the street, whistling and making kissy noises at me. There was a man that worked at a restaurant I frequented that openly professed having a thing for me and would even give me gifts. And another restaurant I went to regularly where most of the grown waiters would flirt with me and openly hit on me every single time I came in. The older I’ve gotten the less it’s happened. When I was 13 I got the most attention I’ve ever gotten in my life from grown men. And at that age I didn’t know better and just felt really flattered by it. I didn’t really understand how inappropriate it was. I was just excited that they were paying attention to me. Now looking back I’m horrified by it."
1438,"Im 25M (but this post was on the homepage)
When I was 13-18 I used to spend a lot of time with a family friend (F same age) who was beautiful and glam but not so much as to seek attention on purpose - when walking in public I was shocked how little we could walk without her receiving a suggestive or even vulgar comment thrown at her by strangers, often much older men - cars beeping at her too when walking along side a road. I always admired how she held her head up and never gave a reaction."
1439,"If I had to break it down I think it'd be:

\- 25% of these guys are looking for an easy target to impress and control. This means they do date a lot of young girls, but they wouldn't necessarily turn down someone their own age who was vulnerable enough. These guys are narcs and keep girls in relationships with them by moving very fast and making it very hard to leave without upending their whole life. ""Street smart"" is the antithesis of what makes this guy feel comfortable and in control.

\- 25% are just creeps infatuated with young girls. Nough said. These guys fetishize childhood specifically and will strictly prey on very young girls *overall*, not just anyone younger than themselves. Their manipulation is often entirely sexual, as their victims are mostly underage and aren't young enough to ""date"" or even leave their home as they please. They may use a relationship facade for the sexual manipulation, though.

\-25% are insecure and use age as a proxy for masculinity (which means they just want to date someone youngER, not necessarily young in general). These guys think their higher age enhances their masculinity when talking to someone younger, and may also see having a younger partner as a status symbol. Don't typically date actual children or young teens, but no one even close to their own age. These are your Leonardo DiCaprio and sugar daddy types.

\-25% are generally well adjusted and may actually feel a connection with you. These guys do not have a history of dating younger women and don't hit on actual teens or children. You met each other organically (work, friends, hobbies), they did not hit on you the first time you met. These age gaps are usually much smaller, but still noticeable. Relationships with this type can actually be healthy, but they can also fail due to genuinely underestimating the natural power differentials and lifestyle differences and become toxic. (The less healthy ones in this category may not actively seek out younger partners as a status symbol (they date and have dated women their own age or older), but also don't mind that aspect of dating someone younger either.)

The younger you are, the more guys in general are older than you, the more you will experience this. It doesn't stop as you age, ime, there's just less of the population to try it on you."
1440,"I mean there was a tv show (70s or 80s or something) where the host (40+ y.o) pecks a little girl (9/10? maybe) on the lips (she was visibly uncomfortable and if I remember correctly she said no when he asked at first)...with her mother standing there...infront of an audience. They found it funny.

and according to the comments, this show was known for this.

I used to think it's a generational thing (I mean most pedos are old people) but it's kind of coming back in a ""legal"" way these days (musically, tiktok, underage drag queens *barf ,* authority figures who continue to live normal lives with pedo cases on them, beauty pageants...etc)..and also there are a lot of boomer/ mellenial pedos 

and are we forgetting about Japan? the way grown women look and act, not like a younger woman, but like an actual infant (baby voices/noises, ""innocence"", the way the sneeze while doing that thing with their arms...etc)

says so much about Japanese men."

And who are all these men? They’re everywhere. Don’t be fooled... they’re our dads, brothers, uncles, close friends, coworkers, etc. guys who you’d never imagine would do something like that... those are the ones paying for sex with children"
1447,"Same! I'm also 24 and I got catcalled way more as a teenager (13-17). I would say I don't look drastically different now in terms of figure/weight, but I definitely carry myself differently (and obviously have grown out of general teenage awkwardness). 

I used to have creepy men talking to me on the bus, at bus stops - anywhere I'd be alone with nowhere to escape. Now, it doesn't really happen - I definitely have more of a confident, ""leave me alone"" vibe."

1455,"My wife has the exact same experience as you, down to being the same age and receiving the same comments and having to reply the same way. 

For her, it's random people and creepy old men on public transit thinking that she is a high schooler. Somehow it's always the topic that comes up. She's so sick of it that she often just gets up and moves to another seat to just not deal with it. And even if she has headphones on and clearly doesn't want to talk, people would tap om her shoulders to get her attention for no good reason.

There was also a time when some kids asked her, a 27 year old woman, which middle school she goes to. I think that one wasn't meant to be creepy, but she never knows why people think talking to her on public transit is appropriate."

The most disturbing experience I had was when my English teacher in my last year of middle school started calling me by my middle name ""Eliza"" and he told me that it was because I reminded him of a character in his favorite musical where the girl called Eliza falls in love with her teacher or something along those lines but it was the way he said it that creeped me out, mind you I was about 14 when that happened so I was too afraid to tell anyone of this situation."

1472,Yeah same here. I don’t think I was necessarily prettier when I was younger. And I do clearly remember being 15 and some random old dude (like 40s and 50s) would start talking to me while browsing the magazine rack or sitting at the airport. It was so gross. Now? That never happens.
1473,"Good for you. See most guys would say that you were rude because he was just asking, but it's not. You were just going about your day and somebody decided to intrude on your life.

Yeah but she was just going about a day and most women don't want guys checking them out/ asking them out when they're walking to work or going to pick up their kids from school or whatever."

Pay attention to your friends' behaviors and comments around your kids.

1496,"Ugh yes, can relate. I had an older friend who'd drive me around and buy me food, I thought I was so cool. Looking back I wonder ""what kind of 26 year old man hangs out with a 16 year old?""."
1497,"Yip, me too. I am friends with a few of the men from then and the older I get the more discomfort I feel about all the relationships I had when I was younger. I'm 29 now; started sleeping with much older men at 16 to about 23. My first older partner was 34 when we started sleeping together, next partners were in their early 40s.   


Of all my life issues, this was a 'non-issue' to me in the past, but I realise how I was exploited and groomed precisely because I was a victim of so many other issues and therefore particularly vulnerable (broken home, poverty, for a start and nowhere near the end). I was bullied at school, an outsider and depressed, and constantly praised for being ""mature beyond my years"" (which is a separate discussion - it is severely problematic to call a child this; there is something WRONG when a child shows signs of what adults mistake for ""maturity""). So naturally, when this translated into sexual attention I felt validated, special, and for the first time - beautiful. ALL of the older men lavished me with gifts, and exciting trips to hotels and different cities (remember, some weeks there was no food or electricity at home so this was a big deal). I felt that I held the power, but I could not have been more wrong.  
Hindsight is 20/20 and I'm extremely privileged to have travelled, been educated and lived in three different countries so can see with clarity for what it all is / was. I'm married to an older man (only 8 years, feels like nothing at all)."
1498,"I've noticed how this mentality is much more common in teenage boys than in teenage girls. Imo girls recognize predatory behavior against themselves better than boys. Or in other words, boys recognize it worse than girls.

During my earlier years, girls' reaction to older men making advances were universally negative, they recognize it instantly. Whereas a lot of boys who get attention from older women (it's rare but still happens) usually get the ""nice going"" or ""wow a 'milf' just hit on me, great"" if she's attractive. It's quite sad."
1499,This has been one the more terrifying realizations I’ve had to deal with as I get older.
1500,">Source: Was a 19 year old excited to date 30 year olds.

Right there with you! But I knew at 19 that was NOT a good idea. Red flags for days!! So despite being hit on CONSTANTLY since my early teens by older guys and how ""intriguing"" that might have felt - I didn't dare act on it.

Fast forward in my 30s I'm in a happy healthy long term age gap relationship with a great man. 

But anyone who is much older and dates a ""#-teen"" has some seriously warped issues. 


And then you get pedos that spew the argument of ""age of consent laws"" which is NOT intended to protect the minor. All AOC laws do is protect the pervert from going to jail bc they want to date a 16 or 17 yr old.

Excuse me while I go vomit."
1501,"I wish that had clicked with me sooner. I was also that way at 19. I was lonely and precocious and I felt really special when older men were interested in me. And just like you said: nothing special about it. These were stunted manchildren who knew their shit would not fly with women their age. They didn't treat me well. I'm just glad it happened at an age where I had enough of a clue and figured my way out of it pretty quickly, and not when I was a literal child and it probably would have had a much more serious impact on my mental health. 

If a full-grown man asks if you're ""even legal"" like he's excited about it, abort abort abort."
1502,"When I was 13, I would get grown men trying to talk to me while I was shopping for clothes with my mother. They would talk to me as soon as I was two racks away. Disgusting. 

\*yuck edit\*

I hate that this is a shared experience for most women."
1503,"It's true unfortunately. Most men are not. But there are more than people think. My mom was sexually abused by men her psychopath mother brought to her. I think my aunt said she was 8 when they first tried to start with her. Police men, boy scouts- not sure if she meant the leaders or what. This was in a small town in the US in the 60s. My mom was always thinking men were going to molest me when I was a kid and I remember thinking she was crazy. While I do think she was paranoid from her trauma, it also took me a long time to fully accept what she had gone through."
1504,"I also know people who would never be counted on any statistic because it was never officially reported. Definitely agree the numbers are probably much higher. & I even heard 1 in 4 the other day on a podcast, but when I looked up for a citation today I decided to go with RAINN's more conservative statistic.

Ugh, it's so heartbreaking."
1505,"i.e. inexperience

It's happened all my life. When I was 21 ""you must be 17""."

She's lean and fit and long blonde hair, blue eyes, generally the kid hit the genetic physical lottery. (she has dyslexia pretty hard core and maybe got my adhd - everyone has something :/ ) anyway. She's gorgeous. And I know exactly what the next 10-15 years of her life at going to hold. I wasnt as pretty as a young girl, but I was generally fit and developed breasts young. :/ She's about to enter a world that I never wished for her. Hopefully I can arm her with safe techniques and confidence to stay safe."
1508,"Yeah, it happens that early, or even earlier for some, for a lot of girls."

In my mind it’s definitely no question though. I was raped as a child, so was my mom and my sister, as children, all by different men. Then my experience as a prostitute in my teens...

1529,"I wonder if this is a generational thing? I am a high school teacher and I do think the teenagers today are more aware of age differences being problematic.

Anecdotal evidence: Studying The Crucible with 14 y/o this year, we're discussing Abigail's affair with John Proctor. Usually, Abigail is interpreted as a sort of temptress. These kids (boys and girls, with zero prompting from me) were outraged: ""What's wrong with that man?? She is an orphan, witnessed her parents murdered, tried to make an honest living and then her boss starts hitting on her? Disgusting."" 

It actually made it hard for them to be sympathetic to John's plight. They just saw him as a creepy man who hit on his 18 year old maid. They saw her as a trauamatised young woman trying to gain control of her life. I am not sure that's what Arthur Miller intended, but it sure is interesting!"
1530,"I knew multiple girls who dated illegally older boys when we were 14/15ish. 

I went to a Halloween party when I was 15 and there was this 20 yr old who hit on me all night. I was super into it. I wasnt used to guys flirting so blatantly or being so self assured (no shit, because the guys whod flirted with me previously in life were aged 12-14) But then the next day he was texting me and asking to meet up the rush had worn off and my nervousness went from 0 to 100 in an instant and I threw up and just kind of started slowly ghosting.

Like a month and a half later I found out he was dating a friend of a friend who was also 15 and sort of vaguely looked similar to me.

I hate to promote the whole ""daddy issues"" trope, but I think theres some truth there. The girl he ended up with had some serious self esteem issues and was bulimic. This wasnt the first or last time she'd date a creep because he would say he loved her and pay attention to her. that was true of eveyone I knew who dated an older boy: there was some kind of sadness or feeling of inferiority or desperation for male validation or drug use, etc.

I think saying teen girls always recognize predatory behavior is ignorant. SO MANY teen girls get impregnated by adult men. Are we just discounting them? Maybe *some* girls recognize predatory behavior (I feel like I was always guarded and distrustful of boys & their intentions in general), but certainly not all or possibly even most"

I'm not sure this is the right subreddit for this viewpoint, but I'm going to share anyways. 

I think there are guys who recognize that it's unhealthy/dangerous, but don't care. Honestly, this might be kind of gross of me to say, but I'd be 100% down to have sex with a random older woman - if the proper precautions were taken: DDF & tested, met up beforehand, etc. and it was explicitly about just the sex, which is likely *not* the case when older men are hitting on younger women. They're trying to groom young adults, and the relationship is *not* reciprocal."
1532,"I think age is less important than being in the same life stage. The life stage gap between a 14 y/o and an 18 y/o is enormous, while the life stage gap between a 30 y/o and a 40 y/o is not so noteworthy."
1533,"For what it's worth, I think your journey through this realisation is totally normal. The way this thread blew up proves it. 

So many grown women look back at the shit they tolerated (even encouraged!) as impressionable, desperate-to-be-adored girls and think ""who the hell was I?!"" 

It might feel icky, and you cringe thinking about those moments now. You wish you'd been quicker to realise, but the fact is, you figured things out eventually and grew wiser. You can't expect more from your past self than that. 

Now that girl's learning is part of your power :-)"

I’d want her to be strong and self reliant, and confident in herself. But I’d feel so scared of the creeps in the world.

She thinks strangers are people actually look evil. She doesn't get that even kids can be strangers. Despite me telling her. So me telling her I guy might try to touch her, or rape her in her own school.. She would just be paranoid the whole time she was there and shut down. (and she doesn't know what sex is or lust or any of that. She's 11 and very innocent)"
1537,"I know, I'm trying to look into special schools, because I don't think she's doing well with normal schooling anyway. It's not the schoolwork its the kids themselves. Shes an outcast because she isn't intellectually on their level. I have explained to her, not to go anywhere alone with boys, or men. If a teacher (male or female) tells her to go into a room alone with them, she needs to get someone else first. Her school has a no closed door policy, which I do like.  I've also addressed if anyone tries to touch her, she can hit them back and/or scream."

Well, after reading that I *had* to look her up! Here's the video that line is from: https://youtu.be/d2cUtdv99ig

Also, I don't know her as an actor but my googling brought up quite a few interviews. She grew up with a violent, alcoholic father. One night when she was 15, her dad came home with a gun and shot at where she and her mom were hiding, leading to her mom killing her dad in self defense. She makes a point of talking about this time of her life publically because she wants to let people in similar abusive situations know that they aren't alone, and that they have nothing to be ashamed of. I respect the hell out of that choice and strength of will."

1547,You tell those boys I am very proud of them. I graduated HS 10 years ago and my classmates were not nearly as cognizant.
1548,"I’ve noticed this. Obviously this is not all kids, but a lot more kids are more compassionate and polite these days. Zoomers and younger are more aware of being kind to other people, more aware of consent, more aware of being respectful. 

I work at a clothing store, and the teenagers and 20 somethings that come in are almost universally more pleasant and respectful. I distinctly remember a kid, probably like 13? she needed a shirt from the middle of a pile, so she carefully split the pile where her size was, pulled out her size, and put the top of the stack back where it belonged. Most adults that come in aren’t that respectful. 

I’ve also had a ton of 20 somethings apologize for asking for my help/interrupting what I’m doing. I always tell them, it’s no trouble, it’s literally what I’m here for! I just can’t follow you around and be your personal shopper (I’ve had many people in their 40s-60s try to do this) 

Anyway I’m rambling, but this has been my experience with the younger kids."
1549,"I didn't say all teen girls recognize predatory behavior, I said they recognize it better *than boys*."
1550,"I think it’s not that “girls with daddy issues” tend to go for older guys, it’s that predators deliberately target girls and women who exhibit signs of trauma, because they can often be manipulated easier (often due to wanting to make the people we care about happy)"
1551,Exactly this. 👆
1552,"My rule of thumb is how much $100 means to the person. $100 means a ton more to a 14 year old than an 18 year old; $100 means a decent bit more to an 18 year old than a 22 year old, etc.

when $100 starts meaning the same to everyone involved, that's when age gaps stop being meaningful."
1553,Same! I'm 27 and I wanna know if my baby face will go away before my grey hairs become noticeable from a distance lmao
1554,"Haha I definitely look older now but still bored of people not believing me when I tell them my age. Like, why would I lie? Maybe we'll be glad of this one day!"
1555,"That's good, you're def ahead of the curve. Way too many people teach their kids to never make a fuss and to just put up with adult bullshit."
1556,"Yeah its impressive how she became so professionally successful despite her background, when a lot of people in her same situation would not have fared as well."
1557,"If you fuck a child, you are a pedophile and child rapist. If you’re some rando on the internet who feels like they need to take time out of their day to defend these people, I have no respect for you"
1558,"Legally speaking, anyone under 18 is a child. 

I know that, when I was a teenager, my mentality was still very much that of a child’s in many ways, especially in terms of seeing adults as knowledgeable authorities with your best interests in mind. To take advantage of that mindset for sex is disgusting. 

You’re splitting hairs, and I shudder to think of why."
1559,"That's also interesting because I think it would be challenging to be in a relationship with someone whose financial situation was wildly different to my own. My partner and I come from similar backgrounds and earn about the same. We can contribute equally to our life together. A splurge is a splurge to both of us.

I know I would not feel comfortable dating someone who earned too much more than me, or had come from a lot of wealth. My ex grew up working class and my upper-middleclass background was a source of a lot of friction between us and him, and between me and his family. His mother in particular resented the fact that I have never known poverty. He ended up earning twice as much as me and would use it as an excuse for not doing any housework (though we worked the same hours). 

With a 16 y/o dating a 26 y/o, the financial inequality reinforces the power imbalance. If he has a car, a job, can buy alcohol, has his own place, etc. then she is not able to contribute equally. Then it's easy to convince the younger girl that she ""owes"" him something. This is also one factor in how financial abuse works and why so many women can't leave their partners. 

I was 20 when I made the decision never to let a man pay for me on a date. I didn't want to feel like I was obliged to be nice to him after the bill was paid and he was angling for an invite up to my apartment."

1561,"Hope so soon! And yeah if we’re going to lie, we’ll make ourselves younger, not the opposite 😅"
1562,Pedophilia is not an all-purpose insult you can fling at anyone. It's a medical/psychiatric term which specifically describes people attracted to pre-pubescent children. Period. I didn't make it up. The psychiatrists did.

1564,"I’ve been prone to UTIs since I was a kid. When I was younger I was told I couldn’t do bubble baths because they can cause UTIs. 

I’ve found that I’m okay if I take epsom salt baths. But no bubbles or bath bombs."
1565,"Yes, they do, especially if you're using bath bombs or anything like that in the water."
1566,It has never happened to me (and I take a lot of bubble baths) but if you are prone to them and still really want to have baths soak in just hot water and pass on the bombs/suds.
1567,"Wow. I wonder now too. I take a bath everyday, it is what we do in Japan. Not for too long and not always with bath salts. Everyone does the same I assumed.. I haven't gotten a UTI. I have heard bath bombs can cause UTIs though."
1568,Same here. I had to start taking showers at a very early age because of UTIs.
1569,"Your value has nothing to do with your looks. You're not failing at being a woman because of your lack of hair and makeup skills. And it's easier said than done I know but you have to stop comparing yourself to others. 

Two subs I think you should check out are r/curlyhair since you said yours is frizzy and r/instagramreality because no one is perfect in real life."
1570,"I also fail at many ""womanly"" pursuits.  But I'm a kickass loyal friend.  Ain't nothing wrong with being cute, but if I had to pick I'd take the stuff you can't see at first glance- my grit, my humor.  Girl, love yourself.  If you've forgotten how, don't hesitate to ask someone you trust to remind you you're worthy without a swipe of mascara because of what's inside."
1571,"You do have value, try not to think like that (hardest thing to do, especially when feeling crappy).

Women don't have to be good at ""girly"" things, but I recognise these feelings as I often get waves of feeling like this, too. There are a lot of societal pressures on women and how they ""should"" look. If these ""girly things"" are something you want to do, practice until you find a look you like. Make it fun - hell, make the most of quarantine and do full blown clown make up for a laugh! 

Personally, the only ""girly"" thing I do is occasionally paint my nails. I make a point of sitting down with a decent film/TV show on and then take my time filing, painting a couple of layers and waiting for them to dry properly. Less chipping that way.

I'd suggest that you potentially look into getting some counselling to help with you feeling down/not valuable. I'd also suggest listening to some good podcasts - something like the Guilty Feminist. I've found that this podcast has really helped me to feel empowered and happier in myself, especially as a woman. Plus it's hilarious!

Sorry for the waffle - it's nearly 3am here and my brain is a bit all over the place. I hope you are okay - you got this! 💖"
1572,Think about if you actually want those things. I complained for years about how frustrating hair/makeup/clothing trends only to find that those things are not of very much interest to me. Just try to look neat and clean and that should be just fine.
1573,"Do you actually want to do make-up? Or do you think you have to as part of being a woman?

Because you do not have to be able to create a flawless, Alyssa Edwards-style lewk. It’s not a requirement of being a woman."
1574,"Consider that the things you mentioned are not universal, nor have they been around throughout human history. Not every women who ever existed did their hair, makeup, nails, etc. In some countries, women aren't expected to do those, nor can they afford to (both money and time wise). Does that make them any less of a women? 

You're more than just a woman. You're a human being, and like all others, you have so much more value than meeting some beauty standards set by society (or even yourself)."
1575,"Being a woman is not about outward appearance. Who are the women you admire most? They might present themselves well visually, but I bet there's something else you admire about them too."
1576,"People have different talents and I know it is frustrating but makeup, nails, etc. all take time to master but some people pick them up easier than others.  The problem is not that you can't do these things but that you've a) equated your innate ability to your maximum potential and b) internalized these things as your connection to womanhood.  People who get really, really good at things struggle with them for much longer than other people will even try.  But don't think that because you have a harder time mastering something that it means you can't/won't/are only as good as you ever were. 

&#x200B;

Girls receive different types of compliments to boys growing up and they're more general and innate, ""you're so clever"", ""you're so pretty"" type praise while boys are given more sincere and specific praise like, ""great teamwork"", ""solid effort"", etc.  So we believe that we are either innately something, innately girly, beautiful, clever, or we are not.  Then when you add in my second point, that this is how we've internalized womanhood, as makeup and shiny hair, when we feel like we are not those things, it feels like an innate failure at womanhood.

&#x200B;

And I am here to tell you that it is not a failure at womanhood on your part, at all.  I'm not here to tell you those are stupid things to care about if they make you feel good, and if they do then don't give up!  Everything in your whole life takes practice and you can master absolutely anything with practice.  Anything.  But you're not less of a woman because you can't do liquid eyeliner.  Are you less of a woman if you can't play the piano?  Why's makeup and hair what makes a woman a woman?  Ya know?"
1577,"Doing makeup, hair, or nails, or having a nice body does not make a women. You are no less of a women because of those things. 

Do you actually want to do those things? Or is it because you feel pressured by society to?

Whether you truly do or dont is both fine. If you do, just know if the outcomes aren't what you wanted, it does not make you a failure. Just like art, it will take a lot of practice, but you will get there. Dont beat yourself up over it."
1578,"The first thing you need to address is your black and white thinking. Is it really true that ‘everyone’ has ‘perfect’ hair? Is it helpful to you, does it move you closer to your goals, to categorize them as innately perfect and you as a innate failure? 


Black and white thinking is an EXTREMELY common cognitive distortion. Consider googling about it or seeking Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Thought hygiene is crucial if you’re going to take new actions in your life. 

Because here’s the thing: sucking at something is the first step to being kinda good at something. And from there you practice a lot and find a lot of things that don’t work, and eventually you find some things that DO work. But if you can’t emotionally tolerate failure, then you’ll never reach success. 

I used to think just like you, and to be honest it kept me miserable until my 30s, when I had a nervous breakdown and had to completely rewire my brain. Is it possible you have a history of trauma and shame that makes you feel perpetually less than?"
1579,"I used to be like you, minus not leaving house because of it. So hear me out.

You can't fail at being a woman. You're failing at living up to what society brainwashes us a woman should look like. That's true for pretty much everyone 95% of the time. Even the supermodels don't look like that in real life. The whole idea is that in order to get you to buy stuff you need to feel like you're lacking something and the product will fix your problem, you can't sell to someone who doesn't feel they need anything, so that's what that is, marketing. Don't buy into it. 

I stopped caring I think by only age 30 or so, should have done it a lot sooner. 

What helped was my observation guys tend to want morning sex, like when my hair is a freaking crow's nest, I'm not wearing any make up, have a fleece pajama on and didn't even shower or brush my teeth yet. If that is attractive, then who bloody cares. I've never, ever heard a guy say, wow her nails are so pretty I want her now. The whole make up thing and all, lots and lots of guys are actually averse to it. 

I can't speak on what lesbians find attractive but the ones I know don't do makeup either lol. 

So stop wasting energy on something that doesn't actually matter imho."
1580,"Girl, if you identify as female, then you’re a female. Makeup, hair, nails, none of this matters! You have value and worth. 

If you truly want to tackle make up - remember it’s a process to a learn! Nobody is good at it right away. Hell my eyebrows are still a mystery to me. Lashes - I get them lifted and tinted. I paint my nails and immediately smudge them because I have no patience. Then I get to work and chip them. 


You are beautiful and amazing - remember that xx"
1581,"Oh my days, you sound like younger me. You’re not failing. You just have other strengths. You’re quite eloquent, and just from what you’ve shared, obviously determined, and likely a perfectionist. There’s no rule book that says you have to be perfectly done-up to be a woman. Actually, there probably is, but fuck that book. That book is trash. And as far as leaving the house goes, you are your biggest critic. People are way more wrapped up in their own worlds to actually notice, care about, and critique your makeup abilities. I realized in boot camp, that my world would not end if I did not pencil in my brows every morning, and nobody pointed and stared, either. Just do the best you can at loving yourself. The rest of it’s for the birds."
1582,"Sweetie, you have my absolute permission to punch anyone who tells you that are worth less than someone else just because you have chipped nail polish or can’t put on mascara. 

You are smart, honest, affectionate and talented and the rest of it is temporary. Come join us in the make up free world of women who can’t do their own hair but kick ass on the daily. You are so welcome."
1583,"Hey OP you are as much a woman as any other woman on this planet. You know, these ""girly"" stuff, they don't determine who we are. You don't have to act like a woman to BE a woman. You already are.

Like others asked, do you really want to do those things to acquire skills that you'd like to have ? Or do you want to do it so you will feel like more of a woman in the eyes of others ?

I'll tell you something. I'm a woman into video games. Years ago and for years I have been one of the very few girls in the gaming communities I was playing in. Yes, at school I was a weirdo for it because it was supposed to be a boys thing. Yet I am still a woman. I do things AS a woman. They don't define if I am more of a woman or not.

It is the same for all of us, for you. Your actions don't make you more or less of a woman. There is nothing you can do or not do in the world that will make you less of a woman"
1584,"Hey, that is no way to 'fail as a woman', using makeup and having perfect hair are just superficialities and I know plenty of women (including myself) that don't like it and often look like a mess. Being pretty is not my goal and I don't really think it should be anyone's goal.. 

Please know your worth: take care of yourself the way you feel suits YOU and be proud of who you are no matter what you look like."
1585,"Okay, I'm not even sure where to begin. There is no way to fail at being a woman! These ""you're not TRULY a woman until/unless..."" (and the ""you're not TRULY a man..."" too) things are all fucking fake! If there was a way to fail at being a woman, my not-shaving, not-bra-wearing, men's-cologne-buying, faded-knitted-sweaters wearing ways would probably be that. (And also my hair is a weird mess that is currently more growing outwards than downwards, but that is whatever.) These things you mentioned are only a problem if they're bothering you. Okay, possibly the nail thing could be a problem, if they're chipping so much you might have a vitamin deficency, but I'm not like, an expert on that.

If you're real worried about the hair find a good hairdresser - my mom has really soft, thin hair, and the ends always used to get thin and ""chip away"" (however you say it in English...) whenever it got long enough to brush her shoulders. She sees the hairdresser after 3 weeks usually for dyeing, and she mentioned that she'd like to grow it longer, and she recommended some professional products, and guess who has now hair that brushes her shoulder blades. But there's nothing wrong with having it in a pony tail? I did that usually when it was still long, it gets in the way, it's normal! 

You don't really need to be good at EVERYTHING makeup, I think? We're not models, and makeup is not like, for hiding your face. You just figure out a few things that you like and that work for you, and that you can be bothered to do, there are lots of different face/eye/whatever types. I only do makeup rarely, and usually it's only foundation, sometimes contour, and eyeliner and/or eyeshadow if I have the time. Find good tutorials, I think, and if you're in quarantine, now is a good time to practice :) You probably don't need to spend so much on it though, some brands you get in drugstores work perfectly fine.

Your body is trickier. It's a journey. I have acne, I'm short and stocky (imagine a female hobbit, but with small feet), I have self harm and other scars, I'm weird all over too. You can exercise, diet, build muscle, be thinner or more fat, you can get surgery nowadays. But you can't do any of this with hate. Well, I guess you *can*, but it's not going to be very effective. I'm still learning this. To love my weird hobbit-body. To love it like I would a friend - I would never dream of loving one of my friends less if they gained or lost a few pounds, or had scars, or cellulite, or if they got surgery to have pointy ears like elves, or wore contact lenses with hearts in them, or if they looked like the Phantom of the Opera in the book. It wouldn't even factor in! And I know it's really hard not to give into the narrative that if you're not thinking of yourself as ugly at any given moment, you're being vain, but that's just not true. You don't need to carry all this weight. You can just exist. 

I'm sorry this got so long, but I guess it's just an emotional subject for me. Wish I could just give you a hug though. I know how much this sucks."
1586,"You are not failing at being a woman.

You are failing at fulfilling a picture of an ""ideal woman"" constructed by society and patriarchy. 

The thing is: The rules patriarchy put in place for women are designed to be unfulfillable. It is not your fault for failing, it is normal. And it does not make us any less of a woman.   
Being human is part of being a woman, not something that we have to get rid of to finally be allowed to claim the label ""woman"". 

If you want to be a woman, you are a woman, no matter what. Your life is there for you living it happily, not for you to try and ""fix"" yourself to be allowed to even exist. You are beautiful, you are a beautiful woman and you are a beautiful human being."
1587,"You're beautiful in your own way.
You don't have to submit to these social ""standards"" in order to be a woman.
Do whatever you want, it's your body, your choice, your rules.
If you're happy without make-up, don't wear make-up.  If you're happy with make-up, wear make-up. And don't compare yourself with others. Others have skills for blending colors, maybe you have skills you're not aware of (maybe you sing nice, maybe you cook amazing food etc)."
1588,"Your value does not lie in your ability to do hair and makeup and nails. You are a person and all people have value. You are valuable for who you are. I cannot do my hair or nails well either. But I do what makes me happy and fuck the rest. If you only feel comfortable applying lipstick/gloss then rock the hell outta that lip color! If you don’t know what to do with your hair, rock that ponytail! You don’t have to do or like “girly” stuff to be womanly or have value as a woman."
1589,Have you considered getting mad instead of sad (Massive oversimplification I know!)? F the patriarchy and all that? I'd recommend the guilty feminist podcast for a much needed boost of self love.
1590,"You have value. You deserve love and respect, firstly from yourself. 

When I start to have negative self-speak like this, my therapist told me to say to myself “I am having the thought that I am not valuable bc A, B, or C. This is a thought and it’s not true.”  By identifying these as thoughts and not a universal truth we can create distance and examine it. I still struggle, especially under lock down right now, but I’ve made great strides with my self loathing. Therapy has and continues to help me, I highly recommend it.

I want you to find that distance because you deserve better. Looks and grooming don’t define you. If you want to develop skills related to that stuff you can, but you are in no way required to in order to be a woman. You definitely have skills and wonderful personal qualities that you aren’t acknowledging.

I’m rooting for you to find that self love. So are the other commenters. You can do it! You are enough, you deserve respect, love, and happiness!"
1591,"I can't say I'm good at it either, but I did go through phases where I was very into makeup, then nail polish, then wardrobe, etc. I've found that the best way to get better is practice. Practice, practice, practice. I don't buy expensive makeup or watch tutorials anymore, but that practice helped me find what worked best for my face and perfect my 5 minute routine."
1592,"Are you a woman? Then you are not ""failing at being a woman"". Please, forget about the beauty supplies and focus on whatever matters to YOU. You are unique, you have worth and who knows, you might change the world."
1593,"I think the first thing you should focus on is your perspective.

First of all - all this 'perfection' that you see online is in no way an accurate representation of reality. It's done from practice, the right angles, lighting, filters etc. But instead of basing your worth on your looks maybe consider thinking why this means so much to you? Is it how you were raised or? Because it's okay to not be good at makeup, truth is - I'm not good at it myself but the more you practice generally the more you'll improve.  


It's okay to have bad days and it's okay to know that you're not 'perfect'. Being a woman is more than just beauty. Of course, beauty enhances yourself, but it's not the sole thing you should look at."
1594,"Most importantly, none of those things have anything to do with being a woman.
Also, there is a difference between talent and skill.  Talent can help create a skill, but everything you listed is something that requires knowledge and practice.  I'm sure many who are good at makeup have some artistic talent but they still had to learn what product to use for a certain look, what brush, what level of application.  Then, they practiced.  When I learned to french braid my own hair, it took 3 Saturdays off practicing.  I literally sat in front of a mirror for hours at a time trying, brushing out, trying again, undoing the knot I just tied in my hair, trying again.  None of my talents really have anything to with hair styling so I probably had to practice longer than others did.  But that's the point.  Practice."
1595,"I used to feel the same way. That I hated being a girl cause I sucked at it. My hair does what it wants regardless of styling, it truly cannot be tamed. But I'm ok with that. I don't wear makeup cause that's just not who I am. I've tried to wear makeup but I honestly don't see a difference. So I never knew how much or how little to use. It all looks the same to me. But what ultimately made me feel better was men. The men who wear make up and look absolutely fabulous. I'm this girl who doesn't wear makeup or girly clothes but it's ok cause there are men who do. It's a balance. I don't know if I was able to convey what I mean exactly but it doesn't bother me anymore."
1596,"Reading this makes me nothing but sad. All of that does not make a woman. That’s what society told us. We are so much more. I’m 22 and I too am really bad with makeup but I won’t let it affect me. We’re not all Instagram models, and natural beauty is so much more appealing to me. Please don’t feel that way. We are all beautiful in our own unique way."
1597,"Welp, everybody’s a shut- in right now. So you have some time to do some thinking. Here’s how you stop agonizing: redefine what it means to be a woman. Instead of putting energy into counting flaws, cultivate what makes you awesome. Be kind to yourself."
1598,"So I did a deep dive into your profile (apologies), but it helped me really understand where you’re coming from because I’ve been there. And truth be told, any of the answers you get here, right as they may be, are only going to give a short lived happy feeling that’s probably just gonna make you cry and circle back to feeling worthless. But you’re not! You’re just letting your brain trick you into that feeling. There’s not a lot anyone else can say or do because it’s up to YOU to make the life changes, but I’m gonna try my best without sounding too cliche. 

First, just to reemphasize the other comments, there is no right or wrong way to be a woman. At all. As I type this, my splotchy nails are drying and I haven’t applied make up or done my hair in weeks, but I’m still flaunting a skirt. There are no rules. 

But if you want to live by those rules, it just takes a lot of patience and some practice. The amount of money you spend on make up doesn’t mean a thing, it’s the amount of time. A class or a palette do not gift you with a talent because talent isn’t an object. It’s effort and repetition and experimentation and patience and passion. Same for hair. If your hair is frizzy then yes, check out the curly girl method. You’ll be surprised with what you find! I also like to use bendy foam rollers to sleep in so it’s less work and heat damage, but even when I throw my hair up in a ponytail or bun it looks a little more interesting. (Side note: Honestly if I had to sum up womanhood in a hairstyle it would be a ponytail or bun cause it’s the get stuff done ‘do) If you’re unhappy with how you do those things but they still matter to you, then start practicing more in your spare time (and don’t give up until you’re done with your whole face because it always looks weird until every part is done and then it finally comes together). But if these things don’t make you happy or excited, there are hundreds of other ways to express your womanhood. 

Second, it’s actually really important that if hair and make up and other “girly” things don’t make you happy, then get it out of your routine. Keeping things around that only leave you with negative emotions and thoughts is what’s hurting your chance at happiness. Some things leave us feeling unsatisfied and we can improve on them, and some things leave us feeling bad and we don’t need them at all. If it does not make you happy, let it go. That’s easier said than done, but it applies to everything. Jobs, marriages, locations, hobbies, etc. Find a new one, I promise a million more exist. Life is too short to stay on a path that doesn’t make you happy, even when you’re 80.

Third, knowledge is power. Watch a million YouTube tutorials from all walks of life for hair and makeup because you never know which one tip or trick is going to be your breakthrough key to feeling successful. Watch how to give yourself a good manicure, what make up is best and how to apply it for your age group, what clothes best for your body, and so on and so forth. If you want to work cleaning peoples houses, look for videos and blogs on that because it is 2020 and ALL of that exists online. The resources are bountiful, you just gotta do the research for it. 

As someone sitting in a less dense area of the depression jungle, it’s easy for me to tell you to do those things. But I’ve been in the lowest of it and I knew I had those resources and the scary steps I needed to take yet ignored it all because “it’s not gonna work anyway”. I know it’s overwhelming and going to get pushed aside and forgotten like a bobby-pin behind a dresser. But making life changes, both big and small, are the key to feeling better. In the meantime, seek some help for this difficult journey. If therapy isn’t in your budget, try browsing some subreddits and googling psychology treatments. For an example, see if you can find some cognitive behavior therapy techniques you can work to apply yourself. Cognitive distortions are hugely eye opening to how we self sabotage, but recognizing and working to minimize that thought process can help."
1599," I dont have a lot of advice but I would suggest you base everything on how it makes you feel. I struggled with my hair for a while in middle school but I doubt anyones hair was on point back then. I have grown alot in my fashion sense and what I wear and how I get ready. I got to where I am now by trial and error, practice truly makes perfection or atleast a copy of it.
 I would  recommend you try out a lot of different styles of clothing and see what you like and what's comfortable. And start creating 'looks' with what you like. 
Hair, read up on your type of hair, figure out what  it's missing, get a mask for it and a good conditioner, hair loves moisture. Since you keep your hair back most of the time I'd say learn some braids and try a slick back bun or a ponytail. 
 Accessories will add a nice touch to anything you wear. If you don't like alot of weight or hassle then don't go near them. 
        
You can Dm me for questions. But that's what I could come up with."
1600,"I think you might need to redefine what ""being a woman"" means to you.  Society's answer is only trying to control you.

Don't worry so much about what others think.  Be who you want to be.  Find the courage and confidence to proudly be your own kind of woman!"
1601,"There is no ""failing at being a woman"" 

If you have two xx chromosomes, you *are* a woman.

Find what works for you. It may not be traditionally feminine, and that's okay! 

I am similar to you and enjoy it. I wash my hair once per week and let it air dry. It's either down or in a ponytail. I don't do my nails at all. They grow until they break off and then I clip them so they don't have any rough edges. I don't shave (anywhere). I don't pluck. I don't wear makeup. I wear simple clothing because I can't be bothered to find a style. And *I love it*. 

To be fair, I can do hair and makeup if I really want to. I just don't have that much energy or patience for it anymore. I don't have time in my life to continuously do things that cause adverse reactions or harm me. 

That being said, I have lots of ideas if you are committed to doing feminine style.

First of all, makeup takes practice. Like, doing it once a day. It's a skill, which can be learned but you aren't going to look like the makeup YouTubers out there. If all you can do is lip gloss or lipstick, then start there. As Jeremy Renner (yes you read that right!) says, focus on the lips, eyes, and brows: they frame the face.

Hair is a challenge, especially curly hair. Do you brush it? Some curly haired people swear against brushes and only use wide tooth combs. Others use the curly girl method. I knew a girl with the most amazing ringlets and she never brushed her hair... She only combed it when there were too many knots. So definitely look up methods and try one for a few months. If it doesn't work, try something else. Nothing will work right away. Oh, and definitely consider trying different shampoo or conditioner. It might make all the difference! 

Nails can be left alone, but the biggest thing is to make sure your hands look tidy. Having big fancy nails isn't everyone's jam, so you can start by doing basic maintenance. Keep your hands moisturized, clip your nails to a shape you like, file them, and make sure to take care of hangnails. If you want to have a feminine look without the stress, you can get your nails professionally done (I recommend gel polish if you are rough on your nails). 

As for dressing yourself, can you think of any outfits you liked in your past? What shape were the garments and how did they work together? What did they accentuate, and how did they accomplish it? Is there any style you really like now? Focus on accentuating things you like and minimizing what you don't. It's amazing how the cut of something can make one person look frumpy and another look great! Maybe make a list of things to try on and see if you like *even a little bit*. Let's say pants for instance. First look at the rise, there's high rise, mid rise, and low rise. Then the shape: skinny, straight, flared, boot cut. Then the length. All garments have these kinds of differences, so look at them critically and individually. If you don't like a pair of pants, is there an aspect you do like about them? Then find pants with the right combination of everything. 

Another thing to look at is what colors you like. Most people will surround themselves with certain colors. Look at the things you have around your home. What do you surround yourself with? Then find a close color that looks good with your skin. If you have tons of pattern and colors, don't be afraid to reflect this in your fashion. The goal of everyday wear is to express yourself, so do that.

Another thing: tailoring can change everything. It's amazing what well tailored clothes can do. I had cute jeans that I liked and got them tailored... And now they are jeans I absolutely love and cannot live without. 

I'm not saying to do all this in a week or less. Just chill. Learning how to dress yourself in a way that you enjoy is a lifelong process. Our tastes change, and our bodies change too. Figure it out over time. If you are comfortable with it, go to a clothing store that has a lot of everything and try different styles on. Notice what you like about each item, whether it's the cut, color, fit, shape, style, or even just some buttons. Eventually you will get a better sense of what you like and be able to spot items you love. 

Another big thing with all of this: write down your priorities in life and think about how you want to enact those or show them in how you live. 

For me, my priorities right now are saving money, being healthy, and being comfortable in my own skin as naturally as possible. I also have priorities like finding quality pieces that I can enjoy over the long term and I will eventually move to ethical clothing as well. The quality pieces and classic styles mean that they don't get tired for a while. I can wear them until they are very worn, saving money long term and providing me with consistency in my wardrobe. I spend a good chunk of change on one garment or one pair of shoes, but I keep them for 4+ years. I sew old clothes into new creations.  I still want to get weirder with my style, but I have a long time to do that yet."
1602,"You are you own definition of a women. Do what makes you feel good. You'll shine from within. 

It sounds super generic but really, if you do stuff you like and makes you feel good, it will transpire. I feel for you."
1603,Oh yes instagramreality really opened my eyes

1605,"What is her secret? Why, it's Alyssa's secret...."
1606,I wish I had talent to do make up because I don’t like being a plain Jane.... people have actually called me that to my face
1607,"This so much. Girl, you are a woman regardless. What you look like will not change that. Women come in all shapes, sizes, colour, orientation, likes, dislikes. I barely wear make up, hell I was a tomboy my whole life. I don't get my hair done fancy or get my nails done. 


I'm a woman because I love my children. I take care of all those I come across. I support people when they need it. I am a mother, I am loyal, honest, I live by my morals, and I love fiercely. That's what makes me feminine. 


In the words of India Arie...

I am not my hair, I am not this skin,
I am not your expectations no , no.
I am not my hair, I am not this skin, 
I am the soul that lives within... xoxo"
1608,Ngl the morning sex thing / any kind of normal interaction without makeup on was both a relief and a revelation for me in the confidence department too
1609,Question .. what is wrong with you?
1610,"I don't wear makeup and I never have (except for family weddings, or things like that, photos you know.) I don't plan on starting. I don't shave my legs or anything else. I can't do my nails either, or my hair. It's just not a priority. Tips that help me still feel like a girl (when I want to - don't forget, you get to decide what a woman looks like, because, that's you! But I feel you, societal pressure doesn't just go away because we want it to 😉)

1) Do you wear glasses/contacts? If you wear contacts, ditch them for glasses. They're easier and faster and provide an instant focal point/contrast for your face. If I don't have my glasses on, my face just disappears 😅.

2) If you don't do anything with your hair, *tell* your stylist when you get it cut. Tell them, ""I never use any product or have time to style my hair. I need a cut that will work with my face shape and texture and look good air dried."" They will push back and say if you just use a little bit of this...or just use this one tool...but be firm and don't let them blow it out after they cut it, and a good one who knows what they're doing will work miracles. They have to try and sell you product, it's how they make money, but if they won't make it work without, leave. And when they do, they've got a loyal customer for life.

2b) In all honesty, I just pull it up in a messy bun every day. It's off my face, which is all I care about, and still obvious long. But I've been blessed with dark blonde thick wavy/curly hair. It looks decent no matter what I do 🙃

3) I've never had a ""normal"" manicure survive longer than 12 hours, and I've even ruined them before I made it home before. The secret is DIP NAILS. They are COMPLETELY dry in less than ten minutes. Like, run your fingers through your hair, dig through purse, unbutton your jeans to pee, dry. With no UV light. And they will last *at least* two weeks. I've had them last more than a MONTH without chipping or cracking or peeling off, but never less than two weeks. Also, they're super strong and make me feel like wolverine. Cons: They're $50, and they wreck my real nails underneath, so even when I can afford it, I can't get more than 3 in a row without stopping to let my real nails grow out and recover for awhile, so I save it for special occasions, vacations, or when I just really need the boost from fancy nails. 

From one very ungirly girl to another, I hope this helps ❤️🐢"
1611,Those people sound rude!
1612,"What is ""plain"" to some is beautiful to others. There's not one size fits all with attractiveness and attraction.

And people that feel the need to make comments like this are unthinking and unkind. I've been there, it really sucks. But it's just one opinion."

1614,"This is a sub for asking for advice. She's asking for advice. Take your negative attitude elsewhere, it's not needed here"
1615,I don’t think I’m handling it very well. Any advice for those that live alone and don’t have anyone else in their lives that understand my loneliness or anxiety?
1616,"I have good days and bad days. Whatever day it is, I try to stay active doing some workouts on youtube and doing yoga and mediation. Call or FaceTime your friends and family as often as you can. And of course vent to online strangers 🙂

I think it’s important to remember we’re all going through this. It’s easy to lean on people and be a shoulder for others. Today’s a good day for me, yesterday was awful. However, there will be an end to this. It will pass."
1617,Talking on forums and playing online games are an option if you can't reach friends or don't have any
1618,"I’ve found that the days I get a little bit of exercise end up a lot better mentally. I’ll either do a 30-60 minute zoom class or YouTube video, or go on a walk outside."
1619,"Seeing people over FaceTime or Google Hangouts really helps. I've been catching up with family from other states and my work group has done a couple Zoom meetings to touch base. 

My friends have a discord we share dumb stuff and random thoughts on. My neighbors have a group text where we offer up whatever we're anxiety baking at the moment

I did that online yoga class that was on Reddit a week ago, and I think there are still ""meetings"" you can join to work out or meditate together

Hope you're doing alright!"
1620,"I hate not leaving the house. Before the virus situation, I'd always need to leave the house at least once a day, even if I had nothing to do. Staying inside made me feel useless somehow. I have bad anxiety so maybe that's why.. like I get anxious about wasting a day.

But now with this situation, well, somehow I feel less guilty about staying home because I have to obviously. I have been catching up on work, study, housework, etc. I also started guitar which is rewarding."
1621,I've been pouting a lot and working out. My tan is coming along nicely.
1622,"I read the title and thought you meant outie belly buttons.

1623,I like the bikini style undies from Aerie! They have a pretty wide crotch area and no weird seams.
1624,"I just recently discovered target has the best [underwear ](https://www.target.com/p/women-s-laser-cut-hipster-auden-153/-/A-54046799?preselect=53917449#lnk=sametab) ever. They're really similar to ones I have from Victoria's secret if not better. They're the ""no show"" ones and they're really soft and just the best. I got like 5 pairs of the black and one of the peacock design and they're so cute lol"
1625,"My roommate is also considerably large and flappy down there. But she takes the opposite approach and let her labia free, wearing mostly the tiniest (and lightest) g-strings with string-only crotch or the t-front thongs. Looks weird but she says it is the second most comfortable way to cope with her anatomy, after going commando. Only under tighter trousers she wears boxers."
1626,"I wear men's boxer briefs from Target after another woman recommended them. They're much better than the underwear or boyshorts that you get in the women's section. There are no seams down the middle. The extra space designed for a man's dingaling is perfect for us with longer labias. I've been able to successfully wear them under jeans and other pants and skirts. They're also soooo comfy (I'll just wear them around the house) inexpensive, and I never have wedgies anymore. 

I know you're going for cute so these might not be your top choice but I personally don't think they're too bad looking, just not traditional ""feminine"" cute.

Whatever you choose, good luck! Sending you good comfy underwear vibes 😂🙏🏽💗💗"
1627,I thought the same thing! I didn’t understand what an outtie belly button had to do with panties! I was imagining her wearing granny panties that go up to her waist or something!!
1628,Awesome thanks!
1629,Thank you!
1630,Oh man that sounds really painful/uncomfortable idk if I could do that 😅
1631,"Tbh as long as I can be comfy, I’m happy! Thanks for the rec!"
1632,Exactly what I thought lol
1633,Only when you want a fresh tan!
1634,Only when the tan starts wearing off and you want to redo it. Otherwise you’re just prematurely removing your tan.
1635,I would not exfoliate daily... yeesh r/skincareaddicts want to talk to you
1636,"I dont exfoliate daily, I was just wondering as I thought fake tan could increase dead skin follicles or something"
1637,"It won’t, your skin will still “die” at the same rate. It might be a bit more noticable to you because the outer skin that has been dyed by the tan is falling off and leaving the lighter skin visible. But I doubt anyone else would be able to tell."
1638,"I adopted a big, scary looking dog. He's the biggest sweety to me, very attached, and I've spent time training him well. We typically go on nighttime walks because we live in Hawai'i and it's too hot during the day. I still get comments (albeit less of them), but they're always about my dog. He's gone into protection mode at a couple appropriate times and trust me, no one wants to mess with us. He has drastically decreased my anxiety. 

Not saying this is the easiest or best solution, but it's what has worked for me."
1639,Do you have some sort of safety app like Noonlight? Because that last one gave me some real fear.
1640,"OP I'm really sorry to hear about your walk from home. Those men are creepy and their actions are just uncalled for... It's absolutely unacceptable you had to deal with that 3 times in a day. u/hanburgerhelper made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/fq0g2n/coping_with_being_creeped_on_by_men_in_public_18f/) few hours ago described her similar experience, I think you might find a lot of helpful comments from her post! It made so angry that both of you get harassed constantly."
1641,"Walking alone can be risky for men or women. Find a walking/running partner which should help. Try to vary your exercise times and schedule to make it more difficult to follow you. Don't talk to strangers; asking the time is a classic ruse. Everyone knows the time, it's on their phone. For self defense, buy a can of bear spray and keep it with you. Some are sold with holsters so you can run with it. Good for both derelicts and aggressive dogs. If you can get a dog, they can provide a level of security."
1642,"Buy a stun gun and just show them the stun gun, they are surprisingly legal in most states, but check your laws."
1643,"I have a little knife ring that I got from Amazon that is sharp, thick, serrated plastic. I wear that when I have to walk anywhere at night, in case I need to defend myself.

I also got a personal safety alarm for my keys, where you just have to pull the tab for the alarm to go off. Also, maybe get one of those rubber fitness rings and wear it on your left hand to make it look like you're married. It may cut down on harassment, but it may also give the impression that there is a man living with you as well which could discourage people from following you home."
1644,"Are you able to walk in earlier times / well lit areas?  
It sounds bad but maybe you could also equip a rape alarm just in case if any of them try anything.

Otherwise if all else fails, you can also try working out at home too. Sorry to hear you're going through this :( but your experience is one of the main reasons I've stopped exercising outside as well to be honest."
1645,"Awh, that sounds sweet! I have been wanting to get a pet for a while now, but sadly my apartment doesn't allow pets. :(   
Hopefully once I move out I can adopt this idea!"
1646,"No, and I haven't really thought of any apps like that, but that is a great good idea. Thank you!"
1647,Thank you!
1648,">Everyone knows the time, it's on their phone. 

Yeah.. That's what set off the red flag for me.. Who doesn't have a phone these days. He was a younger age as well!!

Thanks for all the advice! ♥"
1649,Interesting ideas! There are so many things I didn't know or think about! Thank you!
1650,"Yah, trying to go out earlier and come home earlier now. \^\^   
We just had time adjusted as well for more daylight time, so that should help!"
1651,"Yeah, living space is always difficult. I have PTSD and he's classified as an emotional support animal."
1652,"As long as you're safe :) and yes it has, but I know it can be a pain - but seeing as you can't get a pet at the moment this is probably one of the more safer options."
1653,"Wish I could get the same. I definitely went through a bunch in my past.. Maybe I could look it up, see if I am entitled to anything. Thanks for the idea!"
1654,Do you have a friend with a dog who needs some exercise? Maybe you could take it on runs with you.
1655,"Haha, I wish! But maybe once this virus thing is over I can maybe take on a job taking dogs on walks!"
1656,"Here are some ideas for 2 player games/activities

- ""Heads Up"" app/charades

- Online Mad Libs

- The Wikipedia game--decide on a goal subject. Both click on the Random Page button at the same time, then navigate to that goal page using only links from the article!

- Play online flash games like Soccer Heads, Tanks, Neopets games

- Read mystery short stories and try to guess the ending. You can either work together or compete!

Also it's okay to spend time apart if you guys need it--dont feel like you guys must be constantly doing things together (unless you like that of course!)

EDIT: Also virtual game nights with friends are a ton of fun to host if you do want to recreate a game night experience"
1657,"Unstable Unicorns is a fantastic little card game you can pick up at Walmart. My boyfriend and I enjoy that one, as well as the similar games Llamas Unleashed (same creator, same basic structure as Unicorns) or Exploding Kittens (different creator, but similar style/humor). They aren’t exactly drinking games, but it wouldn’t be hard to come up with some house rules. They would all be fun to play drunk. Also, have you considered strip poker, or strip scrabble?"
1658,"My boyfriend and I just made bread tonight and it was amazing and the best easiest bread recipe we've ever tried [recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-artisan-bread/)

You could do a couples yoga video on YouTube, paint or draw together. Sometimes friends or my boyfriend and I will have a sheet of paper and someone start drawing something then the other person adds to it until you have a full page. You could do a beer or wine tasting/pairing with food or snacks and or make a nice charcuterie board.

Sorry I dont have any like actual game ideas."
1659,"Thanks so much for your ideas, they’re really good! I agree that time apart is good, but we are wanting to spend time together, mainly on the weekends. We are used to socialising on the weekends and are both prone to feeling lonely easily."
1660,"Awesome ideas! I haven’t played any of those games, and I also hadn’t thought of strip games ;)"
1661,"Okay that's good, I just know that my SO and I live together and we're prioritizing time apart as well as hanging out right now. I'm glad the ideas helped :)"
1662,"I imagine it would be really important to assure you have time apart if you live together. That’s why I made sure to mentioned that we live separately, and I’ve been visiting about three days a week."
1663,"Ah I must have missed that in your post, sorry about that!"
1664,"i love ogx brand. a little expensive compared to other drugstore brands but the quality is great. their coconut curls shampoo conditioner, hair butters (basically a leave in conditioner), and their spray hair oil is a staple for me and i've repurchased multiple times!"
1665,Garnier makes a hair mask series that are available at most pharmacies or online. They’re at or under $5 a piece and I’ve had good results with all of the formulas. I’d add a deep moisturizing routine in about once a week and see if that is enough.
1666,Argan oil is really effective in small amounts on slightly damp hair. They have bottles for under $10 at Walmart and the brand doesn’t matter as long as the main ingredient is argan oil.
1667,Check out r/curlyhair!
1668,"Kerastase or Biosilk!

I used Kerastase series in the past. Shampoo+conditioner+oil serum. I heard Biosilk is also good for unruly thick hair. My friend with curly hair uses Biosilk oil serum."
1669,"I have really dry hair and have been trying out various products myself. I haven’t perfected my routine so I don’t have any product suggestions but I did want to suggest using hair wraps/bonnets/silk pillowcase. 

I began regularly wearing a bonnet to sleep for a month bc I’d wake up with so much breakage on my pillow and my dry hair would just be all sorts of nappy, frizzy, and brittle.  I got a 5 dollar bonnet at Walmart and moisturized my hair with lotions like normal before bed. I noticed a huge difference within a few days with how much more my hair was able to retain moisture."
1670,"The two suggestions I came to make are already here - Garnier Fructis 1 Minute Hair Mask & just Argan oil. Both are pretty inexpensive. I started using both & my hair has completely changed! I use the hair mask 1-2 times a week in the shower. I use about 3-4 drops of argan oil in my damp hair after every wash, from the middle down to the ends, never right on the roots/scalp. Using more than just a few drops makes my shoulder length hair look greasy. The Garnier 1 minute mask is about $5 & I buy a big 4oz bottle of organic cold pressed argan oil on Amazon for about $15; the 4oz bottle lasts for at least 6 months. I sometimes add a few drops into my body lotion or use it alone on my face when my skin is extra dry."
1671,"You don't need to be polite to strangers who aren't being polite to you. It's okay to yell, ""go away you fucking creep."" These men like the power they get from your shame. They like that you're scared to call them out. So make a scene, if you feel safe. Take a picture of the flashers and report them. Report them if they cover up too quickly."
1672,Start filming them
1673,Make a scene when it happens. A lot of these guys rely on women being conditioned to deescalate a situation rather than make a scene. Make the scene. Not only does it call out their behavior but it gives you strength/power/whatever you want to call it... it puts you in the driver seat of the situation.
1674,"Don't let them make you feel small.  They are the ones being fucking creepwads. They should be the ones that feel like every inch of the disgusting trash that they are. How dare they.

That said, I would avoid walking around those neighborhoods. It sucks and I hate saying it, but there's some places that you just can't walk around safely as a woman. I think you found one of those places. I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. I hope society changes one day."
1675,"The coolest way I ever saw someone deal with a creep taking a picture was to go up to the guy and take his picture from a bunch of different angles. She asked him for his name so she could put it on her webpage of neighborhood creepers. No idea if the page is real, but he freaked out."
1676,"I adopted a big, scary looking dog. He's the biggest sweety to me, very attached, and I've spent time training him well.

1677,"When I was a teenager I had a father who harassed me constantly. I also use to live in a city where sexual harassment was a lot worse and larger measures to protect yourself had to be taken. This meant keeping pepper spray on you or knowing some kind of self defense was highly recommended. Now I live in a different big city so the harassment issue is different. Now, I'm 30 and all I have to do is call a guy out loudly and they cut that shit right out. The take away here is:

- Having a terrible father made me more comfortable being confrontational with men on their bs 

- There are multiple ways of handling harassment. 

- Causing a scene to draw attention to a man's terrible behavior is NOT wrong. Bad behavior is bad behavior. You wouldn't stand by if someone was being mugged, don't stand by while someone is defiling your person. 

- If you feel you're in any danger, don't hesitate to keep some kind of protection on you like pepper spray. Simply keeping it on you, even if you never use it, will give you a lot of relief and potentially more comfortable speaking up."
1678,"Don't ever settle for this kind of behavior, what they do is **not** normal. Please don't think this is how things are and that you have to learn how to cope with harassment, fight it. Record it, report it, speak about it, I know is not easy and we're often afraid of facing people that make us feel insecure.

Believe me, anything helps. Talk to your parents, to your friends, to a teacher, to someone you trust, put the subject out there and create awareness, that way you'll be helping other girls too <3 Much love and thank you for putting this topic out there, you're a strong young woman 💝"
1679,"I haven’t seen anyone address your statement of saying you don’t show how this gets to you towards your friends. 

Talk to them about it. Girls and guys!  I’m betting nearly all the other women have stories like this and your guy friends might also, OR you’re helping shape their own behavior towards women. 

There is a solidarity in sisterhood. Don’t be afraid to lean on that and use the support group."
1680,"I know exactly what you mean. I'm so sorry. It sucks.

I point at them, and yell. ""You're making me uncomfortable!""

Once a guy followed me saying weird sexual stuff. I stopped, pointed at him, and yelled ""this guy in the yellow shirt is following me! I don't know him! He wont leave me alone!""

People stopped to yell at him. 

The thing about a big city, there are always witnesses.

These creepy dudes hate attention. Make sure everyone around you knows what they are doing, that you dont know them, and you feel uncomfortable. 

They want you to act like a victim, getting small. Don't. 

And if they talk to you, just repeat what they say back to them.

I once sarcastically begged a guy for his number on the subway. EVERYONE LAUGHED AT HIM.

It was fucking rad."
1681,"Start reporting flashers. That is a sex offense and it is one that very much goes unreported and no one talks about. These men will not stop without intervention which will not be provided until they are caught. Even if you know nothing about them and don't want to stare to get a good glimpse of them for a description, report it anyways. Police can increase their presence or they can question workers in the area. At the very least, a report will be open and officials will be made aware. The more people who report, the more likely the incidents will decrease or stop."
1682,"Maybe fighting back will make you feel more empowered? Take his picture. Ask what his name is so you can report him for harassment. Make sure you keep personal defense items on your person. . Call and make a report to your local police. Blast him on social media. None of these tactics may result in anything, but it’s something to do that may make you feel more empowered. Of course, be careful for your safety. Maybe I’m feeling bold enough to call out the sick behavior, you’ll learn to let it roll off you. 

One thing to remember is that these people are wanting attention. They want your negative reaction. The more you learn this, the easier it will be to ignore, or laugh at them. They are small, nobodies. And they want to feel seen and important and they are childish and gross so they only know how to get that attention inappropriately. you can’t control them or stop them from doing and saying whatever they want. You can only control your reaction and your thoughts. The truth is their obscene behavior has nothing to do with you. If it wasn’t you, it would be another woman. And is millions of other women. Your friends may feel just as uncomfortable as you do. If you stand up for yourself you may give them courage when it’s inevitably them being harassed. 

You aren’t alone, I’ve been there too."
1683,"If a man is getting in your space or making you feel unsafe, ""be rude, be loud, be weird."" In your case, I think the first two definitely apply."
1684,"NGL, I am much more relaxed in public now that I've reached the invisibility of middle age.  I'm sorry that you're stressed in this way.  

There's a dangerous balance that you have to play between asserting your rights and staying alive.  Sometimes when disembarking the train to get to my car I'd need to make people on the carriage see me fanning out keys between my knuckles.  I almost always then later notice somebody give me the space that I needed to feel safe because they wanted me to.  Most of the time there are going to be people around you who also want you to be safe.  Be confident in engaging their support and protection."
1685,Mace them. Not even kidding.
1686,"While this might not give you the answers, I find it really explains why this is so upsetting. Perhaps it will help someone.

Also, Captain Awkward has some great posts about this, don’t forget to read the comments https://captainawkward.com"
1687,All I can think of is pocket sand
1688,"I'm sorry. It's a hard thing to deal with and all the options on responses have downsides. If it helps, it does get a bit better with age. Ten years from now, you will get less unwanted attention. I don't think it ever goes fully away, but it does get better."
1689,"point, laugh?, and ask why they’re showing you their micro-penis"
1690,"You have basically 2 options: ignore it or react (ie. fight back figuratively). Both reactions have pros and cons for every individual and situation. Something that works for one person. Might not for another. Something that was great in one situation, might be unsafe in another. There’s no one way to respond.

There are lots of times when women are quiet in these moments and too terrified (or shocked) to respond (physically, verbally, mentally). Don’t feel ashamed if or when this ever happens to you. It’s a normal reaction and might be your intuition knowing what you need to stay safe in that moment. It’s ok. We’ve all been there. ❤️ You might even laugh, it’s a coping mechanism and it can function very well to save your life in some cases.

It’s ok to be unsure about fighting back, especially if you’re alone and don’t feel safe. It’s ok to question how or what to say. It’s normal to feel powerless, small or even to wonder if it was somehow your fault (FYI: it isn’t & wasn’t.)

So I came here to say this: if I am a bystanders in a situation where I’m not sure if what is happening is ok with you, I will wait for a sign. (Unless it’s blatantly illegal or dangerous).  All I need is a “no” or “please stop” or “don’t” or whatever....

And I will let my middle aged lady rage UNLEASH THE BLOODHOUNDS OF HELL on the person making you uncomfortable. I will sit beside you and pretend to be your mom or friend or aunt. I will jump at him and say I’m a cop or a mafia queen or your lawyer (depending on what I’m wearing). I will yell obscenities or call the police or just berate this man like my best friend’s horrible ex boyfriend. 

I will stand up beside you and for you. 

TL; DR - The one benefit of reacting with clear words, is that anyone near by will understand something is happening you don’t want and will be more likely to step in."
1691,"I used to  belch. My mother always said that I won't find a man if I dont act like a lady. So, I weaponized that advice. 

Just keep in mind, their behavior is not a reflection on you. Ignore them if you want. Or film them. Or flip them off and yell ""pervert!"". Or pick your nose.  You gotta find a way that feels right to you. Find the way that makes you feel empowered. Because ultimately, that's what they want. They want you to feel small and helpless. To remind you that you're weak and they're strong. 

So do whatever it takes to make yourself feel powerful. It takes the wind right out of their sails."
1692,"Sorry to hear.

As an elderly person I don't understand what you mean by creeped on.  I googled and something about lizards and crawling came up."
1693,"The srreet harassment when I moved to a major city almost made me lose my mind. I coped by starting to ride a bike places so I didn't have to walk, by joining feminist activism against street harassment, and by practicing what I would say and how I would resist in situations that I encountered over and over again. Gather strength and support from other women and never stop fighting!"
1694,"I was on exchange in the UK for awhile, I'm from Singapore, and my impression of how minorities and women were treated in public was a culture shock for me. I am really saddened by it and I am glad that I'm back in Singapore. But I can't help but feel for ladies in other countries. It really gave me a new perspective about Singapore's safety and the civility our people have. I know it's not a coping advice, but if any of you ever get the chance, Singapore is a nice place to live. It's boring, but at least it's safe."
1695,"Start screaming at them, everybody gonna hear you. I usually just run away or ignore them, but some of them love to grab by the wrist so then I start screaming bloody murder."
1696,"Making a scene tends to work in public; especially if there's a bunch of other strangers (or even friends) around. Getting loud and calling them out, specifically calling attention to their shitty behaviour like shouting ""You're taking pictures of me, I don't fucking know you, creep!"" while pointing at them, will get everyones eyes on that guy. They tend to recoil and shuffle away like the nasty little jerks they are, returning to their hideyholes when they realise they suddenly have a spotlight on them. You can still act all cool about it afterwards, but if someone makes you uncomfortable (whether wolf whistling as you pass or taking pictures of you without asking) then you're completely in your right to call them out on it. They knew the risk when they started acting creepy, so they can deal with the consequence of believing they have any right to treat you this way.

Whilst making a scene is a great way (and sometimes fun for dramatic effect), just remember that your safety comes first. Less is likely to happen if you're calling out a dirtbag in public surrounded by folk than if you're alone in a big empty park. Sometimes it's safer just to book it out of there, even if it's not the best option - You don't deserve that treatment, and they deserve to be shamed for such disrespectful, disgusting behaviour."
1697,Just tell them something disgusting
1698,"Yeah, definitely get loud. Esp if somebody is exposing himself to you, you want to call attention/get help if he decides to escalate and actually touch you. The more eyes on you, the safer you might be."
1699,"Carry a gun, or pepper spray if guns are illegal. Make an example of these people."
1700,"I don't like this answer and you probably won't either but dress in baggy androgynous clothing, no you shouldn't have to and you don't have to but it works.  Ya ladies, I fully understand what I've just said and don't agree with the idea but do agree with the practice. We can't change the asshat's behavior but we can change their ability to see us by using camouflage."
1701,"Unfortunately some men you just can’t reach. Ignore as much as possible, if you want you can pity them, and get loud quickly and early if they persist."
1702,In self defense they emphasize that your voice is your strongest weapon and defense. Create space and move while doing so if you choose to go down this route.
1703,"Completely agree with this. My dad used to say men like that think they're invisible or invincible. They're neither, and drawing attention to what they're doing is incredibly effective in showing them that."
1704,"Yessss I used to be so nice to weird creepy men then realized I dont owe them my politeness. Last week my friend (26) was at the car wash when a man approached her asking for money. He was stating at her chest and she said ""stop looking at my tits"" he then replied ""oh ur flat chested anyway blah blah"" and she sprayed the montherfucker with the car wash hose. I would so do that now, 18 yo me...maybe not"
1705,"gotta be honest that reply fucking shocked me. I can relate to OP, and this is a magic solution. Will def try it out.  


However, not so magical since it's not totally safe to stand with your phone out, could easily get stolen."
1706,"Yeah just start filming and say VERY loudly “guys. Omg EW LOOK AT THIS CREEPY ASS DUDE WHO WONT LEAVE ME ALONE” even if theoretically you’re not posting it anywhere, might be enough to get them to stop?"
1707,"I would be careful about this one. As much as I love the idea of shaming weirdos on the internet, it might escalate the situation or turn violent as a result."
1708,Yeah they would just like the attention.
1709,I'd be really anxious about being assaulted if doing this.
1710,"I always taught my daughters that if they were ever flashed (they took subway to middle school, so a very real possibility) to point and laugh. The exact opposite reaction the flasher was looking for.  Never flashed (that I know of) but a group of middle school girls were low-key harassed/messed with by a homeless dude.  My daughter finally told him to f off.  The other parents met with school admin, wanted more school employees on trains.  I just told them they needed to teach their daughters to say ""f off"".  I was not popular."
1711,"Um, that seems like an easy way for a guy with anger problems to assault someone."
1712,"but I heard that sometimes males like the humiliation? 



I guess it depends on the male but it's impossible to tell."
1713,And if it doesn’t work you still have a dog! Which is usually a plus
1714,"Being creeped on means that a person is the victim of an unsettling behavior from another. It’s almost always used in the context of being sexually harassed.

As an aside, using Urban Dictionary is most helpful when looking for these kinds of definitions. UD will often be one of the first sources that come up if you google slang words or phrases."
1715,"Unless you plan to train like a combat professional with a firearm, don't carry one. If you do not train frequently and rigorously on how to safely and effectively deploy and use a firearm (not to mention having up-to-date knowledge on the legality of owning/carrying/using one in your area), carrying one into a potentially violent situation means that there is **definitely** a deadly weapon present. That it starts out in your possession just means that you're the one responsible for it being there when it is used.

Your brain is your best weapon. Don't leave it at home."
1716,I dressed in baggy clothes my entire teenage years and I was still creeped on by men
1717,"Ignoring this kind of behavior is what has gotten us where we are today, where random people can make sexual threats against people in public places with no fear of admonition or reprisal."
1718,Or the person gets mad and assaults you.
1719,"Or more subtly, a video call to a friend that pans the area subtly, pointing out 'wow look how empty this space is'.  Or even obliviously pretending that you're joking about making a selfie movie about your day that gets them in shot."
1720,"I agree, but I interpret it more as being for evidence. It might make them stop if they know they're being filmed for evidence"
1721,From the cops?
1722,Too bad many pervs get off on being humiliated.
1723,There SHOULD be more structural changes (like more officers/safety measues) so that the onus is not on a girl to stop herself from being harassed. Because that just means someone else's daughter is going to be harassed.
1724,"I laughed at some guy sending me an unsolicitied dickpic, and he was so offended he turned rather nasty. (He was an aquaintance ish). But it felt kinda nice to make him so pissed off too."
1725,"Well like anything in life you need to assess the situation. The vast, vast majority of guys aren’t going to assault you though and you don’t want to live your life based on fear. It’s a sad, miserable, defeatist way to live."
1726,In a public place? Not likely.
1727,And who is to say the person won’t assault you if you *dont* make a scene? It’s easier to get away with something if your victim doesn’t put up a fight.
1728,Could you please nominate an alternative way to deal with this situation that doesn't rely on the guy realising the error of his ways without any external input
1729,Thanks. Sorry that happened.
1730,Guess you’re right. I think pepper spray would still be viable though
1731,Never said it would stop all but in my experience it cuts down the number dramatically.
1732,"They are way stronger than us, and any attention only encourages them. Agreed it’s totally wrong, I’m just being realistic."
1733,HAPPY CAKE DAAAAYYY
1734,Yes the on call police that are around every corner and never dismiss complaints as frivolous?
1735,Good job!  You are under no obligation to be polite to someone who was rude to you.
1736,"A lot of women do live in fear of men and don't have control of that due past trauma or other circumstances and calling it a sad, miserable, defeatist way to live is harsh and pretty victim-blamey."
1737,"""the vast majority of guys wont assault you""

so youre saying the risk still exists right?"
1738,"Stronger? People who catcall a solitary woman from the safety of a group or a moving car? People who creep on women and take their pictures without consent? That's not the kind of behavior that screams out ""strength"" to me. That just reeks of cowardice.

They also don't really like the kind of attention that comes from calling police dispatch, identifying yourself, describing the person taking your picture, and asking for an officer to be dispatched because you feel threatened that the person may follow you while explaining that you're going to stay in a public place and keep filming until the officer arrives for your own safety.

As for being realistic, it wasn't realistic for women to expect to be able to vote. It was not realistic to imagine a gay person would be able to openly walk down a public street. It wasn't realistic to think a black man could be President of the U.S. People who do the realistic thing do not change the world. They accept their subjugation, and by accepting, cooperate with it."
1739,Thanks!
1740,"I took a picture of a creepy dude once, put it on Instagram, tagged the police, and wrote in the caption what street corner he was standing on, that he was harassing women and saying disgusting things. The police immediately followed my account and liked the image."
1741,"That’s exactly what it is though. Whether you like that or not, calling it what it is isn’t victim blaming. A lot of women live in fear because they won’t take control to change that. I understand abusive situations, but you have choices. And the attitude you approach life with is 100% one of them."
1742,"You risk your life every time you get into a car, does that stop you from ever entering one? There’s risk in just existing friend."
1743,My personal favorite is guys who catcall from within a group WHILE in a moving car. They’re the strongest and bravest if you ask me
1744,Totally. Just not comfortable advising a teenager she should behave aggressively toward strange men who are already stepping over the line.
1745,I live by the idea that that only thing you truly have control over in this life is how you react to things so I get what you're saying but I still also believe there are a lot of women out there that truly don't have the choice to make the changes about how men control the fear in their lives.
1746,"i have to enter cars to get to and from work and other responsibilities 

i dont have to confront men who could assault me to live my day to day life 

its about weighing the pros and cons. the pro of making him feel bad isnt worth the con of being attacked"
1747,"Yeah, I don’t disagree that there are women that are in situations where they *feel* they can’t do anything about the fear and that that fear is paralyzing. But I am of the belief that just because you feel that way it doesn’t negate that you still have a choice, you’re just too afraid to act on it. I do want to say that I don’t think either of us is right or wrong here, it’s just a difference of opinion. I totally get where you’re coming from, I just don’t 100% subscribe to that belief."
1748,That’s your choice. I can tell you that I’m a 5’2” woman from Baltimore and I’ve confronted my fair share of guys/druggies and every single one of them backs down. Most of them are cowards who are only doing it because they see you as an easy mark who won’t push back. 99.9% of people don’t want actual confrontation.
1749,"thats good for you and im glad it makes you feel powerful but ive had men who have screamed at me in public over minor problems and i dont like being berated by grown men anymore then i have to let alone the risk theyd do more than yell at me. god forbid one day i find that man who does want actual confrontation. would all those other times being powerful worth having the shit beat out of me once? its not for me, but to each their own"
1750,"I understand where you’re coming from but you also need to understand that you just accepting people treating you like that by not pushing back invites that treatment on you from others who seek to take advantage. Love yourself enough not to accept that kind of treatment. Don’t let it make you meek, let it make you angry enough to fuel a fire that rains down hell and fury for the god damn audacity they had in even thinking they could treat you like that. I mean that with the utmost sincerity and love and wish you well on whatever path you take in life."
1751,"thank you so much, that was actually nice. but as a domestic abuse victim its not worth the risk to me to be assaulted again"
1752,I do it to myself with a brow razor after I shower. I apply my normal moisturizer after
1753,I use a brow razor. I use a layer of my cleanser (cerave moisturizing) as kind of a barrier. Moisturize normally after.
1754,Same!
1755,"I've read that it's very normal, your body needs time to get back to it's own hormonal cycle and stuff.

That beeing said this is only what I remember from researching the topic maybe 2 years ago.
You might want to google a bit if you want more reassurance, good luck!"
1756,"You're stressed and overthinking about this will make you more stressed. You took the test, you already had your period after the risky event, etc. You're not pregnant.


This is a really stressful time for everyone. It makes sense you'd be stressed."
1757,[deleted]
1758,"Just echoing everyone else, you're probably just stressed. I had extremely regular periods for most of my life - always 29 days exactly, and was never late once. Until one time, I was super stressed, and my cycle was 45 days!! It definitely happens, even to the super-regular folks."
1759,This must have been really stressful. I hope you're doing better now.
1760,"Have you talked to your sister about this? There's a high chance that doesn't even want to talk to him, let alone reconnect. And i would understand if so, he's racist."
1761,"You are still young and developing your hips might still get wider.
As someone who is 25 and also an inverted triangle I had to learn the hard way that you can't change hip size, they're bones, it's genetics. What is possible however is to workout, get bigger thighs/leg size so it makes you look more hourglass shaped."
1762,"You're still really young, your body is burning a lot more energy for you than it is for adults who are fully developed. My weight redistributed around 23, and now I have much rounder shape than ever before. I believe a change in figure will come in time, but you can try toning your muscles to give your lower half a fitter shape. As for your period, your just a late bloomer, and that's perfectly fine! My best friend in high school didn't get her period until 15. Just eat well, and try not to stress yourself about this too much; love your body and it will love you back! But start carrying a spare pair of undergarments just in case."
1763,"14 and still developing, try and be patient.

Also, practice loving yourself now and the things you like best, bc strong self confidence is way more important to have than wide hips.

🤗"
1764,Thank you!
1765,Okay. Thanks for advice!
1766,I will! Thank you!
1767,Never knew this was a thing... reasons why I need to look at this subreddit more. They really don’t tell you these things.
1768,"Holy shit, I didn't know that was a thing. Tbh, if I had a choice between agonizing cramps and bleeding for days, vs a series of more intense cramps and a sudden plop, I'd choose the latter 😂. I wonder if it means your period will be over soon?"
1769,"Whoa....have never heard of this before. I would be TOTALLY freaked out if that happened to me and I didn't know what it was. 

Honestly I'd probably be freaked out regardless cause whoa"
1770,"You know, the first time I learned about them, I realized that I would rather pass one of these and be in intense pain for a little while than have my period drag over a few days. I really wish I could induce this lmao"
1771,"Relieved that I’ll know what it is if it ever happens to me. And yeah...nobody tells us this stuff, so thank you for telling us!"
1772,Honestly I'd rather have this in one day than my current 6 days of heck. Lol.
1773,"I had went through the same thing one or two cycle after getting my IUD inserted. I was soooooo glad I knew what it was before hand. It made the whole experience really interesting rather than frightening. 

If only I could of had that happen for each cycle for the initial 6 months after insertion, it would have saved me soooooo much pain. It's all gone now, but damn..."
1774,"This happened to me once. The tissue was huge and I was on the toilet crying from the intense cramps it gave me before it passed. I was so freaked out that I called my OBGYN and scheduled an appointment.


 I fished the grayish red blob out of the toilet and put it in a Ziploc. When I brought it to the dr to test what it was and it came back from the lab as ""normal"" as in it was just a huge chunk of lining and not a miscarriage. Really nasty stuff! 


My early miscarriage was quite different as it was really thick clots and had a kind of bad odor to it. Still if you pass a lot of tissue you can get it tested by your doctor if you want to."
1775,"Right?? Sure, it’s very rare, but it’s scary enough that I’d hope it would get covered in general sexual health education so people don’t flip when it happens."
1776,"I sure hope so! That would be VERY nice. This whole period has been very weird. Happened randomly halfway though a pack of bc pills after skipping my last period (I do this normally), and I’m chalking it up to extreme corona stress combined with some sexual activity after about a week and a half of none, since that has triggered it before. I thought the  spotting would stop if I kept taking pills, but nope! The other night I had some weird ovary pain that I’ve never had before, so hopefully it isn’t an actual ectopic pregnancy... 

Every time my period get irregular it’s due to stress and anxiety and every time I’m like *surprised pikachu face* “but my periods are ALWAYS regular” lmao"
1777,It was freaky regardless! But also a little fascinating since I knew what it was... but yeah no I was glad I had the info beforehand.
1778,"I'm in NZ, but I pay the extra shipping to get Aerie from the states. Everything is so soft, comfortable, and doesn't shrink. My favorites are the real soft jogger, long sleeved ribbed henley, cocoon cardigan, and eyelash plunge bralette."
1779,"Omg, thank you so much!! I just looked at the website and I wanna buy everything! It all looks so comfy. Kinda wish the cocoon cardigan had a zipper though...

Btw, I'm in NZ too. Do you have to pay custom fees too or just extra shipping?"
1780,"I keep my orders to about $200 USD and have never been hit by customs. The $35 shipping is great because it only takes 2-3 days to get here (when we're not on lockdown).

Just a tip: if you're browsing on your phone you can read all of the reviews, however if you're on a computer they hide the reviews for us in NZ for some reason. Definitely read the reviews for sizing as some items are meant to be oversized and others not. I actually have most items in both small and large depending on if I feel sexy or fat that day, lol."
1781,Thanks for the advice! I will check on my phone for reviews.
1782,Absolutely love aerie and can totally recommend them! I would just put a small note about my experiences about sizing with them though. I am pretty tiny and their XS in bottoms is too small for me. Fine for tops esp if they’re meant to be big like sweaters. So just be aware and measure yourself if you can!!! I got a bunch of aerie stuff for Xmas and I’m so thankful now lol. I haven’t put regular clothes on in like two weeks
1783,"Damn, you guys have convinced me!"
1784,Done. Arriving Sunday. I couldn't see your address either. Good luck.
1785,"Please don't give your address to someone on the internet! Although the majority of people here have beautiful intentions, you never know! Is it possible for you to say you need period supplies and pop our to grab a test instead?"
1786,Hope you're okay and will get a negative
1787,"Please be careful, you are so young.. when doing unprotected sex and if you dont want a baby take a pill of the next day. Remember unprotected sex its not just pregnancy that can happen but diseases too.."

1789,thank you so so so much. i'm literally shaking right now. i promise you i will pay you back. thank you again 😭😭😭💛💛💛💛💛💛
1790,"Thank you for helping OP, that was very kind of you"
1791,"Very nice of you, thank you for helping!"
1792,we are being quarantined right now and he made me stock up on supplies for the next couple of periods 😭 he was one of the people who got months worth of everything just in case so i'm out of luck with that :(
1793,yes omg i will message you!
1794,"Pay me back by being diligent from here on out. :)

It's so not worth it to go without a condom. Any guy who is worth you will happily wear one. If he won't, he's not a good guy."
1795,"Do you have a female neighbor you could “check on” that has kids? Someone you might be able to ask if they have a pregnancy test and they *wouldn’t* tell your dad? Or can you not see a neighbor right now bc of quarantine? 

Do you have a friend who drives and could bring you one and leave it on the porch? Or even mail it to you disguised as a gift? Like put it in a stuffed animal or something?"
1796,"i know. i feel like this was karma for me being an idiot :( thank you again though honestly. i def will never ever let this happen again, especially because this has been way too scary lol"
1797,I'd add teachers to this list of people to ask.
1798,Girl we’ve all been there! It happens but we know better now
1799,Good idea. If I were a teacher and got that message from a student I’d deliver it even in quarantine.
1800,No suggestions but just want to tell you hour hair is beautiful I love it 😍
1801,Maybe half shaved? Or all around short with curls pushed forward on top.
1802,"Omg gorgeous. Short bobs are in style, really cool and low maintenance [https://www.google.com/search?q=short+bob+blonde&client=firefox-b-d&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwicpYKKp7voAhUXIrkGHZ6UBWUQ\_AUoAXoECAsQAw&biw=1440&bih=826#imgrc=v-tJLj3fzgYEHM](https://www.google.com/search?q=short+bob+blonde&client=firefox-b-d&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwicpYKKp7voAhUXIrkGHZ6UBWUQ_AUoAXoECAsQAw&biw=1440&bih=826#imgrc=v-tJLj3fzgYEHM)"
1803,You're so pretty! What if you did like curly bangs and a lob? I think that would look super cute on you and suit you well.
1804,You are so sweet. Thank you for going out of your way to say such kind words. ❤️
1805,That’s definitely adventurous! A possibility. ☺️
1806,Thank you so much. I love it! Definitely a possibility!🥰
1807,Thank you! I absolutely think a lob is in my near future! Thank you so much. ❤️
1808,"Do NOT use feminine hygiene washes!  The balance of the flora inside your vagina is delicate, just use water.  You can use soap on the exterior (labia lips for example).  I have a spray showerhead, and find a quick spray with warm water, always makes me feel clean, or a soak in the bath, but NO products except soap."
1809,"i used veer for the first time recently, and i really enjoyed it! it left me super smooth, was really easy to apply, and didn’t result in any odor or discomfort afterwards. 10/10 would recommend lol"
1810,"Just exfoliate, wash and moisturize your skin down there  regularly and everything will be fine."
1811,What is veer?
1812,"aah, autocorrect! it’s veet (not veer), a hair removal cream. works in sensitive areas really effectively."
1813,"Ah okay, I should have guessed.

I've never used depilatory creams, my big sister used them as a teenager and it left this horrible chemical stink in our bathroom and that completely put me off them. 

Has that changed at all?"
1814,"my mom had the same warning, but they must have improved the formula, it’s not that bad at all. it’s definitely distinctively scented, but not horrible and it fades/washes away easily."
1815,How long do the results last?
1816,"a couple of days, and then the regrowth after that is pretty slow too"
1817,"I don't really look for ""role models"" or expect perfect paragons of virtue to look up to.  Instead I pick qualities I see in other people, habits and behaviors that I think are worth cultivating in myself. 

There was a woman I worked on committees with for a few years, and I admired how she worked very hard to be fair and balanced, and patient.  She took on a lot of responsibility, and therefore there were times when she had to put up with people blaming her and being crappy because they couldn't see the ""big picture"", only how something might affect or irritate them personally.  I knew her well enough to see how some of this affected her on a personal level, but that she would still manage to be professional, and think hard on how to best respond to pettiness before she spoke or released any public statements.   

I did lose some respect for her after she treated me poorly in one particular situation, she shrugged it off,  so I wound down my involvement.  She reached out to me recently mentioning how the committee missed having my skills, and invited me to come back.  It might of been sincere, but I saw it as casting a net for more worker bees, and declined.   THANKFUL for what I learned, but not interested in continuing to work there."
1818,"All my role models are fictional characters that I kind of relate to but they have certain aspects about them that I try to work on myself.
For example two of my favorite characters are esmerelda from the hunchback of Notre dame and morticia Adams from Addams family. Esmerelda because despite everything she’s been through she asks for nothing but to help her people, I like morticia because she is dark and gothic which I hope I can be one day and also letting people be themselves."
1819,"I like your perspective on seeing the good side of a person and learning those qualities yourself. It's definitely not possible to find a perfect person, as there's both positives and negatives in everyone. Thanks for sharing!"

1821,File for unemployment asap.
1822,"File for unemployment, I would also call any creditors and ask what they have available for the pandemic.  Some, but not all will work with you.  Check your health insurance and see if you need to make payments or if you should switch to a Medicare/Medicaid plan.  If you can ,work on your resume, many institutions are offering many online classes for free right now.   Start planning all your meals to try and minimize waste and maximize value. Also try to  redo your budget and see where you will be and try to plan accordingly"
1823,"Where in the world are you? If this is due to the covid situation there are measures in place. In the uk you can apply for universal credit. In the us I believe it's called income support. There is a lot of information on government websites. One of the easiest ways to get advice is to speak to the citizens advice bureau. They have been dealing with this for a while now. 

I lost my job in the uk due to the virus two weeks ago. I am currently receiving financial support while I look for a few job. Good luck, you're not alone, there are loads of us."
1824,Could I still apply even if I am still employed? They are just not paying me until this is over.
1825,I'm in the U.S
1826,"Yes, when your job doesn't cut you loose but reduces or eliminates your hours it's called ""constructive dismissal"" -- and a reduction in hours means you're eligible for unemployment."
1827,"yes! idk if you’re in the us, but when i filed (in a similar situation) there was an option for covid related unemployment"
1828,I filed and used that option. I'm hoping it kicks in pretty soon 🤞🏻

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/9xb11g/when_looking_at_used_cars_what_are_some_red_flags/) thread from r/askmen and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/bez5ll/so_im_getting_my_first_car_soon_and_i_have_to/) thread from r/internetparents are excellent sources to git gud at cars. They are both asked by OPs looking to purchase a car, not people who have one already, but I still think the information to be found in both threads is incredibly useful.

additionally, the YouTube channel [ChrisFix](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCes1EvRjcKU4sY_UEavndBw) is great!  My father's the type to just disregard instruction manuals and dive straight into repairs, but I got even him to concede that ChrisFix is a good source."
1831,"Know that just because you have a relationship with a mechanic, does not mean they won't take advantage of you. I work at a dealership, I've seen people use that to their advantage.

Ask questions when they are recommending something. Does their answer logically make sense? Ask to see photos or videos the problem before authorizing repairs. I work at a dealership so we can pull more data from a car than smaller shops. We've seen a lot of small shops do repairs where they just pull the error code(tells you what component has  a problem) and replace components based on that, but not find out what CAUSED THE ERROR CODE/PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. That is def something to watch out for if you are working with a shop you do not know.

Also, ask the mechanic questions about how cars work. If I have time, I love explaining things to customers, makes my job easier down the line. Also, just look up how cars work. Most mechanical parts of cars are similar. Although new cars have a lot of electronic/computer components in them.

Yes, sometimes your car has no problems and a month later 5 different things are wrong. Especially if it is an older car. 

READ THE MANUAL!!! Follow manufacturer guidelines for maintenance, that is the MINIMUM needed for the car. You can do more if you like. Maintenance schedule is not a suggestion, it is mandatory or your car will die earlier than you like. 

You brakes and tires will wear out depending on how you drive. Average in my area can range from 10k to 50k for brakes and tires. Yes, there is that big of a range.(shitty roads, and shitty traffic).

Please be gentle with your car. Hard acceleration and braking will cause long term wear on your suspension and you'll end up paying more for repairs.

Cars are not mysterious or hard to understand, there are a lot of online research explaining how things work. However, don't fall down the forum rabbit hole and get a diagnostic online."
1832,"Purchase a Haynes manual from your nearest auto parts store for the make/model of your vehicle. It gives you detailed directions on how to perform maintenance and repairs, as well as maintenance schedules etc.

I learned about cars by fixing my own car & asking my gearhead friends to explain cars to me. I'm also mechanically inclined in general. I guess if I was starting from square one, I would search YouTube for educational videos."
1833,I suggest calling the pharmacy and making sure only you can pick up this prescription. It would be a hippa violation if they did.
1834,"Unless you have it set up so that others can pick up your prescriptions, the pharmacist can’t let someone else pick it up due to violations to hipaa.

Maybe you can tell your ma that she simply can’t pick it up as the patient herself needs to pick it up w id and all."
1835,"All clear!! Thanks for the advice!! I called the pharmacy before she went, they told me that info about my other prescriptions are not shared between the different locations of that pharmacy, so they didnt even have that prescription on file at that location! 👍🏼👍🏼"

1839,"Thank you. So I’m not crazy. I have this exact same problem with my bf. It’s extremely time-consuming and draining to ask him to do things to help out, when the tasks are glaringly obvious or I’ve asked him to do the task a week before and something similar pops up again. I’ve felt like the bad person because he isn’t intentionally trying not to help out, he’s just somewhat oblivious (?).

I hate to remind him to clean and pick up after himself because I do it so often. 

For instance, I asked him to take over trash duty every week to split up our chores, and it’s just taking out the trash and taking it to the curbside once a week. I have to remind him every week to take it out to the curb or even take out the trash from the kitchen when it’s full or stinking up the kitchen. Am I expected to ask him every time it fills up to take it outside when I reminded him for a few weeks? Do I have to spell out chores of the day as if we’re back to elementary school? 😬

Simple example. When there isn’t clean towels in the kitchen and there’s a huge load of laundry because I’ve been swamped w deadlines at work and have a million other things going on, please help out by doing a load. You obviously notice the inconvenience of not having towels. Instead, he’ll just use paper towels and if that runs out, I assume he’ll just air dry hands lol. The last thing he’ll do is laundry until I ask. Just a simple example of other glaringly obvious tasks that needs to be done

Phew, I just had to vent. I never post anything about our relationship or complain to friends because I hate airing our dirty laundry and I don’t think my friends would really understand, but I get so frustrated with all this. We don’t have any other issues except for this, but we’re both trying to meet in between where I supposed I’m more patient and he is more attentive. Not fully there yet lol"
1840,"Honestly I just refuse to do half of these things. If he gets in trouble with his family because he didn't get them a gift thats his problem. 

My husband and I split up the chores so he cleans the house every Sunday and I do all the shopping. They are suddenly very capable when you aren't doing things for them."
1841,"[An article about this](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/she-divorced-me-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink_b_9055288), written from a man's perspective that I've liked."
1842,"This begins at such a young age. My mom always gives my older brother a pass for not doing basic 'human' things, like reaching out to us once a month. She would always do his laundry until he was ~25, clean up after him, cook for him, would be (still is) extremely passive aggressive about anything and everything. She'd expect me to do things for him and volunteer my time to accommodate him. And when I told her that she was enabling him, she said ""But he doesn't know any better"" ""He is who he is"" ""He doesn't think that way."" I grew very resentful of this behavior, and in the long run, it has positively affected me to steer clear of manchildren that ask/get their mom to do everything for them. I don't want to contribute to this continuous enabling behavior. The most attractive traits of a man are self-reliance and conviction, and respect for their partner."
1843,"I am a project manager. I get paid to tell people what to do 8+ hours a day. If I'll ever have a man want me to tell him what to do during the other 8 awake hours of the day, he better match my companies pay grade."
1844,"Fucking this! I don’t *want* to have to tell you what to do, why can’t you tell when something has to be done and just...do it yourself? Why do *I* have to do it? You live here too, you’re telling me you can’t see when a chore needs doing?

I love my husband, and he works so hard for us, and I see him trying to work on improving, so I try not to get too upset, but I just don’t understand why everything has to default to me. Why doesn’t he feel guilty or like he’s a shitty partner? Maybe he does but he hasn’t said so? Why is this okay?"
1845,"EMOTIONAL LABOR!!

It is what ruined my 12yr relationnship/marriage. I took on too much, and my ex didn't do enough nor THINK to do enough. I tried every way imaginable to cope with this - but there is no coping. There is no way to win unless you move on.

I've shared this article on reddit a million times over, and I've passed it on to other men in my life and also to the stressed out overworked women in \*their\* lives.

[https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)

&#x200B;

The crazy thing is that all people HAVE the ability to take on emotional labor - they do it when they are first courting you. Notice how damn attentive they are THEN! And in my marriage we had a few years where we dated other people and I would see FIRST HAND how attentive he was to his GFs. Our living areas were kept tidy, dishes were washed, he even would make them breakfast in bed!! (WHAT!? WHO IS THIS GUY!?) But when it came to me, psshhh I had to nag him to pay bills on time. or constantly remind him of dates, deadlines and dirty dishes.

It's EXHAUSTING and unfair resulting in me becoming RESENTFUL AF . I told him many times over ""When I married you I never agreed that I would be adopting a child who's 6 months older than me.""

&#x200B;

Childfree me wants no kids and certainly no man-babies.

&#x200B;

Fast forward I've spent the past 5&1/2 yrs with a man 30 years my senior who's ex gf behaved like my ex  husband behaved. Age was never an issue for us and it's so damn nice to be with a MAN who not only takes care of his own - but is considerate in every way imaginable to look out for me too. Best partnership I ever experienced, hands down. We are balanced and it feels GREAT to experience this joy with him. It's the easiest relationship either of us have ever had. WHAT A RELIEF!

&#x200B;

My advice to all the overworked men & women in unbalanced relationships...read that article and assess if this relationship is right for you. Decide what you are willing and unwilling to tolerate. And if you feel resentful on a regular basis and there is no change in sight - it's time to move on. Don't take on more than you are willing to handle. A partnership is exactly that - a \*\*partner\*\*ship. You each need to bring enough to the table to balance your world in a way that works for BOTH of you."
1846,"Maybe because of how I was raised...or how my mother reacted to how she was raised, I am not good at emotional/mental labor. I have never, ever been good at the ""little things"" (quotations because I know the little things add up to become fucking massive). And people think I'm a lazy fuck for it. No one ever rips on my SO for forgetting an event, but I am literally the worst human being because I did. No one says it in such...forceful words, but backhanded comments and looks say a lot. My SO always says his family isn't judging me, but they so are. When they sit at a table and thank all the women for bringing snacks and then glance at me with disdain because I didn't....yeah, they're saying a lot.

I have a lot on my mind constantly. I have my own shit to deal with. I wish I was better at remembering all the birthdays and cookie preferences, but I just can't. And I don't have the time or energy to try and make myself be like that. So...I will just continue being that pseudo-woman to them. It's especially bad when paired with the fact I am never having kids. Worst daughter-in-law ever!!"
1847,"Meal planning and cooking. 
Laundry. 

These are huge imbalances for most women I know."
1848,"Adding to this: monitoring the family's emotional and physical well-being.

And speaking of ""making arrangements for date night,"" tonight is a lesser anniversary for us, but one we always celebrate. I'm finding it hard to think of things to do inside that aren't too mundane (e.g. we watch a movie almost every night now) or too much labor for me (e.g. cooking a nice dinner and cleaning up, we are in constant cleaning mode now and the idea of cleaning up after making a big meal doesn't excite me and I'm sure my husband feels the same). I need to work, but I keep thinking about it. Help me with the mental load! ;)"
1849,"My ex husband took on zero mental load. Notice the ex thing. I eventually got so stressed out that I couldn't bring myself to love him any more. This was one of many issues, but it was a big one.

My husband now does things without asking, and if he sees me doing something that is his job he'll stop me and take over. It's such a night and day difference, I can't believe I put up with less for so long! He takes out the trash, does all his own laundry, takes care of the cat box, does all the dishes, (all this without being asked) and any time he sees me cleaning he asks what he can do to help. He doesn't leave little messes behind for me to clean up either."
1850,"For me it's meals. If I'm going to doing the grocery shopping I want to know what to get! And I don't want to have to decide what we eat all the time. I'll cook it, but for some reason deciding meals on top of that is too taxing."
1851,"I think the solution to this problem is delegating at a higher level - like, instead of asking them, ""Do this Single Thing"", it should be more, ""You're in Charge of This Thing, from now on"". 

This is delegating both the actual work, _and_ the mental load associated with it, without effectively asking your partner to read your mind when everyone is in charge of everything."
1852,"wow. this... spoke volumes. i’m newly married, but had lived with my husband for about 2 years prior. when we first moved in together, i didn’t realize i had the mental load. i scheduled appointments, planned and organized everything. and i resented him for a while because i’d do all the grocery shopping, all the meal planning, almost all the cleaning and preparing and etc. at our old apartment, we were only given one assigned parking spot. i usually gave it to him since by the time he got home from work, he would have to park in the verrry back of the complex. since i got home earlier, i had better chances of finding a spot closer to our apartment. there were days when i was completely unlucky and had to park in the back. sometimes on those days, i’d have to pick up groceries so imagine walking from the very back of the apartment complex to our apartment which was closer to the front. one day i had to get essential groceries. i was wearing my office clothes (skirt, high heels, blazer, etc.) and i didn’t realize that by the time i got home, it was freezing cold and drizzling. i had to park in the back. exhausted, i didn’t want to call him because i actually wasn’t sure if he was home yet. i walked for 15 minutes, high heels on, no umbrella because both my hands were holding heavy groceries so i was getting wet, and i was shivering from the cold. got to my apartment, went straight to our closet, and cried my eyes out while he was in the kitchen completely unaware of what i was doing and how i felt. when he asked me what was wrong, i told him that i had to walk super far with heavy groceries (i can’t really carry anything heavy since i have scoliosis) and his response was: you should’ve asked. he knew i was stopping by the grocery store on my way home. he knew i would have to carry it. he knew i’d have to park really far and i couldn’t stop in front of the apartment since there’s no space for cars to stop. 

i still feel this way from time to time. ive actually been feeling this way this entire week, and have been making snide comments because honestly i don’t have the mental or physical energy to even discuss it. we’ve gotten into many arguments (more like in depth talks because we don’t often argue) about how i feel like i do everything, but he always responds with “i help out all the time.” he’s a huge sweetheart and usually does what i ask but i always say “i shouldn’t have to ask you to do things around the same house that you live in.” but now that i know that there’s a word for it, and also that brilliant comic that someone commented on below, i think it’s time to talk to him again. and hopefully it resonates.


edit: i just shared this post and the comic AND the huff post article with my husband. he resonated the most with the huff post article and said that he never thought of it that way and didn’t realize that that’s how i felt. so.. i’m looking forward to inevitabl discussing this with him when we get home from work and see where it goes. i love all you wonderful ladies. this single thing helped me address the biggest issue in our new marriage. 🤍"
1853,"When I got married 30 years ago, I just didn't assume the load to begin with.  Lots of adjusting (mostly by him), but if I didn't do it, it didn't get done.  So it didn't get done. I worked more than him ( and made more), I had a great excuse.  So now, I still don't have it.  It's....wonderful."
1854,"I am in the middle of a divorce because of domestic inequality. Kids made it so much worse. I thought I was doing the right thing by staying married until both of my teen daughters independently told me ""I am NEVER getting married. I am never taking care of some man."""
1855,"I am asking the following question completely earnestly because I want to understand:

When and how into a relationship do things start to become this way? Presumably before you moved in together, you lived by yourself and he lived by himself. Maybe with roommates, but I've never heard of roommates doing each other's laundry.

How does one transition from thinking ""my mom's birthday is tomorrow"" to ""I'm married now so my own damn mother's birthday is no longer my responsibility""??"
1856,Researching the safety ratings of household products? Have to say I don’t do this one
1857,"I had to tell my husband that I'm not the manager of the house and its not my job to delegate tasks that need to be done.  Also that he is my partner, not my child and I don't need to be telling him what to do.  I reminded him that he's a perfectly capable adult and does have the ability to say things like ""Is there anything around here that I'm not noticing needs done?"" Thankfully he has been able to pull from his work history to know what I meant by ""I'm not the manager"", and actually took it to heart."
1858,"Team, I've got to take this one step further:  We need to teach our sons how to shoulder the mental load.  It's not enough to teach our partners how to do it (and as the comments indicate, in a lot of ways that'll just never happen) we've got to actually be the change we want to see in the world.  We've got to make our sons do the work, be considerate, check in.  If we have expectations for them, they will rise to those expectations.  It doesn't even OCCUR to my mom to ask favours of my two brothers.  She only ever asks me and my sister for help.  But if I suggest to her she call one of my brothers, she'll act like it's THE BEST IDEA I'VE EVER HAD...like, it didn't even occur to her that they could be asked.  And they ALWAYS help - immediately.  They were so pleased to be asked.  It's a #facepalm moment for me EVERY TIME.  Sigh.  Because the flip side of this is that my brothers don't call her to check in - me and my sister do.  So we get stuck with the labour, because we care enough to ask.  Now I ask, and then delegate to them ha ha."
1859,"I think my bf would say that the mental load of this stuff mostly falls to him. I have comparatively limited executive functioning capacity, so I either just don't notice things that need doing, or forget to come back to doing them. He usually picks up all the slack. He's way more bothered by dirty floors and bathrooms than I am, so those tend to be his domain, whereas I mostly handle the laundry and dishes (he cooks; I clean). It's easy for me to notice when the laundry pile gets big, and dishes always happen after a meal, so that's easy to remember, too. I just fall apart on the stuff that isn't connected to other tasks."
1860,"How does it even get this imbalanced? 

My SO and I do pretty much everything together. If she starts cleaning, I start cleaning.  If I start cleaning, she starts cleaning. We do the groceries list together, we do the shopping together. There's even an unspoken agreement that if one of us needs time to relax, we both relax so no one needs to feel like they're letting the other one down.

 I recognize she's better at remembering things than me, so I set reminders on my phone. When the garbage reminder goes off, I get up and take out the garbage. She doesn't let me do the laundry (she has a system, I don't understand it) so I suggested we put tags on the baskets for dirty/clean so I can make sure at the very least, I always know where to put my dirty clothes and were to grab the clean ones.

When something doesn't get done, there is no blame because we work together. Sometimes the dishes will stack up and she will apologize,  and I just tell her that *we both* let them slide, not just her. If we were supposed to do them together, then we both failed.

I dont wait for her to ask for help, I get off my ass and ask of she needs help. Even if she doesn't need my help that's twice as much work she's doing, so I find something I can do for her. Its not a free pass to be lazy until she tells me I can sit down and relax. Maybe its cleaning the bathroom, or brushing the cat, but i do SOMETHING.

How can you care about someone and not want to work along side of them as much as possible? We help each other. Thats what makes life so much easier having her around, and that help is how I show her how much I love her and appreciate everything she does.

And since its relevant, we do have conflicting work schedules. We try and schedule chores when we're both home. Grocery shopping on Fridays for example, since we're both home at 3. Its not a matter of convenience,  just another challenge we work together to overcome."
1861,"This is what i've been trying to communicate with my partner for the three years we've been together. I love him so much, but days upon days of this, him just not seeing how draining this is, how much i'm doing, that i don't get to sit or breathe for 5 minutes; it makes me want to tear my hair out"
1862,"I asked my husband yesterday to empty some old flowers from a vase. He put the flowers in the bin, but left the vase and dirty water still standing on the table. When I asked him why he said ""You didn't ask me to empty the water"". I did a mental facepalm and had to ask him why he thought I wanted a vase of dirty water left on the table."
1863,"Yes! Or when they go to get groceries (after you check what you need and make them a list) and then get blow by blow messages while they're there.

(Although I guess checking in is often better than winging it if they have no idea what you're planning to do with said ingredients)."
1864,"Periodically reminding someone of basic things that need to be done is pretty exhausting. One needs to be on the lookout for things out of place, dirty, etc and be mindful of keeping the house organised all the time. Work on things as and when you see them. It’s all about helping each other to keep the place in order.

I believe it’s not too difficult to see another person struggle with things and you start helping them accordingly.

Sure, men have jobs but women have jobs too. Taking care of the household should be a collective effort."
1865,I have been mentally calling it “initiating” but this has more of an impact I think.
1866,"100% agree. I’ve found it helps to 1) put him “in charge” of certain tasks. Like, for example, he is responsible for figuring out what to cook for dinner every night and then cooking it. At first he f’d it up a lot and asked a lot of questions but over time he improved a lot and was excited to learn since it became one of his “things” and something he could be proud of.

And then 2) making lists and calendars for things that are repeat tasks. It’s more work upfront but once it’s done I can just say, “Check the list!”

It’s all completely unfair but I sincerely believe he means well and is just genuinely unaware, so I am trying to be a good manager and develop his talent. 😜"
1867,My boyfriend doesn’t assume I need help until I ask for it which has its pros and cons. Sometimes I wish he would just jump in and help if I’m obviously cleaning around him. I’ve learned to maintain my stuff and not really touch his stuff and it cost us a $300 vet bill. He left cold medicine lying around and my dog ate it. He’s learned to pick up after himself more after that incident.
1868,"I actually ended my 6 years old relationship because of this reason. Every week we would have an argument about WHY I  DIDN'T ENJOY TELLING HIM WHAT TO DO ALL THE TIME, because he's not a little kid. He couldn't understand it and he didn't think he was doing something wrong."
1869,"Just wanna add that a bullet journal has seriously changed my life for this exact reason. Anytime you think, ""oh i need to do x"" or want to remember something, or remember to talk to someone. Write it down! I started doing this and my brain feels so much less cluttered."
1870,"Sit down together and make a list. Not just a list of all the things that weigh on you but his stresses and concerns too. Split that list into things that can be controlled and things that can't. Of the things that can be controlled, devise a rota in which you both can cover some of the others concerns whilst keeping it fair and equal. There will be some aspects that can be shared or completed together. It's important to remember that your partner isn't a mind reader and whilst you vocalise the thing that is pushing you close to the edge, he will be unaware of a lot of the other aspects that fill your head. Having them down on paper creates a visual representation of your concerns and turns it into a problem to be fixed. Us chaps very much enjoy fixing shit when we've been made aware that it exists to be fixed."
1871,"If you have to babysit your boyfriend,/husband/SO, start charging them for your babysitting."
1872,"I may be lucky, but I never considered these things my duty. If my partner implied such a thing, the relationship wouldn't last very long."
1873,"If he's going to act like a child, treat him like a child; buy a chore chart."
1874,"He's a grown ass adult who presumably isn't blind. As an adult, if you see something dirty, you clean it. If you don't know how, look it up. Amazing how people have all these resources but refuse to use them.

Don't date someone who is determined to perpetually remain a child. Tell him to grow up."
1875,"I'm curious why I keep seeing this called ""emotional labor"" because that is already a term that means something quite different. I understand that terms can have multiple meanings, but it's just weird to me.

""**Emotional labor** is the process of managing feelings and expressions to fulfill the emotional requirements of a job. More specifically, workers are expected to regulate their emotions during interactions with customers, co-workers and superiors."" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional\_labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_labor)"
1876,"Try the app Tody! 

It’s mainly for cleaning and chores, but you can easily add other things (I have a “room” that is for tasks related to my cat’s care, another “room” that is self-care tasks, and I use the “office” room for legal and financial tasks).

If he’s actually just poorly conditioned, and not an asshole trying to find excuses, it should not only open his eyes to all of the things that need doing (and highlight for both of you what you each prioritize), but also clearly show you both who is doing the lion’s share of that background work; AND, if he then does the right thing and makes an effort to follow it, it will also actually build the habit in him of noticing when these things need to be done.

But if there’s no self-directed, continuous improvement over time? Even with the app? Well, then you know what you are dealing with, and can just throw out the whole man, really."
1877,This is one of the main reasons I ended my last long term relationship. It’s exhausting having to either do everything or tell him what to do and I hate feeling like I’m either a maid or a nag.
1878,"“I don’t want a kid, I want a co-manager” 

If I have to tell you what to do all the time, than you’re a child...but I’m not your mom. I want to do things equally. I want you to take initiative.

But also, COMMUNICATE.

My roommate and I grew up with two very different ideas of clean, so we had to sit down together and discuss how often certain chores needed to get done. There were also things that I didn’t see the need for and if she wanted it done she’d have to do it herself, and vice versa. 

In the end, the housework was split 50/50, and we were both happy"
1879,I think this is little outdated. I’m and I’ve been the person that Does some of these task In different relationships. Likewise I’ve had live in girlfriends that took on some task that might be traditionally assigned to men. You work together to both do what you’re good at as individuals
1880,"I feel like this with both my girlfriend and my roommates. It feels like I'm not only responsible for getting shit done, but figuring out what needs to be done. It's mentally exhausting to be the planning and doing committee constantly, and while I appreciate that whatever I ask to get done will get done, I don't enjoy having to ask. Most of the time it's easier to just do something myself than track people down, and I somewhat resent that grown ups can't find a way to be proactively helpful."
1881,That's what a chore chart is for! I totally get it though... It's so emotionally draining I normally just do it myself
1882,"And somehow, when women say ""that's too much work for me, I won't do it"" by choosing to stay single or be childfree we're villified for that too."
1883,My last relationship ended because of the emotional labor fights.
1884,"Wow, my boyfriend calls me OCD and a control freak but it’s so annoying - I hate picking up after him. He says I nag when I tell him to do certain things - ya it becomes nagging when I constantly have to remind him. It’s so frustrating and it’s such a deal breaker for me. We’ve bumped heads because I feel like he’s lazy but he’s honestly just so oblivious. He will ask me what needs to be done but why do I need to tell you? Just take a look around. We had a cleaner come to our place every Friday every second week before this whole COVID19 pandemic - it’s really not that difficult to wipe the stove down from the oil you get on it or to wipe the bread crumbs off the stove? I don’t get to vent to anyone about it cause I don’t want him to come off as a lazy slob cause he’s not - he’s just SO oblivious! Rant over lol!"
1885,"Right!!! For real, I have enough on my plate. I shouldn’t have to tell you the trash is full and needs changed. Or the dishes are piling. Be a man and help me out!!"
1886,This is called being an adult.
1887,We are  aren’t your mothers! Lazy jerks . Grow up
1888,"My boyfriend and I recently had a big argument because my mental health is really low right now (I’m getting help) and I’ve been taking it out on him. He’s right, and I told him that and together we worked out that while that’s my problem, his is that he doesn’t communicate any issues he has with me until he blows up about it. We’ve figured out that since adhd has made his memory pretty crap, I’m happy to remind him of things that he needs to do, and in return he needs to pull me up any time I take stuff out on him or even just do something he doesn’t like, with no exceptions. It’s been a few weeks and this works really well, but now that I’ve been making a conscious effort to focus on myself & my habits etc. I’ve found that while I was pretty much already doing things like remembering things for my boyfriend, it’s really fucking exhausting. The good thing is I don’t feel like I’m acting as his mother when I’m doing it anymore like I used to, and that makes it worth it, because I can see that he’s making an effort to improve as well. But the sheer effort I unintentionally put in every day to remember everything of my own that needs to be done, as well as his, is insane and I never realised it before."
1889,THIS. Not to mention the woman usually has to do the bulk of the emotional work as well
1890,Truth
1891,"I literally had a conversation with my boyfriend’s cousins girlfriends like last week. It’s literally everywhere. My boyfriend and his cousins have mom’s that do EVERYTHING for them. His one cousin lives in another state and his mom makes appointments for him to see the orthodontist. My boyfriend had never had to do a single chore. They’ve been enabled and babied and it’s become our problem. Recently, the cable guy came to our house earlier than expected and my bf jumped up and started sweeping the floor and putting away the dishes. Apparently I was giving him a crazy look because he asked why I looked like I wanted to kill him!!! Lol. Like, oh so you SEE this mess too??? I told him to treat everyday like the cable guy is coming."
1892,"Idk about all of the other stuff but your title caught my eye because my husband is the same/similar. He would clean if I asked him to but is he going to use his eyeballs and decide himself that something should be cleaned? Probably not. It’s frustrating but there are other things, positives, that outweigh this."
1893,They don't understand that people who remind you of your tasks are managers and they are paid accordingly.
1894,Ugh. That’s the worst. Mental exhaustion is real. I’m having a hard time with projects during quarantine too! Now that I’m working from home I see every little thing that needs attention in our house. On my “lunch break” I patched up a section of wall in the living room lol
1895,"I knew my fiance was a keeper when I heard him say ""I know it takes less energy to just do it yourself, sometimes. I'll try to remember it, myself.""

My exes, brother, and dad were all really bad about the ""tell me what to do"" mindgame, basically to the point of gaslighting.  
Because it starts with ""just tell me what to clean"" and leads to ""that doesn't need to be cleaned"" or ""oops I forgot, remind me again"" to ""oops I forgot"" to ""oops I forgot"" to ""why are you mad???"" to ""why didn't you just remind me"" (""I did"") and on and on.

Why do so many people just fucking lie all the time? I think I might be autistic because I didn't realize how often ""good people"" lie until I was like, 30.  
I'm really grateful I finally grew a bullshit detector."
1896,"Every man I have ever lived with or dated has been like this. My boyfriend tries to rely on me for literally everything. He doesnt do laundry, doesnt cook, doesnt clean. Since living with me, he has never bought groceries or household items. Half the time, we dont even have food because I cant afford to keep the kitchen stocked every single day. And he never fucking chips in. I've talked to him about it a million times and he just doesnt care. I mean, he pretends to care but if the behavior isn't changing then he obviously doesnt care. 

This idiot is a grown up and expects me to set my alarms and wake him up every morning. He expects me to tell him when he has appointments or when to clean something or just anything he needs to remember, he expects me to remind him.  For example, he is always losing his wallet. Leaving it at home or losing it elsewhere. Whenver we would leave the house, I would remind him to get his wallet. I told him I'm not doing that anymore. If he forgets, then that's on him. And he has forgotten a million times since I stopped reminding him. 

Honestly, I'm at my wits end with this guy. Its created so much resentment in our relationship that I cant stand the sight of him. I literally re coil when he tries to kiss me. I can't even have a conversation with him about my day or whatever is going on in our lives because I'm just so mad at his willful negligence. 

Hes a peice of shit and I never should have let him move in. Jason, if you're reading this, fuck you."
1897,"This is what it means when women say, “ I shouldn’t have to ask you to pick up the dirty laundry on the floor. If you see it, you should just pick it up!” Because we don’t wait around to get asked to pick up the clothes. We don’t even stop there. We pick up the clothes, we take the whole hamper to the laundry room, and wash them. But that doesn’t stop there either, because once they are washed and dried they can’t just stay in the dryer. They have to be put back where they belong. If you see something needs to be done, can you do it? Don’t wait around for me to ask you to. Just do it. This is *our* home, not just mine. We both make the mess, so we both need to clean it. We both need to take responsibility for things, not just the bills."
1898,What about when the man does all of this in a relationship?
1899,"Why are so many women still in relationships with men who do this? Why do you all think this is better than being single.

You are all making your lives shorter by being with children like this. Don’t date man children."
1900,What? Not trying to be rude but I don’t get it.
1901,"fun fact
it’s not your job, and you’re not a bad person for not picking up others’ slack in this situation.

For SOs like the one in OP’s title who want to be helpful but don’t understand this, communicate literally what the title says. Say you appreciate their help, then say that it’d be nice if they could check that object every week to make sure it’s clean, and clean it if it’s not or something. That’d help kill the repetitive requests to clean. Or ask for proactive cleaning, if you see a dirty thing, clean it. Or whatever works in your relationship, people divide chores differently.

not sure if i can say “bam problem solved” though because i don’t have the problem shown in the picture at all. i don’t have to tell myself “this isn’t your job because you’re a woman, you don’t have to feel like this,” i’ve just legit never felt that way and i’m weirdly proud of it for some reason even though it’s no special accomplishment. i’m also childfree so half these things don’t apply to me! i’d assume the way it should be is that you largely take care of your own needs and space, come to a compromise on shared spaces, and that’s it. offload the remembering birthdays and events stuff onto your phone, there’s a spot for birthdays in the contacts and you can get your calendar to notify you when birthdays or events approach.

idk i think this picture just bothers me so much for no particular reason. maybe because i don’t identify with the problems at all in the picture but they’re being presented as the normal thing. and why should that make me angry? it shouldn’t."
1902,Men do these things too!
1903,I’m a dude and I’m in the same boat as you
1904,"Literally my boyfriend has a meeting and didn’t even check when... the meetings were today and tomorrow. I asked him this morning (I had already checked, it’s tomorrow at 9) and he hasn’t checked. That was at like 11am..."
1905,The original phone reminder app.
1906,"little nitpick, ""emotional labor"" as a term is more used for describing the mental taxing nature of wage labor. IE when you have to pretend to be happy to costumers all day as a sales rep when you aren't inside. As much as the stuff mentioned in this photo can be mental draining, I feel using the term ""emotional labor"" for these things undermines the struggle that workers, both men and women, go though on a daily basis."
1907,This isn't just a female issue. It all depends on the relationship and I understand that it is more common that these burdens fall on women's shoulders but it isn't only women
1908,Life pro tip: trash items 1 and 2 in the left and item 3 in the right. Worked wonders for me and it actually didn't ruin my social life.
1909,I do all that with my girlfriend
1910,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, YES. I have been brooding all day thinking about this very thing. It's so frustrating."
1911,"Why is this lady smiling? Mental load sure as hell doesn't make me smile. Is she putting on a mask the pain or something?

edit: also, girl, you are not alone. This describe all three of my exes to a T. I guess I have a type?^(manchild)"
1912,"Yes, and men never have stuff in their mind."
1913,"Trying to get a SO to care about and take responsibility for things you care about significantly more than they do can be mentally tiring, yes."
1914,"Over half of that is completely unnecessary

You’d be less tired if you stopped making up stuff to do."
1915,"Just buy em a diary, it’s like a second brain to us forgetful folk"
1916,"So write it down.  Make a chore list of the things you need done and just point to it and say ""these are the things, do these"", and it doubles as helping you manage your own workload by not having to make it a mental load.

Scheduling is the easiest way to reduce mental load related to tasking, and it has the added benefit of being sharable."
1917,"Hold on, most of these you experience when living by yourself and get use to, this just sound like more excuses so not to do your fair share around the house and get carried by your partner."
1918,This is called “being an adult”. Deal with it.
1919,What a circlejerk this is
1920,"Man I just don't give a shit about most of those things and it's not my fault you do. Just being honest, feel free to leave."
1921,"Women- “gosh guys women aren’t mysteries! We’re just people! Talk to us and communicate with us!”

Also women- “oh my god do you know how TIRING it is to for us to simply communicate what we want like a normal human being? How dare you not just read or minds?!?!?”"
1922,So you're complaining about something that all people not just women have to do.
1923,"Not to be pedantic, but the vocabulary is wrong here. Work like this that's done at home is actually called ""reproductive labor"" and refers to the stuff that is necessary to keep society going (caring for kids, doing laundry, preparing food) that isn't paid (or often appreciated in any way). ""Emotional labor"" refers to the emotional management that has to happen during your paid job (having to flirt with/tolerate flirting from customers as a bartender)."
1924,"Oh man what a terrible workload.. You could eliminate about half of this stuff and be perfectly fine. Unpopular opinion? Maybe, but taking it out on your spouse because of your own concept of perfection and time management is offensive and I've walked out of relationships because of the ""busy-body"" mentality. We create our own stress based off our surroundings and the different ways we live and it shouldn't be someone else's fault."
1925,It feels tiring to even think of being in a relationship with a person like the girl in the picture.
1926,"Literally my boyfriend has a meeting and didn’t even check when... the meetings were today and tomorrow. I asked him this morning (I had already checked, it’s tomorrow at 9) and he hasn’t checked. That was at like 11am..."
1927,"Now imagine carrying this *without* a boyfriend or partner. Maybe the ""date night"" things go away (and replaced by social emotional labor involved in going places/meeting people!) - BUT that just leaves more stuff in the other categories with ABSOLUTELY no way to offload the mental load!"
1928,[deleted]
1929,"My ex-wife was exactly the same way but she never ever brought any of it to my attention. Yeah, I said ex-wife.

""Anything I can do to help?"" 

""No, I got it."""
1930,"This comic enhanced my marriage. I first brought up the concept of the “mental load” to my husband and he was pretty offended/indignant. I said, just read this comic. Once he did, he felt terrible for being so defensive and admitted there was some truth to the comic, even though it’s not as extreme for us as a child free couple. He now has daily reminders set in his phone to check the fridge, add to the shopping list, and made an effort to get more involved with our finances. And he’s kept up with it maybe a year or so later! I’m so lucky to be in a relationship with him and appreciate the efforts he makes."
1931,"Oh my God, that has touched a nerve. Explains everything so clearly. Ten years married, 2 kids and while he does most of the food shopping and well over half the cooking, the mental load of reminding him to empty the bins or wash the children's faces before they leave the house, or having to do all the cleaning and vacuuming myself because otherwise it just won't get done properly has nearly broken me in half. Before this virus stuff, I thought I was going to have a breakdown. It makes me so mad because I can see that it shouldn't be that way but I don't have the energy to - repeatedly - explain that this is a load I am physically worn out from carrying. And I feel immense guilt for feeling that way. I can't do this any more. We'll get through this virus thing and then we'll see what comes next."
1932,"I’m going to show this to my bf bc I’ve reached my limits of being able to sanely explain this burden. I had a few breakdowns about being overwhelmed w all the things that need to be done with the stress and deadlines from work as a cherry on top of the things at home. 

The last mental breakdown I had with all this, I told him that I refuse to marry him bc the prospects of babying him and raising kids is not how I like to spend the rest of my life. He made some habit changes, but old ways creep back. This comic should make it clearer though with what I mean with overwhelming mental burden"
1933,"Ugh, don't read the comments. Literally the SECOND comment is a man mansplaining what a job is. Like, he honestly thinks women have never had a job and don't know what it is or what it requires.

Then women come in to explain the post further, and try to get the guy to understand that he's not getting the point of the post.

And yet ANOTHER man comes in to say that women just don't understand jobs.

Yup, we just don't get this whole ""job"" thing. None of us work so we just don't know."
1934,This is the article that woke me up. I'm not taking crap like this in a relationship again. I'd rather be lonely.
1935,"I'm a husband who's terrible at emotional labor - I can't identify what chores need to be done, I'm bad at remembering things, I'm bad at organizing social opportunities. For some of these, I've built systems (like reminders) so that I can't forget them. But the real thing that makes our marriage work - because no matter how hard I try to change, for now at least, I'm a beginner, prone to mistakes - is that we acknowledge mental and emotional labor as real labor. She is not the unacknowledged manager of our household - she is the actual manager, and we take that work into account when dividing tasks. There are days when her chores consist of just making the chore list - because that's a fair tradeoff with me doing all of the other chores.

Even that wouldn't help, though, if I weren't putting in effort seeking where I can help, as often as I can. I may not be able to identify what the optimal thing is for me to be doing at any time, but it doesn't take emotional labor to know that I \*should\* be doing something, and either figuring it out (which I try to do as often as possible, and slowly but surely, am getting better at), or communicating clearly and kindly about the current situation."
1936,Yeah this is why it's going to take A LOT to get me to live with a man again.
1937,"I think that it is also important to date or marry people with similar ideas about what work needs to be done and with similar values. 

For instance, people often have different ideas of what 'clean' means. One person might think they've done a great job and the other finds it half-assed because it did not meet their idea of cleanliness. Some people are okay with stuff lying around, other people need it to be very clean all the time to avoid being stressed.

For example, I'm completely fine living in a space that is a disorganized mess. Often I don't notice because that's just how I live. I would never date a person who greatly values a super clean space because I just can't keep up with that and I also do not value that."
1938,"It’s so fucking nice to have a visual because when you take on the mental load, sometimes you’re too drained to even put it into words"
1939,"I love this comic. I had never seen it before. I want to show it to my boyfriend, but I don’t know how to bring it up. It’s like I don’t want to offend him if that makes sense? I’m tired of picking up after him, but I’m also really non-confrontational :/ it’s almost an emotional burden onto itself"
1940,Came here to post this.  Emma explains it nicely.
1941,"I sent this to my boyfriend today who then sent me this message “That’s an interesting piece , you should read this one as is covers a LOT about how I feel and maybe it will help you get my perspective .  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/anger-in-the-age-entitlement/201507/living-resentful-or-angry-partner%3famp”
So it just went right over his head"
1942,"I love this comic! It is definitely not gender specific... The way we were raised in society does lend itsself to being a gendered issue, but believe me. It's not. I think mothers do this for all of their children, not just their sons. And it causes issues for those women's partners, whether its a man or a woman. 

Case in point: make your kids do chores"
1943,"THIS WAS AMAZING! Thanks SO MUCH for sharing. 

So clearly understood with easy to digest examples.

&#x200B;

Nailed it!"
1944,"Completely bullshit comic full of unsubstantiated claims, and oriented around a totally skewed mindset."
1945,"My own, personal experience with this (guy btw)

In college I lived with my grandma for awhile.  One day we both came home at the same time. We walked into the living room and she asked me ""What's wrong with this picture?"" I looked around the room and said, ""You have 3 messages on your answering machine and your Tivo (dating myself here) needs an update.""

She said, ""Your backpack is on the floor, and you left the dining chair pulled out."" I legit had not noticed either of those.  She hadn't noticed the stuff I mentioned.

We had two completely different experiences when looking for what needs to be done. So it strikes me as kinda sexist when people just assume that men don't care, or want to be managed, or figure its women's work, etc. In my case, and I would assume many if not most others, its simply a difference in priorities.

I ask my wife what I can help with because as far as I'm concerned everything's fine. SHE may prefer the carpet be vacuumed again after a couple days, but to me it's fine the way it is. If I maintain the house according to what I see wrong with it, she'd either be unhappy or would end up doing everything herself, and that's certainly not fair to her. So I ask.

Conversely, there are household duties I maintain because I notice them and my wife doesn't. That doesn't mean she's relying on me to manage and delegate, it just means we notice different things to do."
1946,"I feel you. My bf is exactly like this too. He'll stack dirty dishes on the counter because the dishwasher is full of clean dishes, instead of emptying the dishwasher and then putting his dishes in. 

I have to tell him to do things when it's obvious they have to be done. I hate it because it makes me feel bad, controlling, and like his mom. But I also don't want to do all of the chores myself because I'm not his maid either. No matter how much I try to explain why it bothers me and why I wish he would just do stuff if he notices it needs to be done, he doesn't get it. It's distressing."
1947,Fucking hell are you me??? My husband and I have been fighting about this. He just doesn't know how to clean up after himself and it feels like I have grown ass 3 year old man. Also  I think he is a hoarder.... He doesnt like to throw away things because he thinks he'll use it later on. But he won't of course. It'll sit there and sit there forever I do something about it.
1948,"In an other thread on a similar topic someone asked that if people acted the same at a job (needing to be reminded at every chore etc.) would they be able to keep that job? 
At work you are expected to take responsibility over your work, why is it different at home?"
1949,">and I don’t think my friends would really understand

Oh, I bet they do.

Would you tolerate a child not picking up after themselves? Why do you tolerate it from an adult?"
1950,"I legit made a chores list and stuck it to the fridge. If we have to baby our guys, then I’ll go all out, even down to the color coded boxes to let you know to clean our cat’s litter lol"
1951,"I stopped doing it for his family a while back too. If I am feeling like maybe writing out some holiday cards I'll do it, but if life is busy his family is no longer a priority for me. He acts like it's a hassle to just sign his name to the cards, and his family has never once reciprocated anyway, so clearly it can't be that important to any of them."
1952,"It's just... shit. I find that even if we refuse to do these things it ends up reflecting badly on us.

A really recent example - my husbands uncle passed away, a man I had met twice in my entire life who lives on the opposite side of the world to us. We messaged his wife with condolences. Several weeks later I find out the aunts aunty has passed away too. I message her another round of condolences and she has a go at ME about our lack of contact and care?! I'm like, lady I can count on one hand the number of times I have spoken to you in 12 years. She didn't message my husband, her actual nephew, at all.

So it was apparently all my fault and my responsibility to contact and care for a woman I've barely met just because I am married to her nephew."
1953,"The downside to this is the possibility that they may not rise to the occasion. And then everything falls apart because no one is doing the labor.  For some people this may trigger the light bulb but I still think communicating is important because at the end of the day, their priorities are not going to be the same as yours.  So if you just suddenly stop doing things and expect them to pick up the slack, there's a good chance that they won't."
1954,"I’ve tried not doing things in my way of petty retaliation (for lack of words) and hoping he’ll learn, things became a mess and I was becoming negatively affected."
1955,"The problem with this is that my husband has a higher threshold for messy than I do. Like, I don’t usually worry about dusting, but I don’t like leaving food trash around. He hates doing dishes, and so do I, so I end up having to do them because I cook and I need shit to cook with."
1956,"Sometimes refusing works, sometimes they even get the point and mean to change but don't. My conscientious, feminist partner is smart and amazing in so many ways, but he's just...sight-dumb? Change blind? For instance, he leaves half used paper towel/napkins on every flat surface. I'm talking like 7 a day. How? Who knows, but its every day. (Used floss too!)

After I've tried discussion, reason, frustration, and refusal to no avail, I get petty as fuck. Make it HIS problem, and suddenly they start noticing on their own before it reaches critical mass.

Don't pick up your many napkins for the millionth time in a row? Suddenly you have greasy day old paper towel stuffed into your slippers every day. Never pick up the dog shit? Suddenly there's a huge pile at the bottom of the stairs. Never dust the tall stuff I can't reach that gives the dog major allergies? Boom, a huge wad of dust clumps end up on your pillow. Strip off all your clothing into a pile in the middle of the hall making me trip in the dark AGAIN? Weirdly, your laptop is now sitting open on that pile. Never grocery shop? Fridge is now full of broccoli, pork, almond milk, and non-kosher frozen meals. 

I've not resorted to all of these, but sometimes it's nice to plan petty ahead.

We have a great, teasing relationship, so he rarely gets irritated, and always sees more of the magnitude of the problem. He responds and I'm not resentful! (Then he intentionally buys candles I dislike the smell of in retaliation. We have fun here lol)"
1957,"""It’s why the sexiest thing a man can say to his partner is “I got this,” and then take care of whatever needs taken care of."" Preach."
1958,"Fuck, I cried. I wonder if this will help my husband understand where I’m coming from. I’ve explained that behavior like that makes me feel unloved, but he doesn’t seem to get it. He is trying a little anyway, but it’s really nowhere near enough."
1959,"That's a great article.

My takeaway from it is that I should start flirting with his best friend in order to make my husband understand what the words ""it really upsets me"" mean, but I don't think that's the writer's intention."
1960,I sent this article to my husband who got in a furious rage with me and is now has been ignoring me all night. Great.
1961,"Yooo, things make so much more sense now. Thank you for sharing this."
1962,">Men are perfectly capable of doing a lot of these things our wives complain about. What we are not good at is being psychic, or accurately predicting how our wives might feel about any given thing because male and female emotional responses tend to differ pretty dramatically.

When shit is dirty or out of place, clean it or put it back. No psychic powers necessary. 

This post has really triggered me btw. Thank you so much for posting it"
1963,"wow, what a good one!"
1964,"Are you hispanic? That’s exactly how my mother is with my brother. I’ve never seen him do some sort of chore or his laundry. My mom showed him how to do laundry once and he didn’t like it so he just waits until its really full for my mom to see and she’ll do it for him because “poor baby doesn’t have any clean clothes”. I have had my laundry overflowing and no clean clothes before and my mom just yells at me (which is expected i don’t want her to do mine, but why would she do my brothers then?) That’s how it is for everything at my house."
1965,"I'm very interested in how the nature vs nurture comes into play for this topic. I am a female and I grew up spoiled and enabled, kind of like your older brother. Everything was done for me, I never cleaned up messes because I didn't really see the mess and didn't care, as well as knowing that if I ignored something long enough she would end up doing everything herself. By some miracle I am a normal adult who now feels guilty asking my mother for any help. I enjoy a clean space and I put effort into maintaining it. I'm sure that partly it's because of personality traits I've inherited from her, but I wonder if it's also partly due to being female and being shaped by societal pressures to be the ""cleaner"" in the household."
1966,"This is exactly the problem that I think is the root of all the frustration. Mothers are failing their sons in a huge way in our culture. Men are becoming man children because their mothers are overprotective. 

Men are properly raised when they are allowed to make their own mistakes and then held accountable for them.

If you keep mothering them well into their 20s then dont be surprised when they still act like children. 

No mother should ever do anything for their child that they can do themselves."
1967,I'm a project manager. I feel this lol
1968,"As a husband, and someone who didn't notice the mental load up until a few years ago when my wife (rightfully) went berserk on me, I totally agree with this.  It's ridiculous when a husband has to be TOLD what to do all the time, rather than just notice it and do it himself.

And here comes the downvoted part, the problem from my end was every time I noticed something and did it, I'd immediately be told, ""no, not like that.""  Sometimes I just want to put the dishes in the dishwasher or cut a goddamned onion my own way, without someone looking over my shoulder saying I'm doing it wrong.  I don't need a ""thanks"" or any kind of acknowledgement whatsoever, just needless criticism made me feel down all the time.

It didn't stop me from doing the dishes or cooking, I'm not a child, but it did make me feel extremely resentful."
1969,"I think it's shitty overall that society expects women just do the emotional labor to maintain relationships. I refuse to do stuff if I don't have the time or energy, I don't care if people think I'm weird....I value my health and well-being."
1970,So according them women are maids. Fuck that!
1971,"The last time I had a Mental Load breakdown, husband and I divided meal cooking chores. I cook during the week (I stay at home and the time he gets home can vary widely, it’s easier for me to cook M-F and get the kids fed) and he cooks on the weekends. Still working on the laundry, but just knowing I have two nights off from cooking is a great start for me."
1972,"do you have any boardgames? you could even play an online game together. there's apps for cards against humanity, scattegories, pictionary, etc. it sounds a bit silly but i usually have fun when i do it"
1973,"Other future quarantine date night ideas: 

* Read a book out loud to each other while cuddling (maybe a choose-your-own-adventure if you need more interactivity)

* Play a board game

* Create your own board game

* Plan an imagined future trip abroad

* Do a sexy photoshoot with each other

* Take a virtual dance class together (a lot of studios are hosting virtual lessons now, so you could learn swing or salsa together right in your living room)"
1974,Go for a romantic walk after dark
1975,"Yesss! I think my husband *seriously* underestimates the emotional labor involved in meal planning. I think it's because it's not something that ever stops. Like with dishes or laundry, you can kind of put it off if you want. It might look a little messy, but it rarely HAS to be done right then. But like... we have to eat... every day. And my husband will notttt learn to cook, even though I've begged him to a million times!"
1976,"You could communicate how taxing it is to your partner. 

Then try making a two-to-three week meal plan together and simply repeat it, substituting in new meals when desired or for special occasions. It takes time to set up and get comfortable with, but saves a lot of hassle down the road."
1977,"Me and my SO do a tradeoff. One week he does meal planning, the next week I do. Asking for help with cooking or the groceries on your week is 100% fine but it’s YOUR responsibility to make sure it gets done that week. I did have to adjust my standards a little bit. His cooking is often repetitive, and a little less healthy. I cook in large batches and usually super cheap. But at least he knows how to follow a recipe and cook basic shit, so it’s fine."
1978,[deleted]
1979,"Some men rely on one woman after the next to do this for them and manage to get away with it their entire lives. My uncle's a prime example of this. He actually lives with his sister (my aunt) when he's not on business trips for the sole reason that he passes the mental load onto her when he's not in a relationship, because Jesus does he go through relationships - it's a new woman every few months and has been since 2006 when he got divorced. He has never cooked a meal for himself, or washed his own underwear I don't think since his days in the army. He relies on any woman around to take care of the emotional needs of his kids and just throws money at every other kind of need. He's 56. He's spent his whole life playing this game."
1980,"so i think it goes like this: he never knew his mother's birthday; but now that you're together his mother expects you to know and remember it. there's an expectation placed on you as a couple that was never placed on him as an individual.

he never cleaned up after himself. his mother did it when he was younger, and when he was living with roommates they all just lived in filth. and you, as a woman, think that he will ""grow"" out of this behaviour, that as he becomes a man he will take on these responsibilities. like how you transitioned from watching your mum cook dinner to helping her chop the veggies to eventually cooking every day for yourself. but some men don't grow, don't go through this transition. 

these men will also try harder at the start of a relationship. there's a million memes out there about guys cleaning their house to try and impress a girl. but they see it as a short-term courting behaviour, not a way of showing respect to their partner in the long-term."
1981,"I work with a bloke and I have reminded him of his mum’s birthday, because him and his brothers couldn’t remember when it was. He’s 37. I made him put a calendar reminder in. Every time he has annual leave, he takes his washing down and she cooks for him, because otherwise he lives on KFC."
1982,"Seriously lol, I can't imagine"
1983,"I do, but I buy most of my stuff at a small local store that belongs to a nice elder couple (they're great people, really) and most of the stuff there already is good in that regard so if I need to check anything it's only about specific stuff such as allergies. It's more of a hassle when I want to get something that they don't carry since that means going to a bigger store where they have everything and then some, but I can deal with researching a few products every month and I have a checklist of things to look out for which makes it much easier (if I see 20 products, that's a hassle; if 15 of them aren't even considered from the get-go, it's less of one).

That said, a lot of this isn't about deadly things that kill you but more about avoiding certain things so that they don't irritate your body in some way. For example, I have a really sensitive nose and there are a few substances used in a lot of air fresheners that make me sneeze and have a runny nose, and if I need to get an air freshener (I just use small amounts of flower-scented essential oils, diffused in water and put out of reach, if it's for me) then I will research this stuff, every single one there is in the store if need be, to make sure there's no problems with whatever I get.

And yeah, if you just buy the same thing over and over, there's not much research to be done. The thing is, if the guy doesn't buy groceries and doesn't pay attention, he likely won't get the same thing as you do and may not make sure that it's not something that will end up being an issue. A good comparison here is sending a guy out to get tampons: unless he's been trained to pay attention (mental load!), given a photo of it to show to the store clerk (mental load!), or simply is that mindful of you (yay for you, and congratulations!), he may end up getting scented ones in the wrong size or something."
1984,"> (she has a system, I don't understand it)

If she's anything like me, I can tell you that it's about material types and then colours. Some materials can handle pretty much everything, some other materials require a more delicate approach, and depending on the material and the kind of dye used for it you may be able to mostly disregard the colours or you may have to separate them into similarly-coloured stacks.

Jeans are very fun there, as quite a few jeans that are about-blue, unless you do something specifically to counteract that, have a dye in them that very easily comes off and onto other materials if you wash them together, which means that even if they are similarly-coloured I wouldn't wash anything made of jeans with anything like underwear or stuff made of silk or satin or whatever because it may end up staining the other things. Likewise, some black dyes can be the same problem, with the caveat that washing other black stuff (that's not underwear) with it is fine but anything else may stain."
1985,"To be fair, it's understandable sometimes.

My ex-fiance hasn't been best with mental load, but if you sent him out to get something and told him what to get he would get just that unless the instructions were ... not specific enough (I do remember he once got some nonsense instead of what I wanted because the nonsense technically fulfilled the requirements too, but I don't remember what it was right now). One time I was very tired and close to my period and low on supplies (bar tampons, but no thank you if I have other options) so I sent him out for sanitary napkins, and he ended up sending me message after message because they were out of those particular ones and he didn't know what else to get as he's only seen me use two different types, one day ones and one night ones."
1986,This reads like your training a fucking dog.
1987,And watch that shit get ignored like everything else she tells him to do
1988,Or save your money and dump him.
1989,The problem is that a lot of men have no problem living in their own filth. Everyone is complaining on here as though men are intentionally emotionally neglectful when the reality is that men just don't care about the majority of things women care about.
1990,"Yuuuup. My adult brother lives with us, and I have the highest cleanliness standard. Having expectations charted gives me sanity. We have a rule, too, that if the chore isn’t done, its up for grabs and whoever was supposed to do it owes money to whoever actually did the chore. It takes a lot of the burden off of me, even though the chore chart itself is still a pain to make."
1991,We are currently fighting because of this and I knew bringing it up would cause problems because his self-esteem sucks. We have barely spoken in days. I can't fucking win no matter what I do.
1992,"So the magic words in your household are ""the cable guy is coming""?"
1993,🙄
1994,Your comment history scares me lmao
1995,Fr. Most of this stuff is completely inconsequential
1996,"It's just an image to describe the mental load, it's just examples. The comic that's top comment describes it better in detail.

Also interested in which ones you think are unnecessary. I do all of them."
1997,"I'd honestly love to hear a good response to this that isn't just a downvote.  

Along with ""stop worrying about pointless stuff,"" it doesn't address another big thing that can help you light your mental load, which is stop thinking that there's one correct way to do everything and every other way is incorrect.

The proper response to your partner doing something on their own is anything other than, ""no not like that."""
1998,"If you live on your own, you do it all. But you only have to take care of one person. When you live with another person, it should be 50 50, not one person carrying the other."
1999,"Yeah, sure, except when I'm living by myself I take care of my own messes and if something needs to be done then either it's an auto-repeat task (wiping the dust so that the air doesn't get stale, you have to do it every so often) and that is that or it's something that has to be done because you made that mess. If I'm living with someone and I clean up the table only for someone else to make it messy within the next hour and there's still the expectation that it's my job to make sure that it is not messy ... well, no, I'm not a cleaning service and expecting me to do it when it's not my mess and you could have simply spent a minute to put the junk that's not on the table in its proper place is just disrespectful and tells me that to you my time doesn't matter, and if you undervalue my time this much then I don't want to give any of it to you."
2000,Doing basic chores and running a household is being an adult. Some people aren't capable of doing it and make their partner take on the mental load. Those people should grow up and be an adult imo.
2001,Why...?
2002,"Ummm not relevant to this pic imo. The average man isn't affected by all if not most of those things you listed. It's not assumed that it's a man's duty to die in a street crime, die in industrial accidents, get imprisoned, etc."
2003,"Do you have eyes? Okay, then. You shouldn't need to ask your wife what needs to be done. Like, you are an adult, clearly you should be aware of what things need to be cleaned."
2004,"The point is that your ex wife probably organized and cleaned everything -- you even asking is you putting the mental load on her to tell you what to do. 

You're supposed to just clean, you're supposed to know birthdays, you're supposed to think about dinner/holiday plans, you're supposed to know what's going on with the kids at school. 

Telling your wife that she should delegate chores to you like a child *is* mental load."
2005,"If you couldn't see for yourself what needed doing before she did it, she didn't have energy to explain and hand over. This is exactly what the article is about. Women are expected to just do. Men stand around offering to help and are praised for doing so. This builds resentment and it sounds in your case, contributes to relationship breakdown. Ah well, maybe that's the women's fault too."
2006,"It’s pretty easy to see what chores need to be done, though. Just...look. Are there dishes in the sink? Wash those. Debris around the house that is out of place? Pick it up, put it where it belongs. Floor needs sweeping? Sweep it. 

I don’t understand having to be told what to do; you can see things around you, right?

Also, “no, I got it,” comes from the idea that we as women always need to be on top of our shit and if we ask for help with household stuff, we’ve failed. So feeling like a failure or a burden often prevents us from asking, which is also an issue we need to work on, but I really just can’t wrap my head around the idea that you can’t see what needs to be done. How do you get stuff done now that you’re single?"
2007,"I wish my husband had that reaction. Mine got really defensive and told me about all the things men have on their mind regarding work, and I couldn’t convince him to see my side."
2008,"My husband had the same reaction! Every time I tried to explain it, it just came off as accusatory but then I showed him this comic and he understood so much better. Now if I say mental load, it's me letting him know that I've felt over burdened and need him to step in."
2009,I love to hear this!! Good on you for extending the olive branch (probably for the zillionth time in your life) and good on him for bettering himself :)
2010,I’ve tried to bring this up to my partner several times through various articles and he insists that it’s his depression that keeps him from doing things and that’s why I need to ask him to (nevermind I also have my own mental health issues and still take care of the house). He says he’s not misogynistic so it can’t be he’s letting this problem continue because he’s a man and I’m a woman. It was so tiring to get through to him that I just gave up and still resent him for it.
2011,"Guuurl, I totally feel you. I’ve had my multiple breakdowns because of this, and I don’t even have kids so I can imagine how much more difficult this is for you. 

I hope this discussion sheds light on how to perhaps discuss this with your husband (like another commenter had mentioned) and feel like you’re not alone. ❤️"
2012,"Three years into a relationship with someone who I thought I’d marry, I left him. He thought that emptying the dishwasher, sweeping and mopping the floor once a month was helping. He didn’t see anything wrong nor did he want to change until I left and now it’s still about how hard it is for him. 
All I wanted was for him to pick up after himself. 
I hope the best for you, be safe with the virus"
2013,I'm sorry your going through that realization. There's nothing I can say to make it better but I want you to know I understand how hard it can be ❤️. Internet hugs
2014,"Like dude, I just want to be in a relationship with another fucking adult. Why is that so damn hard for them to understand?! I don't want to be with a child who can't fucking look around and SEE what needs to be done.

I'm so glad I'm not locked down with that little boy pretending to be an adult. I should probably thank him for showing me through his behavior exactly how deep into his C-PTSD he had fallen several months ago. That motivated me to gtfo and just in time, it turns out!"
2015,"And then there is Bryan who has the gall to ask how a woman could POSSIBLY do 25 times more hours of housework than their husbands when there is only 24 hours in a day. 

Not only is he indignant but also bad at math. I want to slap him."
2016,"I actually did a reverse version of this with my partner. I have an **incredibly** stressful job, and it's also very dangerous. I can't remember what spawned the argument, but I distinctly remember asking him, ""Do you understand what I do for a living?""

It took a while, but things did get better after that fight."
2017,"I think most men have no idea of what it's like to work a pink collar job. My husband is a desk jockey (it project manager) and can work from home. I'm a memory care specialist. If too many people call off, I can't leave work.

A lot of days, I don't get a useful lunch break, nor do I get my 15 minute breaks because our new manager micromanages everything, and scheduled them at times when it just is not safe to leave the residents. If it's a good day, I was able to leave the secure area to use the toilet at some point during a 10-12 hour shift. I spend all day figuring out their needs, coaching new hires, working with difficult residents, and advocating for my residents.  I average 60-70 miles walked during my 4 day work week.

I am tired in every sense of the word, especially at the end the week. Dinner is always a fight. It doesn't matter how much I plan, if it was agreed upon prior to the grocery run, but the day of, my husband is never in the mood for whatever was planned or easy to cook. I have to plan around his diabetes, and two family members with food allergies. When I ask what he wants, it's always ""I don't know"", and somehow I'm the bad guy for not guessing correctly.  I've gotten to the point where if he wants to act like a spoiled, picky child, he can go make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and I cook something the rest of the family enjoys.

He also thinks I should be working full time on chores on my off days, since technically I have off 6 days a pay period. It's awful having him work from home on my off days, because he just doesn't get that I need some awake time where I'm not constantly being interrupted to figure out someone else's needs. 

It also irritates him that most nights after I work, I am shitty company. After getting all the things done, I try to go to bed by 8, because I have to wake up at 4am to get ready for work. If I try to watch TV with him, I'm dead to the world about 2 minutes after sitting on the couch."
2018,I didn’t listen to you and I’m sorry. The comments are a toxic mess. Oh man.
2019,I recently broke up and this is so true. Thank you so much for reminding me
2020,This is exactly what feminists are asking for. Thank you so much!
2021,"I know you guys probably have a system figured out but what helped me remember things to do for my job was an actual schedule for every little task. I've done a similar thing for chores. So I wrote down what needs to be done, like, everything. (taking out trash, watering plants, texting mom if you haven't in a while, planning birthday presents, cleaning the air vent, making a meal plan, updating my resume etc.) Then I figure out how often something needs to be done and depending on what it is I put it into my wall calender (stuff that has to be done once a month or once a year) or into my planner (stuff like grocery shopping). There's also a list for stuff that's out of the ordinary (calling the landlord for repairs, renewing passport) that goes somewhere I can see it and in a couple of spots in my planner where I potentially have time to do them. I'm definitely not able to remember what needs to be done and when I last did it all the time but if I just stick to the schedule I'll be sure to do it regularly enough that there's no issue. I don't know if that helps you in any way but that would eliminate having to make a chore list- or you guys could have a running ""special"" chore list on the fridge where you can add stuff as it comes up instead of having to dedicate time to making a list. 

Props to you for working on it and communicating with your partner!"
2022,"Another helpful way to approach it is to say, ""I know there are a ton of things that need to be done. Which one will make things easiest for you if I do it right now?"" Coming in and volunteering rather than waiting to be asked is a good way to learn how to recognize what needs to be done and when."
2023,">she is the actual manager, and we take that work into account when dividing tasks

Lord, I wish I could hire you to beat this into my soon to be ex husband's head."
2024,"I have this same problem. I bounce back and forth between desperately wanting to show this to him/try to explain it to him and...not wanting to because I *want* to do everything and be his superwoman because he *does* work more outside the house than I do and provides so. much. support. for me in a different way - I have pretty severe ADHD and I'm just an emotional mess a lot of the time and he's an ANGEL at supporting me psychologically and that's a whole mental load all on it's on, so I worry that it's not fair to expect him to change his ways after forty years of social conditioning. And he does do anything I ask him too...and he's so proud when he does something extra...and it's not that he's terrible at cleaning so much that it is that I like things done a certain way and he doesn't want to do it that way...so I just continue being the unacknowledged household manager until I get more and more annoyed and then feel guilty all over again 🙄🤦😵"
2025,Good lord.
2026,"So you try to tell him why you are resentful and what he can do to help, and he's just like ""no you gotta stop being being resentful because it hurts me."" Completely ignoring why you are hurt and making it all about himself again. Why is he your boyfriend again?"
2027,"That's great that you and your wife have found a way that works, but this is a pattern. Take a look at the comments here, the reason for the comic being created in the first place is because so many women have experienced this with men specifically - it's a common occurrence, enough for someone to sit down and create this and thousands of people to share/discuss it. This isn't a priorities issue, or that different people notice different things, and it seems as though your comment is just putting blame on women that their standards are 'too high' and a bit ""not all men"". We know it's not all men, but it's a lot of men...enough for many women to relate to this comic."
2028,"I mean, isn't that exactly the point that's being made, though? You just said you know that your wife prefers things one way, and yet you still insist on asking her? That comes off as petty, if I'm being honest.

Both you and your wife should be meeting in the middle on things like this. You should do the things you know she'd appreciate you doing, and she should do the same for you. Neither of you should have to ask the other, once it's clear what's important to each of you. It's critical to communicate your priorities, and it's important for both of you to internalize and respect those priorities."
2029,"> its simply a difference in priorities

You're missing the point.  Understandably, perhaps, but it's on you to make an effort to understand.

Fortunately, this is simply explained with a quick example: 

The fastest way to develop an appreciation for a clean kitchen is to cook in it.  If you're *using* the kitchen all the time, you appreciate when the sink is free from dishes so you can actually use it without having to move things out of the way.  You learn to value clean surfaces that won't spread messes around as you work. An orderly pantry so you can grab what you need instead of searching or digging about.  A refrigerator that isn't choked by out-of-date leftovers forcing you to shove and pull and cajole just to get some fucking eggs.

It's not your priority because it's invisible to you, not because it doesn't matter.

It's not your priority because you've not given it any thought or had that responsibility.

I'm not saying there isn't some subjectivity to this.  People do have different standards about things, but it's so easy to vastly over-estimate how much of this difference is due to this vs. the practical realities of running a household.

And, even if you drill down to it and it's really just a matter of preferences, you both live in the same house.  Compromise is part of this, and you can't just throw up you hands and say it doesn't matter to you, so it just doesn't matter.

It's possible your wife is taking some obsessive, over-bearing extreme, imposing draconian measures to fulfill her neurotic need for order.  

Or maybe you're being a bit of a twat."
2030,"Yes this! And then if i try to explain how to do something properly or a different way, I’m being “condescending”. I’m literally about to throw away a 10 year relationship over all of this because it is so mentally and emotionally exhausting for me."
2031,All of these replies just make me wonder wtf is going on with men?
2032,"If he can't even be bothered to sign the card then theres no reason you should bend over backwards for him. Plus it would be different if they reciprocated like you said, but it would still be on him."
2033,"It sounds like stopping was a smart choice. If it wasn't important to his family or to him, there's really no sense in doing it at all unless you wanted to do it for some reason of your own."
2034,"Wow that really sucks. Though it sounds like a case of the older generational values being reflected on you rather than an actual fault of yours. Try to ignore that kind of thinking, I guess."
2035,"This. 
Me not doing the thing = no one does the thing and then we live in a disgusting house.
He doesn't give one shit about mess. If I don't cook a meal, meals don't get cooked. There is no dinner. 

I'm up to my neck, I've absolutely had it. At my wit's end. 
I battle a lot with depression and it makes doing anything beyond taking care of my own self and working almost impossible. 
Like I don't want to work all day and then work in my free time."
2036,"I wouldn't suddenly stop per say, but I would say ""Look, I'm not doing this anymore"" and then actually follow through."
2037,"I know what you mean, in some instances this just will not work until it directly becomes their problem. With things like this, I find that focusing on your needs and disregarding his after awhile becomes the only way to get through to them."
2038,"Wow, I can't even imagine my telling my husband to wash the dishes because I need them and him not doing it. Im sorry you have to deal with such a lazy ass."
2039,"This is a great example of how to deal with it. So many men are just coddled, and have never worried about it that it doesnt occur to them. I watched my MIL do this the other day when her other son slept in our hotel on a family vacation.

She came over, fluffed his pillows and turned down his bed for him like the maid. He never helps with things like cleaning up, bringing in the groceries, or basic food preparations, but his twin sister is called out for not helping all the time."
2040,[removed]
2041,Now I have to read the article.
2042,That says more about him than anything you did. He needs to examine why he felt defensive and is choosing to stonewall you. Good luck friend.
2043,Why are you married to someone like that? What a useless excuse for a person.
2044,"You might want to consider how you might feel after being sent an article like that. Just the title alone sounds like a threat, She/He ""Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes By The Sink."" 

If you could get past such a title to read the article itself, you find a long rant about all the things you might be doing wrong actually means your partner doesn't think you acknowledge, respect, or truly love them, and how if you don't fix those things your partner is likely to leave you.

Your partner isn't sitting down with you to talk about their concerns and feelings, or communicate what specific problems need to be addressed in your relationship in a constructive way. Instead they're sending you a threatening article out of the blue, accusing you of not loving or respecting them enough and are thinking about leaving you. 

As is often repeated, communication is the key to any relationship, and sending someone an ambiguous article to try explaining your personal feelings you likely haven't addressed recently isn't a great way to communicate. Perhaps try explaining your motivation in person and what you meant to communicate to him by sending such an article, so you can clear up any misunderstandings that are likely to exist between you two. And in the future after reading an interesting article such as this you might try organizing your thoughts and explaining what you learned to your partner, and if you think it will help them understand what you mean, then send them the article to further clarify things."
2045,Guilt.
2046,"It’s expected in those cultures I think, yes, but usually with the expectations that the men will “become” something and “pay” or “give” back to the mothers for their sacrifices and coddling. Which is ironic as this wasn’t usually the case, and I think why historically speaking women have a hard time with their mother in laws. As women are expected to pander to everyone for the good of the family, the daughters eventually saw the mom as the weight the mothers saw their daughters as. The moms often want their daughters affections and attentions when the daughters are older and the moms often need them. If they weren’t successful “repairing” the dynamic with their daughters, moms would try to cling to their sons to get respect and affection from the “preference” she instilled, only to undermine the value of the wife. This also doesn’t explain the huge numbers of single motherhood or failed marriages in those communities or maybe it does? Since the men’s problems are “magically” taken care of they assume they can “walk out” or defer them when they “mature” as well. Women are taught to consider motherhood to females to be a burden and a joy when it’s men because women have to rear future wives and mothers but what are they rearing men for by the pandering I wonder? Most parents are rearing boys to them have a good time will little resistance or fear or responsibilities while women are raised to be ready to give up their freedoms and live in fear for breaking out of mold for her own happiness. Very telling of our world I think no?"
2047,"My goodness isn't it the worst?! I'm Greek but I definitely identify with this. My mom immigrated in her 30's and was a powerhouse of a business woman, was widowed when I was 8 mo. old and my brother 2, but despite everything, still had these baked-in traditional conceptions of raising children. My grandpa would call and say ""How many girlfriends does [my brother] have?"" and ""Is inbettywhitewetrust married yet?"" in the same breath when I was 15 years old. Despite everything, she always taught me how important it was to be extremely self-sufficient in life and independent, and how valuable I was as a person. She was able to pay off her mortgage and raise us all by herself after my dad passed, so she was a huge inspiration for me in all aspects of life, maybe not in her coddling treatment of my brother, but in her endless strength and love for us as a whole."
2048,I was raised with my parents doing everything for me as well. Moving out put the mental load of taking care of a household into perspective and I definitely feel bad about how lazy I was before.  I just didn't realize what I was(n't) doing.
2049,"I really appreciate that you acknowledge your upbringing; there are so many jaded people out there that pretend like these aspects of their childhood haven't affected them in some way or another. Thank you so much for your extremely interesting perspective. I think living alone kicks you in the butt and makes you a decent person or at least a more productive one! You sound like someone who values independence, which as you said may also be attributed to your mom's characteristics. And you acknowledged that you feel guilt in asking your mom for help now, which sounds like you're an all-around good and well-intentioned person for looking beyond your own circumstances or what could be easy for you and, instead, genuinely caring about another person instead of being selfish. So many people (many of whom are men) lack this empathy as a result of growing up with only one perspective/having everything handed to them!"
2050,"See I've tried this but then for dinner on his two nights is like ramen and chicken nuggets. It's like really? In my own experience, even when chores are divvied up, men still do the bare minimum."
2051,"We did end-up making a nice dinner together and dancing together around the house. I think board games is a great idea (someone else suggest it as well), but we only have traditional ones (backgammon, chess, and checkers) and he absolutely destroys me in those. He is so competitive with them for some reason!"
2052,"I think that needs to be negotiated then. The problem is that ""You should just Know what to do!"" also has big issues. 

It effectively makes ""everyone in charge of everything"" so it means you're paying double the mental energy, and it means that you'll end up duplicating work - you're out of food, then both people come home with the same groceries; it requires too much mind-reading!"
2053,"So for a guy like this, wouldn't it be obvious from the start? Why would someone willingly enter a relationship like this and then complain about it?"
2054,"Yeah, it may very well be. Normally he'd get someone else in the family, likely a woman and possibly even his mother himself, reminding him of the birthday approaching, but now that you are together it somehow automatically fell onto your shoulders and it's expected that you will care about it because someone has to and if he can't then it's obviously going to be you.

Ah, casual sexism, how we love ye ... not."
2055,"That sounds exactly like what she says!

I need a guide or something that I can read to help me learn. I think its too complicated for her to try and teach it all to me. Ive always just thrown everything of mine in at that same time.

Its a bit of a brain bender to go from ""its a washer... it washes clothes"" to all of this super complicated clothes washing science, after never even considering it for my entire adult life.

I would really like to be able to help her more with laundry but I think she doesn't want to ""burden"" me with having to learn about it all. Maybe if I can figure it out on my free time and demonstrate my knowledge, she will be more comfortable trusting me with it. I think the way she sees it, is that since she's the one bringing in the complicated clothes, that its ""her"" chore to do, but thats not right. Its not her fault women's clothing is unreasonably complicated."
2056,"Unfortunately, women that have managed to overcome this situation have had to treat it that way. I refuse to do so and a decade in am still waiting for my husband to start acting like an adult while I slowly get more and more exhausted. Had I trained him like a puppy maybe our marriage would be functioning better at this point."
2057,Or how you teach a toddler to clean up their toys and help set the table.
2058,Yeah like doesn’t this just create more work for yourself
2059,"I assume you meant this as an insult but I don’t take it as such. First, having one partner be “in charge” of something is nothing like training a dog. Dogs are not trained to make decisions and explore their creativity. They are trained to execute a task. I would never look at a dog and say, “Hey, you’re in charge of lawn care. Come back if you have any questions!”

Second, so what if it were like training a dog? There’s a great Hidden Brain episode about how dog training techniques can be really useful for humans when we are learning a new skill."
2060,that’s my exact mindset. how do you just live like this haha
2061,"This is why I suggested a chore chart. If your house is being swept and mopped twice a week, it won't be filthy."

2064,What? lol why

2066,"> I try to get my girlfriend to research and buy well-reviewed video games I haven’t played, but she just doesn’t seem to care.  I don’t think she realizes the emotional burden she’s placing on me to do it all myself.

I’m 99% joking of course.  

Cleaning, social interaction and relationships, child care, etc are all things that all adult partners should take at least somewhat seriously.  

But we should all also keep some perspective and remember that we’re all different, and some things important to us may not be as important to others."
2067,[removed]
2068,"It doesn't feel that way to you? 

In addition to most stuff she is stressing about being useless. To me it gives a feeling of not having enough time, to never be able to think ""Eh, it'll be fine"". And complaining about not having any time because they spends their time doing useless stuff I'd prefer they didn't do in the first place.

They will never have enough time. Will take them not having enough time out on you. Even if you took over all the useless shit they are currently doing they would just find other useless stuff to stress about and take it out on you. 

But that is just the feeling I get, though I do trust my feelings. It also depends on the type of person you are. They might be totally perfect for some."
2069,[deleted]
2070,Because women don’t have work things on their minds too? Geez.
2071,"I battled this for 12 years and wish I had an easy answer for you - but there is none.

Maybe a therapist that specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy is your best bet. Your husband needs to UNLEARN a very deeply rooted idea of what cooperation is. GUARANTEED his mother did all the grunt work and dad would go to work and lounge around and do all the fun stuff on weekends.

THIS RUNS DEEEEP! And its CONSTANTLY reinforced by the media and yet again by their ""fellow bros"". 

Bring it up when you see it on TV or in magazines..a woman cleaning up the table during a dinner scene while dad just sits there. And point out who is in damn near every vacuum / swiffer commercial, parenting ad, etc...this is ""normal"". Just keep pointing it out again and again."
2072,"Mine tried that too. Except I’ve been the higher earner for our relationship. My job is also stressful and requires me organizing and considering people’s needs. So it’s all day at work and all day at home.
Couldn’t get him into the comic but I’m going to try again.
Or... so tempted to put little tally’s up for the simple things like changing the empty toilet paper roll. Why am I the only one who does this?"
2073,Because women don’t have anything going on at work too
2074,"If you work, that's your obvious retort.

If you don't work, and together agree that you'll take on more household responsibilities, then you need to try to make responsibilities as clear as you can.

Generally there's going to be a good deal of specialization in relationships.  The 'management' overhead is simply duplicated if both people have to worry about something.  So it makes sense to divide things up.

The next step is identifying where you can't do this, where shared effort is needed.  If both people feel like they need some authority/control over an issue, then they both need to take responsibility."
2075,Is it the 50s?
2076,"Same, now if I bring it up he just gets angry. Sigh."
2077,"Thank you, much appreciated. Don't worry it's not that bad I'm mainly feeling sorry for myself x"
2078,"I do wish that she'd separated the period in ""2.5"" a little more clearly in the comic. 

It is slightly hard to read and so 2.5 looks a little like 25."
2079,"I'm so sorry, that sounds so frustrating.

But finally--someone else who has a problem with a picky husband who doesn't like to choose what to eat for dinner!!! There are SO MANY posts on Reddit about how women are so indecisive and always say ""I don't know"" about what they want to eat. That is the exact opposite of my personal experience!

I know how hard it is to plan meals around diabetes, also! I empathize so hard with your post."
2080,"> Dinner is always a fight. It doesn't matter how much I plan, if it was agreed upon prior to the grocery run, but the day of, my husband is never in the mood for whatever was planned or easy to cook. I have to plan around his diabetes, and two family members with food allergies. When I ask what he wants, it's always ""I don't know"", and somehow I'm the bad guy for not guessing correctly. 

So basically, he's just being an asshole about it for no real reason. Why can't he make his own food then? If you have a meal planned that works for everyone and all the accomodations and someone doesn't want to eat it they can make their own meal. That's just reasonable. What's unreasonable is getting mad at you for what you're making for dinner and not having any constructive criticism or not offering to do any work himself. I'm angry on your behalf. You don't need to let yourself be treated that way."
2081,"Girl, why TF does he get any say in what you're making for dinner? The only thing his spoiled ass should be saying is ""thanks for making dinner after working all day honey, I'll clean up and take care of getting the kids bathed and in bed."" Or maybe he should make dinner. Stop asking him what he wants! There's two choices, eat it or starve!

>He also thinks I should be working full time on chores on my off days, since technically I have off 6 days a pay period.

> he just doesn't get that I need some awake time where I'm not constantly being interrupted to figure out someone else's needs.

I once heard a wise woman say, when 2 people are working full time, that's when you get a housekeeper. It's not as expensive as you might think, and it's definitely cheaper than a divorce or a stay at the psych ward.

>It also irritates him that most nights after I work, I am shitty company. After getting all the things done, I try to go to bed by 8, because I have to wake up at 4am to get ready for work.

So he's mad that you need SLEEP?! 

It's time to stand up for Yourself. This dude is walking all over you and you're letting him. He'll never stop as long as you allow this behavior. And if you have children, your son is learning this is how women should be treated and your daughter is learning this is how men should treat her and she shouldn't expect any better. 

I'm telling you this as a 40 something woman who did the exact same shit for 21 years, until another woman came in and took my place in his heart. Now I'm left raising the kids, paying a crap ton of money to lawyers to make him face consequences for his behavior, and starting all over again. Learn from my mistakes, sister! I deserved better and so do you! You're doing amazing and valuable work with your residents and you deserve to have someone supportive, loving, and caring at home, not someone who's just sucking the life out of you and doesn't even appreciate what you do for his sorry ass!"
2082,"Hang in there. Once the ""missing them"" part is over, all the bad things will remind you why you're better off alone. 

There are people who respect you, out there. Hopefully you'll be lucky enough to find them :)"
2083,"Man here. I really appreciate this whole post (and I'm saving it for future reference). I wanted to get an opinion on something. I've *sorta* been learning in relationships is that acknowledgement takes precedence over solutions, is that the case here? Like, I'm definitely eager to do housework and have always done so, but that's not what this post is about. It's about recognizing my partner's burden first, and acting out of empathy rather than ""this outta fix your problem."" That's my understanding, I kinda butchered the explanation though. But am I on the rightish path?"
2084,"I think you may have misunderstood my comment. I'm not claiming it doesn't happen, I didn't claim women's standras are too high, and I certainly didn't say the blame belongs to women.

I'm saying that this very common occurrence is, in my experience, often wrongly down to ""men's fault"" when in fact I find it to be more of an issue of 2 people who notice different things. The comic immediately assumes men must want a manager, and I don't think that's a fair assumption to make. Do you?"
2085,[deleted]
2086,"I took the point to be not to treat your wife as the manager of household duties (or in larger context assume its something shes responsible for), and my point was I think its unfair to assume that's the case when someone asks if they can help.

And there's a big difference between acknowledging that we each notice different things to be done, and anticipating exactly how much work the other feels is necessary. I don't agree that not being a mind reader = petty. The house looks clean to me. I see nothing to be done, and yet my wife is busy doing something. I can stay quiet, or offer to help. To ask if I can take some of that load is exactly the consideration you're looking for. I think you're really far off calling me petty."
2087,"This is the last one I'll reply to:

I get the point. I respectfully disagree with the point. I thought your kitchen analogy is a perfect way to illustrate your point...and the rest of your post illustrates mine.

I cook. A lot actually, so does my wife.  Now that you've mentioned it I'm also the one that organizes our fridge and pantry...you know why???  My wife doesn't even see that they're disorganized. To her, the cold stuff goes here and the boxes go there IS organized. But as you said, it's hard to find stuff and we run out of room in the fridge when there's plenty of room left and I can never find anything unless I know exactly what I'm looking for, so I organize it.

Now how many people assume, as you did about me, that she must not care about the fridge or pantry at all???  They must be invisible to her? She must be making it my responsibility unfairly? They must not matter to her. She must not have given it any thought at all because she never uses them??? There must be a compromise issue that she's ignoring? She must think that because it ""doesn't matter to (her), so it just doesn't matter""???  You had no problem making all of these ridiculous assumptions about me...complete with shitty insult at the end. 

Is my wife a twat too?  Again, I specified that WE don't see some of the same things. She's less interested in our finances than I am, less interested in our technology as I am, less active towards our son's homework as I am...does that mean she must not care? They're invisible to her?  Of course not!  These are simply things that catch my attention before they catch hers. And when she does realize there's more effort going into these tasks than she thought, she offers to help and I'm happy to share the load.

I'm trying to respectfully and politely share another point of view for the same situation. I think it's an unfair assumption to claim that if a guy is offering to help, he MUST not care/not feel responsible/etc. just as I find the assumptions you've made about me to be wrong and unfair. It's fine to disagree, discussion is something I find the world needs much more of...don't be a bit of a twat about it. ;)

(and no, my wife is not some obsessive over-bearing extreme. We just notice different stuff. It really is that simple)"
2088,"Idk, tbh I don't remember my dad ever being this messy or other men that are older? For the most part that I've met. They seem more organized, cleaner? Maybe I'm crazy? But it's so exhausting to have to keep up with him that I'm so pissed the whole time cleaning instead of enjoying it, like I normally do"
2089,Exactly why I stopped doing it.
2090,Cook dinner for yourself. Shop for food only for yourself. Do your laundry but not his. Cleaning communal spaces can’t be helped but at a minimum you can reduce the workload for yourself. My mom had to do this with my dad and it really kicked him in the teeth when she was sat there eating dinner and he had no food to eat. He’s a ton better now (this was probably close to 20 years ago that she did this) so change is possible!
2091,Yeah I couldn't live with it when it became that bad. At some point we tried therapy and then called it quits because he literally said expecting him to do his own dishes was too much.
2092,My husband's tolerance for a messy house is much higher than mine.
2093,"> I wonder Ho many women in this thread say thank you instead of listing the ways their guy got it wrong. 

Let's flip it. Do you thank your wife for every chore or task related to childcare she does? Imagine if she never did anything like you say you do except for that one task, could you not understand that she's resentful? If you ask her to understand you (or rather us on her behalf) you should be able to put yourself in her position too. You guys are a team, she's not your mom, she's your partner.

Plus, housework and childcare are not a favour, it's your share of the work, your shared responsibility. It's not cool of her to unnecessarily criticize you and it'd be nice to be appreciated for it- but that's something you should be able to talk to her about. Not doing your share of the work because you've been criticized once is something I would have tried as a young teen to get out of my responsibilities- and it wouldn't have been tolerated. 

It's not a problem with you doing the chores, it seems to be a communication problem or resentment or whatever, you know best. Pouting and not doing childcare/ housework isn't a constructive solution to that problem, it's making it worse. I totally get why you're frustrated but sometimes you just have to get over those kinds of feelings because you're being a little immature."
2094,"While I appreciate it's no fun to be criticized, ""I'm not appreciated enough so I won't do anything"" is such a strange attitude in my view. You are not doing household chores as a favor to each other or to get a ""thank you,"" you are doing it to take care of the home you both live in and the children you share. It is about caretaking, nurturing, maintenance - not performance, competition, reward."
2095,"Did you not glance at the bottle before dumping cleaner into the bath? Do you not know the difference between the bottle of cleaner and the soap for your kids? ""Someone"" that you're implying wasn't you, has obviously been using these products. So either your kids clean more than you do or it's your wife. Buy her flowers, take her to a nice dinner. It sounds like she deserves it."
2096,"Well, not to excuse child like behavior like that, but communicating why before sending it may have helped. That’s more than a little passive aggressive. 

I think y’all are assuming that men behave rationally, or something. We are all emotional wrecks half the time, and he may have other shit under his skin as well."
2097,In any situation where there is one ranting/criticizing partner and one ignoring/distancing one I recommend [Hold me tight](https://books.google.de/books/about/Hold_Me_Tight.html?id=zDjCKtjP__4C&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y). Just this Google preview is explaining things enough to help imo

2099,"Yay, I'm glad you had a nice night despite having to stay in! A lot of times it doesn't really matter what you're doing as long as you get to do it together.

You can play a variety of more modern board games online for free too - check out tabletopia or boardgamearena (I'm sure there's other such services as well). 

And maybe try a co-op video game? My girlfriend and I are big fans of Overcooked (which has actually been really great since we had to go long distance over the last half year - it's one activity where the feeling of being together and working together to beat the level doesn't change much whether we're physically in the same room or not)."
2100,"
I've heard women's experiences where they seemed very well put together for the wooing period and then just let themselves go after they were in a relationship/married. Essentially they just stopped trying.

Or they're so amazing in other aspects so it feels like a small thing to complain about. 

Other times the women expect them to change after marriage/children and it's like...uh... obviously they're not going to do that if they're gotten away with it so far.

And both men and women can also be guilty of not sharing the mental load"
2101,"You would think, right? Except he never ever makes the first move, and only goes for women who chase him (and this is a noticeable pattern that the family has observed over the years). He's a good looking, extremely physically fit man, and the picture of traditional 'macho' masculinity which in a patriarchal culture (I'm South African) is valued by society. And the 'matching' women are kind of brought up to mould themselves into the meek, supportive, clingy trophy girlfriends (been there, done that too). Women just start fitting into the expectations he lays silently on the table. He's an expert manipulator; I don't think he even realises he does it. I've even caught him doing it to me! He does it to EVERY woman. One minute you're saying hello, haven't seen you in two years, next you're dropping everything to sort out his accounts, fetch his kids and take them to get a movie, making supper and get his washing off the line. It's a weird, weird psychological thing."
2102,"The best thing, if you really want to help with it, is to get yourself a notebook (or some other piece of writing paper), find a time when you both have free time and there's some laundry waiting to be done, and ask her to teach you what to pay attention to by telling you what rules she uses to sort it and then going together with you through the laundry pile so that you can try to help her and at the same time internalise the knowledge given to you by applying it.

Chances are that, even if you are trying to do the chores equally, she at some point assumed that you just wouldn't be interested in learning all of this and instead of nagging when she thought you not interested she decided to do it herself and deal with it. If this is true then she will like the fact that you really want to help out, even if the first few times will end up taking much more time. Alternatively, it may be because she doesn't want to gross you out with her own underwear, because sometimes you just have underwear that's seen blood and slime and all that, but if that is her issue with it then it just takes a discussion ... plus, if you have the time it's actually better to hand-wash underwear anyway, for the sake of the underwire (bras, plus some nightgowns) and the elastic (most everything) in it.

Also, not to preach but a lot of women's clothing isn't really that complicated, it seems so but it isn't. So yeah, it isn't right. I can understand if she wants to do the hand-washing bit on her own, as the overwhelming majority of things that you'd want to hand-wash are women's clothing and thus it doesn't feel right to ask a man to do it because ... well, if it's all my stuff then why have someone else do it for me? But just separating the clothes and setting the laundry machine and putting in the detergents (come to think of it, different clothing also requires different amounts of detergents, and in some cases different detergents altogether; I forgot to mention it in the previous comments because it felt so obvious to me), that's something anyone can do for as long as they care and have a reference sheet."
2103,"Thank you for defending me. :)

Why, tho, do you refuse to work with your spouse so he takes on more responsibility? I don’t see it as training so much as explicitly saying “Here’s what I’m in charge of and here’s what you are in charge of,” and then discussing expectations so you don’t end up with chicken nuggets every night. And that can be done at any time. We’ve adjusted our list of responsibilities many times over the course of our relationship, and I’m sure we’ll do it again."
2104,"I don't think they meant it as an insult (I could be wrong though!) I've had similar thoughts, as someone mentioned above, like -

Chore charts, reminders (and other methods) and having to explain details of basic, menial and (to women) quite obvious tasks that need doing is a lot like training a toddler/dog and not the behavior you would expect to have to model for a grown man."
2105,"Honestly you live like this because finding a man, in my own personal experience, that does not do this to some extent is nearly impossible it seems."
2106,"We all have to agree on it, but it depends on how much time/effort goes into the chore (and, with the understanding that it has to hurt a little to incentivize cleaning). For example, it’s $20 for a thorough tidying and sweeping of the kitchen/dining room along with wiping down the counters. It’s probably 30 minutes of work at most, but the point is for the assigned person to do it or deal with the financial consequence of inconveniencing someone else to have to do it."

It’s been especially rough with the quarantine since his job has had to close down for the time being and I’m working from home. He’s trying to find things to occupy his time with but he always pulls me into his projects once my workday is over and doesn’t get why I just want to relax."

It's not the men, that's sexist!"" dismissing all of this evidence of a pattern that men currently (and historically) have typically left management of the household and children to women and this is a problem in modern society where the woman also now works and is still expected to manage everything. We're all just out here trying to adult too and men partaking in this pattern isn't helping.

Perhaps maybe just read a few of these comments, talk (and listen!) to the women in your life about this, be open to hearing about different experiences and it might just surprise you how prevalent some of this stuff is."
2127,"I mean, I know you're just giving examples, but all the things you just listed are ones that really don't have to be done very often. When you compare that to something like the dishes or cooking or meal planning or grocery shopping, things that have to be done every day/week, it's easy to see why someone would feel like they are exhausted and need help with that vs something that only needs done on a monthly basis or even less."
2128,"Well you phrase this as if it’s not an issue for you, yet you complain about it in a reddit comment so it must bother you on some level. Have you tried telling her it bothers you?

If you think it really doesn’t, I don’t see the point of your comment. “My wife wants me to help with things that are mentally taxing for her, interesting that I don’t need her help on things that aren’t mentally taxing for me!”"
2129,"You can learn to notice the other things, if you really care about the person. I had a roommate who *hated* when others left hair on the floor, particularly in the bathroom. I never really noticed it because it didn't bother me. But after she had asked me once or twice to please make sure I cleaned up all my hair, I made it part of my routine to clean up the hair on the floor whenever I did my hair or saw there was a lot of it on the floor. After that, she never had to ask me again, because I put in the effort to make sure I noticed and dealt with this thing she cared about. Simple things like that shouldn't be hard for the vast majority of people.

You see nothing to be done, but there is probably still a pattern or a repeating set of things that your wife is doing when you ask to help. Think of it as a puzzle to figure out what those are - maybe those are things you could do without having to ask her."
2130,Sounds like hubby better grow up and deal with his issues or he ain't gonna be called hubby much longer.
2131,"I already do most of this. He will either order something or eat ramen or just make himself eggs or Not eat. at all.
It's not something that will be solved in that manner, unfortunately. 
And the communal spaces are all communal. This is our home, and he lives here too. We should both be making an effort to keep it tidy but I am often the only one putting in effort unless I specifically tell him to do something.... like about 17 times."
2132,"Sorry to hear. That's shit. 
Glad at least you got away from that though, it's pretty toxic honestly. Hope you're in a happier place now!"
2133,When I lived with my ex I tried going on strike like this with the dishes and they went  unwashed for over two weeks.  The water was putrid by the time I gave in and I actually ended up just throwing away a lot of stuff because of the mold and slime on them.  I was sure I was going to get sick from touching it.
2134,"Yep. My boyfriend isnt too horribly messy, but he has some things that he absolutely cannot understand why I care about them not being gross. Living alone he will neglect certain things for months at a time because he doesn't care how clean they are at all.  Showers, toilets, sheets, and carpets are the main things I just cannot convince him to care about at all.

Still, overall he would be fine living in a very unclean house and I would be miserable. ""Just stop doing it"" is only good advice if your partner actually cares about it being clean"
2135,"I can see that, I can also admit I'm spoiled in this regard. My husband cleans better than I do."
2136,"This is what it all boils down to. I think in most cases it’s not a situation where a man *expects* his wife or girlfriend to do housework, it’s that he genuinely doesn’t care if it gets done or not. It doesn’t affect his mood. 

Like how some people make you take your shoes off before walking on their carpet, and some people smoke indoors. Many men, left to their own devices, would not do a lot of these things at all. I mean, I don’t think I’ve ever written a greeting card. I don’t remember people’s birthdays. I can live on canned soup and bread without that affecting my self worth.

It’s all about finding someone who has the same standard of living, and accepting that there’s no “wrong” answer, only mismatched priorities."
2137,"So, there’s a difference between never saying thank you and always criticizing vs always saying thank you. But, I not only say thank you all the time, I thought our twins to say thank you by putting their hands together like this 🙏 before they could speak. 

I didn’t shit on my wife for putting the house cleaner next to the bubble bath because I don’t criticize her in front of the girls. 

But maybe I am being immature, you tell me about the last time my wife really got to me. I was at my suicide survivors group because Roger, Cathy, Duke, Pete (he was murdered so doesn’t really count), Kerry and Jason all killed themselves. Jason killed himself with fentanyl so not really a suicide but he was Rogers son and died at the same age. My wife texted me during my group to let me know she ran the battery down on her car. She was pissed when I got home because my phone was still off and got really pissed because I said I couldn’t deal with it that night. So, the next day I walked over and jumped it with the battery pack I told her she could use. So, was I just being a baby for taking me time to grieve and expecting a thank you when I got around to fixing my wife’s car?

It’s funny, at my suicide survivors group they treat me like a dog playing the piano because I’m the only cis man that’s ever participated. I guess I just need to man up and stop acting like a child."
2138,Being “an emotional wreck” doesn’t excuse you from behaving like an adult.
2139,I'm not sure asking for a proper meal means women have higher standards...
2140,"Edit : wrote an essay, you don't need an essay. In short-


Erm because I am deeply, deeply disorganised and struggling to look after the house myself. But also because I thought we would be a team and look after each other and I didn't expect to have to spell out on a daily basis what that means.

Which is a long way of saying - I don't want to live like that. I shouldn't have to explain what every single one of my needs is. It starts witha cleaning rota and it ends with having to schedule a hug into Google."
2141,I agree with you.  If our kitchen is filthy my partner can notice that and clean it.  If they’re not gonna do that I don’t think they’re going to do it just because it’s on a chart.
2142,"Ha, perhaps! The use of an expletive made me think otherwise but I guess it could have been meant as a neutral observance. I certainly joke about training my spouse, so it’s all in good fun.

In a perfect world I would agree with you about expectations. It would be nice if my partner took initiative on household chores, but he just doesn’t have it in him, so I can either complain about it or we can set up systems to help him be successful. Also, I use lists and charts for myself, too! They are so helpful so I don’t forget what to do or when I last cleaned something, etc."
2143,"i’d rather be single than deal with that 
i only have to worry about myself and my son 
not myself, my son, and some man who should be grown enough to be an adult on his own"
2144,Lol but when a man says something about the female gender yall wanna call him a misogynist. Aight then
2145,"Hmm, interesting 🤔 you have to make it sting!"
2146,"Well, you're not wrong."
2147,"Everything except the ""noticing when household items are low"", and even then it is only for essential items. If there is no mustard, there is no mustard and you will survive. 

If you can't have a functioning household without sending holidaycards then maybe the problem lies with you. 

Also I've never blamed or accused of not having a function household for not doing things like sending cards and not planning everything out."
2148,Mine too. It’s infuriating. Fortunately he realized pretty quickly that I’m not about that life.
2149,He has such an eas-IER life.
2150,I never said I was unhappy. I am not going to throw away a solid 14 year relationship because it isnt perfect.
2151,"I thought it was 25 hrs per week and yeah, that's believable."

2153,"""There are a whole lot of women here sharing their experiences of the mental load and you are here saying ""well I don't do that, so therefore it must be just a difference in noticing things! It's not the men, that's sexist!""

NO! THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING!!!

I don't disagree that this is a recurring problem that happens a lot

I don't disagree that it's often the result of sexist expectations on women

What I'm saying is: I think it's wrong to assume that if a guy is offering to help, it MUST be because he's sexist/clueless/figures it's woman's work... 

I'm not claiming that because it's not the case with me personally, it doesn't happen.  And if you've got studies or something that show 99% of guys feel this way, then I stand corrected.  But holy shit you've got a woman who drew a comic of an assumption of what guys think, and you've got an ACTUAL GUY here telling you what they think, and hooooooly shit the COMIC is being defended as correct. :P

Again, I'm not saying this situation doesn't happen. I'm not saying some guys aren't sexist, or lazy, or entitled, or clueless, or figure it's a woman's job to manage the house (maybe even subconsciously!)...but that's also not the default answer and to just ASSUME that it is, is wrong.  Really, REALLY surprised I'm getting so much pushback on that."
2154,Good point!
2155,"I think the difference is, culturally, most guys are told to ""suck it up"" and do it themselves, and they don't often seek help when they are stressed."
2156,We talked about his issues and told him that if he isn't going to responsible then I can't stay. It'll make me sick with constant worrying and I don't need that. So we'll see... I love him so much I never thought I would feel like this or say something like that to him.
2157,"Well, presumably you’ve had direct conversations with him about it where you laid out exactly what chores need to be done by whom and when, and he disagreed and or said “yeah sure!” but then didn’t do anything. From a behaviorist standpoint, the thing that’s missing here is consequences. A dirty house or no cooked meal is a negative consequence for you that you want to avoid, which motivates your behavior to clean and cook. (Or you’re rewarded by those things, or a combination of both). Your partner experiences no reward from a nice cooked meal or clean environment, nor does he appear to view the lack of either as a negative consequence to avoid. If you want to change his behavior (and that’s a big if—sometimes it’s easier and better to walk away), you need to introduce a consequence that actually has meaning for him. That is, if he agrees to a plan but doesn’t stick to it, something he likes gets taken away for X amount of time. To be honest, I would only do this if he agrees and can talk candidly about the problem he has—another commenter mentioned that he might have undiagnosed ADD or autism, and this kind of behaviorism is designed to address those disorders, but it’s not your job to behavior-train your partner unless he is also invested in it. If he refuses to even acknowledge a problem you’re probably best off re-evaluating the relationship as a whole."
2158,Sounds like he just doesn't care what he eats. So it's very probable that he didn't appreciate you cooking for him either and doesn't see a point in going through all the work to create a good meal.
2159,"If he can’t learn things like this, is it possible he’s got (undiagnosed) autism or ADD? You might get better advice from online groups dealing with adults on the spectrum, or a relationship counsellor that specializes in it... the hardest part may be to get him to acknowledge it’s a problem, and that you feel disrespected."
2160,"I'm sorry you had to experience the loss of so many people close to you, that must really be hard. I've only experiences a suicide attempt by someone close to me and that was traumatic enough so I can't imagine what it's like.

I don't want to meddle and play referee in your relationship, I know nothing about you. I just wanted to clarify that being criticized once for housework isn't a get out of jail free card to not do anything again and that women aren't to blame for men not doing their share of the housework because they're not nice enough about it. Sorry for wording it pretty harshly, I was super tired and pretty riled up from the horrible comments in the thread. I hope you can continue to go to that group, it sounds like a really supportive space. And I hope you guys can figure things out (or split if that's the goal). Maybe couples' therapy would help? It sounds like there's a lot of resentment on both sides."
2161,"So if I understand correctly, people in your therapy group have committed suicide and your wife did not allow you to grieve? (Or are you referencing something? I don’t understand listing all the names...) Why are you still with this woman?"
2162,Did I say it did? I think I made it fairly clear in the rest of the post.
2163,"Oh, that’s rough. I can see why you might have gone into things thinking you wouldn’t have to spell out expectations for your daily life and your needs — that’s what the movies tell us to believe! But in the vast majority of cases, you really do have to spell everything out.

I agree that you don’t want to take it to an extreme but if you do, you can always roll it back.

Scheduled hugs — sounds fun, honestly. Can’t ever have too many hugs!"
2164,"It doesn't sound like you want to be a team, but rather have someone care for ""every single one of your needs"".

Teams work together to decide on what their goals and responsibilities are, then decide who does what and how things need to get done. They don't just do things together and silently hope the other person knows what needs to get done and what they aren't doing. 

There's a reason why so many people say that good communication is the key to a healthy relationship. If you can't communicate what you want in your relationship then you shouldn't be in one."
2165,"I've considered ending it many times, and still wonder if I'd be better off single forever than dealing with this crap for the rest of my life."
2166,I said in my personal opinion based on my experience. I didn't say it was definitive or fact. This is MY experience. Doesn't make it any less true just because your experience is different.
2167,"I don't know what you're talking about, my household completely fell apart last year when I didn't replace the softener bottle that was still halfway full and forgot to send xmas cards to 4 people I haven't talked to in years.

There's, ""my husband sits on his ass while I do dishes and expects me to specifically ask for his help.""

And then there's, ""my husband didn't even notice the 3 specks of dust on the floor and I had to vacuum it myself for the 8th time this week."""
2168,Every year is slightly better. He was so messy in the beginning. Like hoarder level. He hid it really well and then when we moved in together BAM! Garbage everywhere. It’s a thousand times better now but still a work in progress. I was never a nagger before but now I have to think of ways to remind him to clean up after himself without being a bitch.
2169,"Those feelings of resentment are building up somewhere, and they're not without effect."
2170,Hi ginger girl 181. Am also ginger girl
2171,">But holy shit you've got a woman who drew a comic of an assumption of what guys think, and you've got an ACTUAL GUY here telling you what they think

I mean, I don't really know why you think you can speak for all men, they're not a monolithic unit. Lol you make it sound like the women in this sub should be grateful that you (as a man!) are here to bestow on us some sort of special insider knowledge of how men think.

Either way, you mentioned studies to prove this as you don't believe the women here: it's very easy to Google to find them but unfortunately this sort of systematic issue is extremely hard to study as it's in the private sphere and relies on qualitative data mostly so there are only a few; men also believe they're doing nothing wrong/women don't say anything and put up with it anyway. It's also not studied much as it is seen as a women's issue. Again you've got a serious amount of personal accounts that are accessable here or with a Google search. While you're there also search up on ""not all men"", you're coming across as seriously argumentative around this point."
2172,I completely understand.
2173,"Oh for sure. He has diagnosed ADD actually.
And while a cooked meal and clean house ARE rewards for him, he also doesn't care about mess, etc.

I've had direct conversations, and 'taking something away' from him sounds a whole hell of a lot like being his mother.

I appreciate you taking the time to type all this out, I think you're very right.

I really shouldn't have to behaviour train my grown ass adult partner at all, you're right. 

Thank you."
2174,"Half true-- He's just lazy. 
He very much appreciates the food I cook and when I make meals, but he just can't be bothered to be part of the solution in this situation."
2175,"He's been diagnosed with ADHD his entire life.
He does not medicate because most of the meds have some pretty negative side effects like not being able to sleep or have an appetite. 

thanks for the advice though, I'll spend some time looking into some online groups and see where that takes me!"
2176,"You're right, we're looking at more of a communication issue than anything else. It's something I need to think about."
2177,"there isn’t a single thing wrong with being single!!

2180,"We have been together for 14 years so trust me, I hit that point years ago. Its naive to think I wouldnt have by now. But I learnt thay resentment gets you nothing but a broken relationship and sometimes you can choose to no longer resent an aspect of your partner. I have accepted that he just doesn't see or feel about things to do with the mental load like I do. He does some stuff, but generally I still take most of it on. Its been ongoing since we moved in together 13 years ago. He does more now that we have 2 (nearly 3) kids but I still bear the brunt of it. So some things I now just accept, like I have had to accept that I have to specifically ask if I want help. He wont just see that I need it and if I push him about it, he gets defensive. But if thats his biggest flaw, then really, we are doing pretty good. 


It doesn't fit within the reddit narrative, but then again no one seems to have relationships that last longer than 5 or so years anymore."
2181,"Except that I never said high maintenance or nagging. Finding a man that does not expect a woman in some form to take on a lot the mental responsibilities, yes and I stand by it. I never used and adjectives that described a man to be anything unfavorable such as you with your ""nagging"" and ""high maintenance."" Fun fact - our truths are based on our experience and perspective. Considering every single man *I* have dated has left this load to me, it's fair for me to state that it's hard to find a man that doesn't. That's been my experience. You're welcome to have a different experience and opinion and guess what - both would be true. Let's not even start into the whole history where women have been oppressed. Don't be another man who continues to try to shut up women because we point out sexism when it's happening. Recognize it and do something about it. But your privilege is definitely showing."
2182,"But you literally generalize the entire male gender  based on your personal experience 💀 tf u mean ur pointing out sexism 😂

Look ik i look salty af rn but im just saying all this cuz its funny that women can trash on men but if a dude does it to females on twitter or whatever he gets shit on. Ik what u said isn’t true for every man."
2183,No one is trashing on men. Women are pointing out a problem. Learn the difference. If this post hurts your feeling feel free to leave at any time. It's a women's subreddit anyway.
2184,"Do you have some favorite self-care things you could do? Like a face mask, bubble bath, good smelling lotion, etc? I have body dysmorphia struggles too. It helps to make my body FEEL nice with nice sensory stuff ( good smells, self-massage, etc)"
2185,"I’m with you in that my face is my least favorite body part. A more flattering haircut really helped as it made my face look less round. I would also just try to try and start focusing on one or two things you like. Maybe you have some cute freckles? Or you brows look great? Nice teeth? Good jawline? Clear skin? One thing can be enough to start with.

Also like 30 min for a good face selfie is totally reasonable. Something about the angle just makes my face look weird."
2186,"Might sound silly but I find listening to music with that kinda ""l'm awesome"" vibe helps me. I mean I'm not rich but rapping to some song about money and cars makes me feel like a boss for 3 minutes sometimes."
2187,"Don't forget that selfies warp your face anyway, so what you see in a selfie isn't exactly you anyway. This really bugs some people and other don't even notice.  And you are worth a hell of a lot more than a stupid selfie."
2188,"hey girlie, i used to be so ashamed of my appearance and only wore baggy everything. the key to fixing it is to accept it. its your only body after all. 

and if your body is really skinny and flat, then i suggest you look at some models or people that embrace that from themselves.

and if you’re on the chubbier side, then go look at plus size models because they’ve been insecure once before and they’ve embraced it.

my motto is “if she can do it, so can i.” so go ahead and just say fuck you to the world and their beauty standards because you’re amazing and perfect in your own way!"
2189,I like doing skincare for my face but lately it hasnt been helping because my actual face is still the same. Also worried i might not be able to order my skincare after a while due to the virus stuff!
2190,"Thanks. Its not my body but mostly my face thats gross af. I never see ppl that look like me be considered beautiful, so ive resigned myself to my ugliness but its hard for me to take my mind off of it"
2191,"This is interesting and I agree with your perspective. As a lesbian I actually want to date like a straight women. My straight friends seem to go out 2-3 times a week on casual coffee/bar dates frequently. Lesbian dating seems to go from a few dates with one person to U-hauling before you know it. Also, lesbian fuckbois are a thing."
2192,"Am a bisexual woman. I think for women it's not about a lack of interest in casual sex. It's more that for women casual sex is disappointing. You put yourself in a position with a stranger who is likely stronger than you and ultimately you're less likely to actually get off from casual sex. For men they're pretty much guaranteed to get off from it so they get a lot more out of it.

I myself don't want a relationship but would like to have sexual experiences. But they're all just so damn dissapointing why would I bother with that??? I'm much more likely to have rewarding sexual experiences inside a relationship, even if it's not a serious one as I tend to lean towards open relationships."
2193,"It annoys me that men see sex as something we ""let"" them do to us, when I think most women see it as something we're doing together. There's still this stereotype that women don't like sex and we only do it to be nice to guys we like... I have never understood where it comes from. For example, I see guys on Twitter all time say ""she let me hit"" or something similar."
2194,"Isn't there also a safety thing for straight women that should be considered? Like I'm down for hookups, but also not trying to get murdered or raped if the vibe is off. Any hookup situation can be dangerous (gay, straight, etc), but the danger for women is a bit higher, no?"
2195,See my experience on wlw bumble is that sure there’s a lot of women looking for relationships but there’s just as many looking to hook up. Not sure if that’s many other people’s experience though. A lot of it seems to be girls who are experimenting/girls in relationships who’ve been given permission to do so on the side
2196,"I think it varies person to person. I have a many girl friends who want nothing more than sex. I have one friend in particular where her count is over 50 people. 

My best friend is gay and he's a total romantic looking for Mr right. I don't think he's ever had a one night stand. 

And there are plenty of straight men who think one night stands are gross. I have met some men who are totally love sick and commitment driven that it makes me sick.

Everyone is different, I think dating apps make it seem like there's a lot more perverted men out there because those type of people are more likely to use it. If you message 100 people your junk eventually someone's going to respond and if they don't it doesn't matter, its low stakes. It's a lot harsher to be rejected in person than over a phone."
2197,"I see what you're saying, but it's important to remember that your sample is people who use apps like tindr and grindr. The hook-up-relationship culture is way different in other forms of dating."
2198,"That’s a really interesting perspective and I agree with you. Dating for me was a nightmare, there are so many men out there with bad intentions. Wanting to have casual sex is one thing, but being dishonest, leading a girl on and manipulating her just to get it is borderline rapey tbh. We really are different in so many ways and casual sex fucking sucks for a lot of us (and this is coming from someone who used to do it). Think about it:



Men don’t really have to worry about too many consequences from casual sex, pretty much a disease at most. However, women have more of a chance of catching a disease (and it going unnoticed), rape/assault (men can get raped too, but it’s astronomically higher for men to rape women), PREGNANCY/abortion, shame, pain, etc. too many dudes just don’t realize/care about these things."
2199,"I can agree with it being a bit of a bleak scene. I am a single female who has been single for years. I have found that sleeping around doesn't do it for me, as I crave emotional intimacy. 

It's all about connection. I have fooled around before and reserve the right to if I feel like it bc if I didn't, I never would have 69'd that hot norwegian man on the balcony of a metal cruise while listening to venom playing live... *sigh... Good times. Being open to adventure is the best way to live! 

Sex is great, flings can be fun, women want sex just as much as men in my own personal experience. I just don't crave that as much as I do making love to one man who truly sees me and cherishes what we have. It can also be really frustrating bc it doesn't make you any less horny. 

I don't lose hope because I have seen examples of really great guys finding my best girlfriends who have previously had a lifetime of fuckboys wasting their time. They are really happy now and I have alot of respect for their men. I remain hopeful that I will find that for myself and you too op."
2200,"Many gay men do not embrace the culture of grindr. It's not a dating app, it's a meet up app. I think the assumption that all gay men want is sex is totally off-base. Just like the assumption that all men want is sex and women don't is not going to be inherently true. That might be what popular culture is telling is these days, but I know many women-straight and gay-that just want to fuck, and many men who do not. 

There is such diversity in the human experience, especially within queer and trans communities, that it is impossible to divvy up who wants what based on who they are attracted to.

There's also a huge population of people that to not use dating apps at all, and their preferences also fall along this spectrum. In the end, trying to cut up any sort of human behavior into a strict binary of this or that is ineffective and untrue. Where there are generalizations, there are grey areas."
2201,Well grindr is specifically for sex not relationships
2202,may be due to the idea that homosexual people cant sleep with people as easily irl cus ur assumed as heterosexual
2203,"I think you shouldn't put so much stock in these generalizations. Grindr, as the name indicates, isn't exactly the place one goes to for deep conversations. Tinder is also very popular for hookups, for both straight and queer people. In my own circle of friends, I find that the balance between those looking for a meaningful connection and those who like to hook-up is pretty even, when it comes to both men and women, straight or queer.

The idea that men in general aren't looking for anything serious is misguided, in my opinion. Like, sure, culturally we have taught men that sex is something to brag about, that if you're a virgin adult you're a loser, blah blah blah. We teach women that sex is something to be ashamed of, that it devalues her. I'm sure that BS still carries over into real life. But in general, I believe people want the same things. In my experience, people want the same things, in the end. Like sure, hookups are fun for some people, but in the end, we want to be close to someone in more ways than just physical closeness."
2204,"Maybe it just comes down to the fact that women are at a unique risk of getting pregnant. Gay men and women don’t have that issue. Women have to be extra cautious because when it comes down to it, there’s nothing really keeping a man from committing to having a baby because he could always leave if he wants to. Women have to bear the risk of getting pregnant if they don’t want to and men can have casual sex without it changing their lives in a dramatic way."
2205,"Well, there is an old joke...

> What does a lesbian bring to a second date?
>> A U-haul

I have read and had a lot of second-hand experience same-sex relationships (many of my very best friends are queer, several of them were my roommates). With men, there can easily be lots of NSA sex, for women there is lots of conversation and processing. 

My biggest frustration when dating was that I felt girls were raised to believe a lot of the old social norms of dating and relationships were out-moded, but it seems the guys didn't get the same memo. I found it was hard to date with an egalitarian state of mind and have a ""real"" stable relationships. I found being sex-positive, assertive, and not role-playing got me a lot of admiring fuck buddies, but they just didn't take me seriously as girlfriend option. (I did find someone eventually, but that's another story and I never figured out how to pick that lock.)

I also think there is an imbalance in how men and women think of dating in that when a woman says yes to a date she has already vetted the guy to some extent to be a good one, whereas for men it's more of a numbers game. As a result, women are often already emotionally invested more than men almost from the beginning. This makes men seem like flakes and users, when they really just didn't start in the same place.

However, I honestly think that - underneath all the shallow introductions, horn-dogging, and lip service to not wanting ""commitments"" - in the end, men are no different than women and do want love and companionship. Ironically, I think men rely much more on their female partners as a sole source of love and support than women do, they actually need it more."
2206,"Straight woman here. I only used dating apps to find hookups; my previous and current LTRs grew out of hookups that I didn't meet online. I'm not sure that I agree that men want hookups and women want relationships - that's too broad a brush. In fact, my current partner asked me to be monogamous (and I honestly had to think hard about whether to give up my amazing sex life).

There are some men I'm content to fuck just for fun and others who are interesting to me on multiple levels that I would date. I think that's how it is for most people, actually, whether they admit it or not. And I truly believe that if you're only dating to find a commitment, you're going to be very unhappy for most of your experience. Be open to whatever level of connection you find with people - even if it's purely sex, or even if it's none. There are 8 billion humans in this world; you're not going to react to all of them in the same way."
2207,"A lot of gay guys are looking for something longterm, and are frustrated with the hook-up culture that is common on dating apps.

A lot of straight guys are also looking for something longterm, and wouldn't want to casually hook up with somebody.

I'm seeing some generalizations here that seem a little sexist..."
2208,"Personally, this mismatch troubles me greatly. I don't do casual sex. I don't like it, it's not fulfilling or enjoyable, and I can't get excited about a stranger. I need to know and trust someone before wanting to have sex with them - otherwise, how will I know if I'm safe? How will I ensure I'm not being used and tossed? It's dehumanizing.

I'm almost at the point where I accept that I won't be able to find the kind of man I want, because I want someone who prefers to be familiar before having sex, is looking for a genuine connection, trustworthy, etc. And those qualities seem really fucking rare as far as straight men are concerned. 

It doesn't make me angry or bitter. Just really, really sad. Dating is very demoralising because if you aren't willing to fuck after the second date, you get ghosted... and I am so discouraged by how incredibly common that attitude is. 

I'm just ranting. I don't think there is a solution. I want to bond. I don't want to fuck. Once I bond, the sex gets amazing, but it takes time to establish trust and respect... and it's been 5 years since I last met a man who was willing to stick around."
2209,"I think it just comes down to personal preference and not gender or sexuality. I think pointing to gender and sexuality to explain this differing in behavior has the chance to cross over into sexist / bigoted territory by accident.

I’m (31F) married now but when I was single I wanted to sleep with someone before I started dating them to ensure we were sexually compatible before I started developing feelings for him. I personally think anyone who doesn’t do that and enjoys sex (obviously sex isn’t important to everyone) is insane and setting themselves up for potential disappointment. 

I also casually slept around A LOT because I like sex and I don’t think you need to be in a committed relationship to get to enjoy sexual. I often experienced men who weren’t able to understand a woman who just wanted casual sex, who would get angry and jealous and possessive because they figured I was just trying to play it cool. Attitudes like “straight women aren’t looking for casual hook ups” are the reason these men wouldn’t believe me when I was honest with them about what I wanted and why they could become inappropriate after realising I was serious.

ETA: hubby and I have been together for 6 years now and I’ve never used dating apps, so my comments are from in-person experiences which may not be relevant when talking about dating apps"
2210,"These are trends but they don't hold for everyone. Women can love casual sex too and some men are very oriented towards monogamy and commitment and romance. Personally, hooking up is too hard on tinder for my tastes because there's no time aspect to posts and you can't see who is looking for something immediate. I like an even easier hookup environment. I used to post on Craigslist and could be having sex with an attractive guy within half an hour, but I moved to a more rural area and now the pickings are slim and the casual encounters section of Craigslist got shut down anyways when the laws changed.

My biggest problem is that guys don't care to even try to understand what interests and excites women. Our thoughts are completely unimportant to them and that often applies both in and out of the bedroom. It's not simply a dating problem, it's pervasive in all types of interactions."
2211,"As a bi girl who dates both, straights have it easy. As a woman dating women, compared to dating men, it's ridiculous how much harder it is. Teeny tiny dating pool. We all flake on each other all the time,  no one wants to make the first move, everyone is so picky.  The straights and gay guys have it easy. That's my two cents lol"
2212,I’ve noticed this before and felt that trend in gay dating where many are sex-crazy relates to how its just how many men are ‘naturally’. Of course not all but a noticeable amount. It does bother me when trying to meet someone how literally every guy leads the conversation down the sexual lane way too early for my comfort. Call me whatever u want but it makes me uncomfortable and feel used and less liked.
2213,Wow this post reinforces how thankful I am to be gay lmao. lesbians are just chilling with each other while straight couples are at each other’s throats lolol
2214,It's your age too though. This will change
2215,"Studies about men’s arousal patterns (gay as well as straight) have repeatedly emphasised on sensitivity of visual cues. They also seem to have a greater reward system as compared to women when it comes to sex.

I think, the culture and their natural tendency to be dominant with high testosterone levels also motivate them to pursue intimacy without having to do the work required for a relationship of any kind. They also get to be “independent”, “not having to deal with things” that way, which is alright as long as it is __a consciously chosen way of life.__ Whereas, we, women mostly crave a connection and need to be turned on on a psychological level."
2216,"This video sums up what you are saying: https://youtu.be/j3kyeOUrdS4

To be honest, I'm trying to understand male characteristics, and while some of those traits are very toxic (like the male obsession with sex), the obsession with relationships women have also is toxic.

Answering you: it does bother me because it shows so clear how divided we are. We need balance

I don't like to judge which one is better or worse, they are different and we should understand both to be complete, not slaves of pursuing relationships or sex."
2217,"Hahaha... I do love that joke, ""What does a lesbian bring to the second date? A U-Haul."""
2218,"i think the idea is that for gay people, things are much more likely to be mutual. It seems like most gay guys are fuckboys, but when two fuckboys get together they're both happy and no one is hurt. So I don't shame gay guys for having a huge casual sex culture.

Lesbians want to have actual dates which is also fine, since it's mutual as well.

Things become far from mutual when you combine straight guys who wants to just have sex and a straight girls who wants actual romantic relationships."
2219,">lesbian fuckbois are a thing.

You means Shanes?"
2220,All my knowledge of lesbian culture comes from @godimsuchadyke on ig and this checks out.
2221,Hey same. I’m over the lesbian Uhauling thing and would rather just date normally.
2222,"Agreed. Additionally, even when looking for hookups, I don't want to fuck a creep and some light screening goes a long way. I need more than a hot body to be turned on."
2223,"This. Casual sex was always super disappointing for me when I was in college, and the danger aspect is huge."
2224,"> Am a bisexual woman. I think for women it's not about a lack of interest in casual sex. It's more that for women casual sex is disappointing.

Very much this, I agree. I'm bisexual too (though heteroromantic), and I don't mind casual hook-ups as a thing but it's very hard for me to feel comfortable with someone whom I don't know enough to at least be friends with and this makes any sexual encounter with them unlikely to give me much pleasure if any at all. This means that even if I don't need a long-term serious relationship with someone, if I want to have sex with a guy (or a gal, yes) and get any pleasure from it I have to meet with them first, talk for a bit, learn something about each other at least on the basic level, have fun with each other, and only then there's any point in me having sex with them."
2225,[deleted]
2226,"> There's still this stereotype that women don't like sex and we only do it to be nice to guys we like... I have never understood where it comes from.

It probably comes from a history of sex only being acceptable to society if it's in the confines of monogamous, married relationship.  And also that sex is much more of a risk to the woman than the man, on a few fronts - pregnancy, violence, and until the last few decades, social stigma.  Combine that with a history of men not really giving a shit about women's consent, or pleasure, it's not so hard to see where women don't find ""just sex"" nearly as appealing as men do."
2227,That’s absolutely the reason in my case. That and pregnancy risk.
2228,"For real.  Anyone can be a psycho with a weapon, but if I had to be fighting off someone bent on sexual assault, a man is a bigger threat."
2229,"Lots of women looking to hook up, lots of couples using a female profile (often without mentioning a man at all) looking for a unicorn, lots of women in a relationship that are just looking for fun for herself (though maybe the guy wants to watch), lots of women wanting to ""just look"" to see what's out there, lots of bi women that say they're interested but only date straight, lots of women looking for female friends in dating spaces (ie, bumble date instead of bff), lots of men ""accidentally"" creating female accounts either because they're pathetic and can't find a straight woman or have a ""conquer a lesbian and turn her straight"" ego problem, etc.

As a femme interested in finding another femme to spend the rest of my life with, I find that I talk to a small handful of women per year, 90% of whom end up falling into one of those categories above... and I find that a lot of us looking for a serious LTR have simply given up because the wlw spaces are dominated by the above. In the end, I may go on a date with 1-2 women per year and a lot of them end up just not being a good fit (but we tried anyway because of the above problems) or they're emotionally unavailable.

Out in the real world, I continuously get mistaken for straight (because a pretty, femme girl HAS to be into guys) even though I sport some lesbian flair and I'll admit I make the same assumption about other femme girls unless they're sporting visible flair too. Given that we tend to be rather timid about asking someone we like out, it can be really tough to find someone, making those online spaces that much more important, but that much more intolerable given the above problems."
2230,">A lot of it seems to be girls who are experimenting/girls in relationships who’ve been given permission to do so on the side

In my jaded opinion the ven diagram of the wlw who want hook ups and those in the quote above are a circle or near to it."
2231,"Agreed but maybe that's because it's the lived experienced for the overwhelming majority of women ...? 

Or, at least, the women that happen to be here."
2232,"Honestly, if you were a lesbian, we would have been a great match. I feel exactly the same. I don't know how people do one night stands! I second this: ""  I want to bond. I don't want to fuck. """

2237,"No hate to people in open relationships, I believe in polyamory. But it was more just my own personal experience"
2238,"Yeah I was gonna chime in with something about this. Even when I was going through my hoe phase, safety was still at the forefront of my mind. As much as I didn't wanna date anyone I was never quick to go home with strangers and things just kinda fizzled out a lot early on when all I needed was 1 to 2 dates for reassurance that I wouldn't be raped/murdered/mistreated."
2239,That makes a lot of sense.
2240,"Girl I related to this comment so much!! I usually use dating apps to meet women cause I also get mistaken as straight all the time haha.

Last time I tried I had several disappointing experiences- first a girl and I talked for a bit, and then she invited me to dinner that night with her and “the guy she’s been seeing”; of course, this guy hadn’t been mentioned anywhere on her profile or earlier in our convo. After I said no she said they were looking for a threesome (were they just going to spring that on me at dinner?)

Then, I was starting to feel a connection to the girl that I had talked to the most on the app and was getting excited about it... until I asked her “are you out at your church?” And she said, “what do you mean out?” My heart sank a bit and I texted back “out as gay” and then she told me “oh I wouldn’t say I’m gay, I don’t even know if I like women.” This was so frustrating cause way earlier in our long conversations I had asked what she was looking for and she said “down for anything”! That would’ve been the perfect time to mention that she was experimenting 😅 after that whole experience I gave up on wlw apps for a while haha"
2241,"I think you perfectly sum up lesbian dating. Unless your willing to lower your standards or date outside your type the numbers are just not there. I would image it being a bit easier in a major city like London, NYC, Paris etc. but I bet it’s still a bit of a nightmare."
2242,"Out of sheer curiousity, what counts as ""lesbian flair?"""
2243,"> With such technology you'll see a more gay guys and a lot more lesbians.

Have you looked at the world?  You will see gay and lesbian people forced into conversions all across the world."
2244,"There's a stereotype/joke that lesbians move in together very quickly after they start dating, so the joke is that you bring a U-Haul to move all your belongings after only the first date."
2245,"Two Sundays, I got a message from a super cute girl that looked promising... until she jumped into ""nice shoes, wanna fuck?"" mode. I told her I had some demi tendencies and I can't do casual sex since I need an emotional connection before I'm willing to go there. She got quiet and disappeared for a few days.

Friday night, she messages me a little after midnight since she can't fall asleep. Starts hitting me up for sex again and tells me her husband is a weak, pathetic man that doesn't do it for her. I reiterate that I do not do casual sex and that I'm monogamous, put 100% of myself into a relationship and need that in return from someone, and I'm looking for someone to spend the rest of my life with, not looking to be someone's toy while she's in a relationship with someone else. This isn't a surprise, it's right in my profile (and there was nothing in her profile about being married, only looking for casual sex, etc)... At least she promptly unmatched me at that point without a reply.

Some favorites from the past:

a married woman (at least it was in her profile) that messaged me on another app that was interested in me. I told her I'm monogamous and not looking to be a unicorn and she replied ""so am I,"" to which I pointed out that her profile says she has a man she wants to share, and she replied ""That is correct, but that can still be monogamous, just the 3 of us, and I'm not talking about threesomes. We are more focused on the relationship."" Hello, do you understand the definition of words?

a guy with a female account that says he accidentally clicked female. I pointed out that he was lying since he put his name in as Marsha (and this isn't a trans person early in their transition, this is a straight up dude presenting as a dude, just lying to get into wlw spaces because he's pathetic).

A bi girl that I've been off and on with for the last year who really seems interested in me but can't shake the stigma of being with a girl and dates guys because ""they're easy - there's no emotional connection and if you get into an argument, you give them a bj and he shuts up."" She's actually my dream girl and that's why I haven't given up completely, but a lot of it comes down to her being terrified of being emotionally honest with herself and opening up to the feelings that she's intentionally avoiding. She won't ever talk about it, but I get the sense she wants to be with me, but admitting it exposes her emotional vulnerability, so to keep herself numb, I think she dates guys for a few weeks and then returns back to me in between. It's absolutely not fair to me and I've called her out many times over it, but there's a pattern of her disappearing for a few weeks, me giving up again, and then 4-6 weeks later, her popping up back into my life. Funny part is, we shared an immediate strong emotional connection (which is probably what scared her) and I would have been interested in sex fairly quickly, but after a year of these games, I'm mostly just hurt right now and wondering what is real, what excuses I'm making up in my head for her because I like her so much, etc.

On one hand, I'm still somewhat attached to her, or rather the possibility of her, but on the other, I'm still looking and keeping myself emotionally available because it's been a year and she can't seem to break the cycle. I regularly get disgusted with the whole thing though and will give up on dating for weeks/months at a time because the wlw space is so dysfunctional given all the bigger problems I mentioned in my last post. Eventually, the loneliness and desire to be with someone grows enough that I overlook all the problems and try again, often to immediately find that everyone still sucks."

I am in a somewhat similar situation. I get to work from home, but 95% of the people in my company with the same employee classification are not working and they are being paid their full salary. They get at least two paid weeks off that won’t affect PTO or anything else, whereas if I want a day off during this time I have to use PTO. 


When I have downtime, I make lists of thing I would like to do and as soon as I log off I start doing them. 


Sitting at home on my laptop, I am looking around and seeing so many things I would love to do instead of waiting for someone to respond to an email. It’s frustrating, but at least I am essential for the time being.

2253,"Hi Gracie_lou558, 

I know it is going to be very tough during this time to keep working while seeing your friends do fun stuff. It might be best to avoid social media while working and plan for something that you consider fun and rewarding outside of work. Or if you're feeling left out, invite your friends to do something fun after work - agree to start a movie at the same time and video chat about it, play a game together, talk a walk and call a friend. Try to also change how you're thinking about the situation. 

Earlier this week, I was chatting with my roommate about being stuck at home and they corrected me. We are choosing to stay home. That gave us back the power and we didn't feel so overwhelmed. Also, separating when I was on social media helped too. It doesn't feel like I'm stuck working while my friends are having all of the fun. They are having challenges too. Remember that people often advertise/talk about the fun and great things on social media, they don't always show the hard times and struggling."
2254,"I’m sure the people you think are having fun are just as anxious as you. All the cleaning/reorganizing/other fun things you see people doing are often part of their coping - it’s an activity that allows them to feel in control of something, which is something a lot of people want to feel right now when basically everything else is up in the air with the pandemic. 

I think everyone right now is just trying to make the best of the situation they’re in, whatever that looks like - whether or not that means they’re working from home, still needing to physically go to work, or have been laid off. There really isn’t anything else you can do."
2255,That’s terrible! I would throw a fit if there was nothing distinguishing your duties from those of the people who are getting free vacation right now. That is not fair in the least.

So basically 4 years with one , 3 with another and 10 with my last, with 2 non serious guys in the mix. I'd estimate I've been single less then a year since I was 16.

So on any normal day, I guess I give off that cute and innocent vibe? I also work in a very male dominated field. On the days I need to be taken more seriously (presentations and such), I darken the makeup, pin the hair up in a chignon or something else similarly professional, and wear darker colors and more polished silhouettes (like pencil skirts or slacks). In my experience I get listened to and taken more seriously this way, but it doesn’t feel like me so I just deal with it otherwise"

I'm chubby, I don't have great cheekbones or an enviable jawline, and I still think it was flattering. It took about 6 months to grow out a short pixie and I wore a lot of beanies for that period.

I would say go for it! But I didn't have to worry about presenting as a ""professional,"" so I can't speak to that (frankly bullshit) standard.

If your DIY pixie doesn't work out, you can always go shorter! Good luck <3"
2297,"Farthest I've gone is a Chelsea (keep the bangs, buzz everything else short). Even then I kept it like an inch long. My mom lost her hair to cancer and said ""I REFUSE FOR THERE TO BE TWO BALD WOMEN IN THE FAMILY!"""
2298,"Are you open to accessories like wigs, hats and scarves? In case you don’t like the results?

I did it a couple years ago. It was really liberating but also...humbling. 

Also the growing back process takes patience. 

I say go for it if you need a change. It’s an interesting experience."
2299,"I had a buzzed head for three years!! Only just starting to grow it out...
Message me if you want to see pics, as I’m a UK 16 so was worried about being too big as well/chubby chins but I loved it!"
2300,"I did buzzed for Halloween last year. I was a grad student though so professional-ism wasn’t a big deal. I liked it but my regular cut suits me better- shaved sides with a couple inches of length on top.
That being said I’ve seen girls with some extra weight absolutely slay the style, so I would say that’s not a problem."
2301,This was part of my thought process- although Zoom meetings are stopping me living in pyjamas!
2302,"Same- some fuzz, not shiny! My partner is cool with it. I'm not sure my bosses would be though!"
2303,"Wow, you look stunning with it buzzed! 

It is all bullshit, but I'm always torn between rebellion and compliance (the latter pays my rent!)."
2304,"Even though I'm nearly 40, my mum will probably kick my ass if I do this! I am contemplating the inch long thing as a compromise becauseI think it will shock bosses/colleagues less. I hope your mom is okay."
2305,"I would describe myself as open but clueless! 

That's really interesting- can I ask how you found it humbling?"
2306,"Chubby chins were my big fear, which is crazy given that my chin(s) are always there regardless of my hair length!"
2307,"Awesome! I'll be honest, I didn't think I could pull off short hair. Since hacking it off last night, I'm feeling cute as hell this morning!"
2308,"You'd have to warn them! When I was training to work in health our course director warned us not to shave our heads - he'd had a student do that and she was rejected from a work placement because the patients complained it made them uncomfortable.

Remember those pics of Britney shaving her head?  So tempting but know I would suffer immediate regret. I should get it done professionally, have some style put in."
2309,"Thanks! And yeah, fun as it was, definitely not worth losing one's livelihood over."
2310,"It made me realize how vain I was about my hair and it feminizing me. So I felt less beautiful and less feminine at times. For example if I was having a low self esteem day, didn’t wear makeup or jewelry I’d be more likely to feel ugly/masculine."
2311,"That’s great, I bet you are cute as hell!"
2312,It's so weird that men can do it but women can't!
2313,"I know what you mean. That was 10 years ago, we're getting there slowly, thank god for the women who dare to go for it :)

What'll it take to get you there? Do you have thick hair and could go for some sort of half and half?"
2314,I'm going to do a diy pixie cut. Test the waters!
2315,Exciting!!!
2316,"So the great cut has begun! It was down below my bra strap, now the longest bits are a few inches! I love it so far :)"
2317,"Brilliant! I bet it feels amazing, big hugs X"
2318,And to you! You're awesome :) x
2319,"It's funny that I see this post today, because this morning a homeless man followed me to the bus stop to ask me for oral sex (I live in LA). That was in jeans with a long sleeve flannel over my shirt - trust me that there's nothing you could wear that would prevent disgusting people from being disgusting."
2320,"Lovely how they can still do their best to reduce you to a piece of meat, then get you to blame \*yourself\* for both inviting it and taking it badly, isn't it? You didn't do anything wrong, you did not invite this. It's the sea of misogyny we swim in."
2321,"What I find most helpful is to lean into the anger and righteous feelings. How dare they make YOU uncomfortable?? Call them out! ""That is creepy."" ""You are being gross and making me uncomfortable."" ""I'm not an object you sicko."" ""Dude what the fuck?"" ""How would you feel if someone said that to your mother?"" Lean into the angry feeling instead of the guilt. The guilt makes you feel like YOU did something, when you did not. It makes you act more cautiously and delicately so you don't hurt their feelings. Well, guess what? They're hurting your feelings right now! So why be nice?! Why be polite? Just be honest and brutal right back at them. 

Eventually, in my experience this anger starts to fade out, and gets replaced with confidence and certainty. And you KNOW in your heart of hearts with 100% certainty that you are not the one in the wrong. You were not provocative. You didn't ask for it by existing in the world and trying to interact. You just have to literally train yourself out of all the internalized societal bullshit, and get that inner voice a bullhorn for awhile til it is loud enough on it's own.


Edit: PS. I just checked out your post and holy crapola girl!! That is some progress!! You're looking fantastic and you should be super proud. On the topic of the post, fuck anyone who tried to make that sexual. (Or, ah, don't fuck them- they can go to hell instead!)"
2322,"Sorry to hear this, you can only look after your own honour in this world, its hard to not let others negatively influence you I know, you just have to let it all wash over you without a care for what all these donks on the internet think.

Keep going with what you're doing, you're making good progress and should be proud of yourself."
2323,"i get the worst catcalling when im not in makeup and in an XL sweatshirt and sweatpants. it doesn't matter what you're wearing (nor should it in the first place). i wish i could tell you to brush it off and not think about it but i know that's a lot easier said than done. what i can say is that no matter what you say or do, you're not ""asking for it"" and you *definitely* don't deserve the unsolicited comments. as for progress pics, maybe check out r/xxfitness if you want to continue posting and gaining motivation- i find it's a much more comfortable environment! wishing you all the best and i hope you're feeling better :)"
2324,"Ugh I hate this too!! As a fellow large boobed lady, I dislike how much they make people perceive me more sexually against my will :( I often feel like less curvy women are able to get away with more in terms of dressing and style without being over sexualised to the same extent. Bleh.

However, I saw your progress pics and you're doing so incredibly well and you should be extremely proud! I hope the positive feedback you receive can drown out the creepers ❤️"
2325,"They do it deliberately.  It's about power.  Catcalling and harrassment are a tools of the patriarchy to keep women cowed and subservient. Furthermore women are required to *be* pretty or sexy, but they are not allowed to *feel* pretty or sexy.  Their inherent beauty or sexiness is solely for the enjoyment of men.  Women are not permitted that same enjoyment.  And god forbid they use that sexiness for their own gain or monetary enrichment.  Absolutely not.  Women who do that must be shamed and put back in their place."
2326,"Dont feel bad. Some people are pigs. 

I had some dumb drunk guy call me a slut at an NFL game. It was 30F out and I was wearing snow pants, a winter coat, gloves, a neck warmer, and a winter hat. 😂

My boyfriend heard and grabbed the hat right off of his head and threw it across the stadium like a frisbee. 

See? Some people are twats. Others are not."
2327,Totally not your fault! Some people will be creeps even if you're modestly dressed. There are a lot of people who know to be respectful and not view you in a sexual way while some people are the opposite and seem to lack social etiquette. They will pretty much take whatever they can get even if the rejection is super high. My first time being approached by a creep was when I was 12 and it grossed me out but I didn't blame myself. I was mad at that man for being disgusting.
2328,"I feel the same, and I hate it. I don’t think anything if “normal” situations, like a guy trying to hit on me. But when it’s something more sexualized... I feel so ashamed. Like I can’t believe I let myself get into the situation. Like I should have prevented it. Like I should have stopped him. Like I’m the one to blame. I feel so dirty for being looked at with undesired eyes, or lusted after by someone who only sees me as something to put their dick in. I feel so at fault, when all I did was walk."
2329,"I’ve been sexually harassed in the dead of Chicago winter, fully geared up with bulky layers and only parts of my face showing. What you’re wearing or how you’re behaving really doesn’t matter to desperate, disgusting people whose goals are to make you uncomfortable, assert power over you, or take sexual urges out on random strangers. Keep doing what you’re doing and just ignore it the best you can. A lot of times they just want a reaction."
2330,"Same but I’ve gotten to the point where I’m like they are so stupid. Ive had guys look at me and whisper rather loudly “She definitely a hoe” in response to me walking from the parking lot to a chili’s in highwaisted shorts in 98 degree weather. I just think. “I’m a Virgin. No sex drive. I wouldn’t touch if your life depended on it, sweaty”"
2331,"Don't be ashamed of your body. Not in work out clothes, not in a swimsuit, or any public place that you chose to show yourself off.

Men are disgusting, and these comments that are being made to you and make you feel badly are likely being said for shock. 

 I let my brother make me feel ashamed of my body, and it took longer than I'd like to admit to not feel like I needed to hide it, or feel that my DD boobs were vulgar at any and every moment of the day. I still dress modest, but now that I workout and run regularly, I've also found a new confidence and show myself off more 

Take stock in the comments here, know that we've all experienced something similar as you and to not let it bother you another minute longer. You got this girl."
2332,"Creepers gonna creep no matter what.  They're assholes and misogynists. That's what they do.

You could be:

Underage

Of age

Older

Scantily clad

Naked

Fully clothed

Dressed provatively

Dressed like a tom boy

Dressed in oversized clothes

Look like a nun/wear a habit

Wear a hijab

Wear a niqab

Wear a burka

Wear makeup and do your hair and nails

Wear no makeup and have messy hair


It doesn't matter. It's them not you. They're being diarescpectful. You're just trying to exist."
2333,"Just about everything in human history and human culture (especially nuclear family as opposed to tribal culture) has been designed around blaming women for men's sexual desire, sexual exploitation, sexual jealousy, sexual diseases - you name it. So don't join the blame club just because it us the dominant model! 
It's not you.

The same can be said for women's sexual desires and impulses. if we want to be attractive, noticed, sexually alive, sexually active - yup - we are whores who live to drag men down to hell on the speedboat of their lust. You're not even supposed to be your natural sexual self.

Until a man wants you. And even then, he may unconsciously have to labor against history's tendency to characterize you in those ugly ways. I believe most men have to consciously develop a mature sexuality based on mutual respect and joy; there isn't much in the culture to encourage that process.

Long way of saying it's disgusting, infuriating, and ultimately tragic. But it's not you!!"
2334,"Hey there. I'm not saying that the comments you received were acceptable. However, there seems to be a disproportionate amount of shame that you are experiencing as a result of a stranger's actions that you are in no way responsible for."
2335,"i know the feeling. It makes me feel exactly like that: guilty and dirty. 

The culture in my country (especially when I was growing up, it’s getting better) allows this kind of communication. It’s not even something people really talk about. It just happens and if you dare defend yourself by insulting the person back or try to explain that you don’t want to be talked at like that, oh you’re a b*tch that can’t take a compliment or something.

It’s really frustrating because there’s no way to communicate with those types of people. They will never listen or open up their mind to see how wrong their behavior is. 

I’m so glad I moved out abroad and that happens less."
2336,"I've been violently harassed before and I feel the same way every time... I question everything I've done and think back into anything I could do to prevent it. It's awful, and I'm so sorry OP. It's okay to feel this way, but i'm glad that you know it's not your fault and says nothing about you."
2337,"I remember when something like this happened to me. It wasn’t long ago, two or three years maybe— point being that there’d already been a substantial movement to recognize that predatory behavior is never the victim’s fault. I fully believed that, and still do. What you wear, what you say, where you are, none of it gives someone “permission” to harass or assault you. 

Then it happened to me. And I felt doubly as guilty and dirty for thinking to myself how maybe my shirt really *was* too tight, or how maybe he was trying to be friendly and was absolutely terrible, or how I should’ve stood up for myself instead of freezing up. I was walking away, and thinking all these things, and beating myself up even more for thinking them. How could I so strongly believe that harassment and assault is never the victim’s fault, yet when it happens to me, I can’t stop blaming myself?

I absolutely second what everyone’s already said. You don’t *need* to feel guilty or dirty, because this isn’t your fault or your responsibility. But if that’s the way this interaction makes you feel, *that’s okay too.* It never should have happened, but since it did, you’re allowed to have negative feelings about it. You’re not fake feminist, or a fraud, or weak for feeling like this. Sending love and compassion your way ❤️"
2338,"there will always be assholes out there like this.

My advice is to not let them stop you and your happiness. If your progress pics makes you happy, please post em. Your posts of progress pics could give motivation to another girl who needs inspiration to to fit into that dress or just lose weight to feel more healthier.

My motto is ""F\*\*k guys and their messages. These are folks who hide behind a monitor and type stuff because they have no damn sense at all and most animals are brighter and more intelligent than these guys.

Please do not feel guilty about this. You are fine. It's the other folks who are messed up"
2339,[This article is an interesting read ](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/world/tim-berners-lee-web-women-scli-intl/index.html). It's one of the founders/inventors of the internet talking about how it's failing women.
2340,I feel the same way. My gym is closed but I normally run on the track. I’ve been going outside and the men who almost come to a fucking stop and stare at me is infuriating and honestly a huge reason why I prefer running on the indoor track
2341,"Creeps gonna creep. There’s nothing you can do to avoid them expect stop going outside and online. Which obviously is not an option. Well except for in regard to social distancing right now...

Some assholes behavior not your fault, it never is."
2342,"Creeps exist no matter what you look like, what you wear, what you do; how you look (or not look) at them. Creeps and misogyny are everywhere and there is nothing good enough you could possibly do, or want to do, to appease it.

So be angry, not guilty. It’s their fault. It’s their mistake.

El violador eres tu!! 🟢⚫️"
2343,"I had a breakdown with my landlord, who is a good friend of mine. He tends to get carried away, and when I am drinking, I tend to be a bit more emotional. I've been going through my own personal shit. As open minded as I am, I have also been on the receiving end of these comments and it makes you feel like meat, like a piece of garbage. I do not care whether it is male or female, let me say this: A PERSONS SELF WORTH SHOULD NOT BE GRADED OR DEPENDING ON HOW ATTRACTIVE THEY ARE! 

I know I am decently attractive, but because I get to hear this fucking disgusting bullshit all the time, I question my own self worth. If you're an adult, act like an adult, not like you're a horny 15 year old. 

I got an apology about it, but I feel like if I voice my opinion, then I am being ridiculous. I hold a lot of shit in because I don't want to be seen as a ""ridiculous female"".

Sorry I used your post as a vent, but I needed it. Thank you"
2344,"It is not you honey, there are some creeps out there and dont ever let them doubt yourself or feel negative keep shining girl cuz there will always be some creeps and some negative asses haha"
2345,"I used to work in a warehouse as a packer, 12 hours a day, so my looks weren't even on the list to care about, I looked like a homeless person when going to work.


But still, this car drove up to me and started asking my rates, they genuinely thought I was a prostitute.


I thought dang, if they're asking a homeless person for some action, they really have no standards. 


Oh yeah, they also wouldn't drive away so I started screaming like a banshee. I feel no guilt and no shame in what happened, they're the mindless beasts."
2346,"Even on reddit, if you post a picture that has a woman on it, any woman no matter how she's dressed, how she looks etc. You will get creepy comments. Always. The only exception is women dominated subs like /r/MakeupAddiction or /r/FancyFollicles."
2347,"This right here. You are not at fault for existing. You are not at fault for being a woman. Society has normalised the idea that for some reason we women, must be responsible for men's indecency.

Creepy men are creepy because they are rotten to the core. Not because you have larger breats. Or have shown some skin. You are not responsible for their behaviour. They are.

Don't let it get to you sis."
2348,"This is great strategy for getting over the guilt.  


We deserve to be treated like more than meat, and we teach people how to treat us.  If we let bad behavior slide, it often gets worse."
2349,"I like the way you put this. It seems like the requirement as women is to be pretty and sexy, but as soon as we take control of those labels and deny people permission to sexualize us they say we're prudes, and as soon as we *enjoy* being those things we get immense shit for it. It's a catch 22. But luckily, slowly I'm building a network of people who respect my feelings about being sexualized so that when I come back to my safe circle of friends I have them to recharge. Then I'm in the right headspace to deal with the random bs creepoes on the streets give me without spiraling."
2350,"Nothing is sacred. Got some PMs yesterday after posting on MakeupAddiction. What's wild is that there are subs dedicated to this material WITH WILLING PARTICIPANTS, but no, they want to choose the ones that are femme folks just having a good time, non-sexualized. This is what they mean when sexual assault and harassment is about power. The entitlement is unbelievable. 

To add to this too, the lid was recently blown off about how there are a lot of dudes who creep on /r/MakeupAddiction so much so that myself and other posters began getting recommended subs for basically soft core porn. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/fd2sg8/i_dont_know_wether_this_will_get_taken_down_or/) post addressed it. So essentially there are enough people creeping these subs that it adjusted the algorithm. I fucking hate it!"
2351,"Nope!! I once posted my shorts I had embroidered and fixed a rip in on a craft and embroidery sub (mostly women), still got a TON of dudes responding"
2352,"i just don’t understand that guys can literally look at porn in millions of different places, but they wanna come get their rocks off on a sub that’s literally women showing their makeup looks???"
2353,Wow. Nowhere is safe :(
2354,"Off-topic, but I think it's awesome that you fixed a rip on your shorts using embroidery. I have sewed up small rips on pants, or put in a hem to shorten khakis, but I'm usually too scared to embroider. Maybe now is a good time to pick up a new skill!!!

Do you recommend a particular Youtube channel or anything?"
2355,"The creeps get off on women in a non-sexual setting. Like the other user said, it’s all about power. I used to post on that same sub and got countless PMs afterwards after about wanting to see my tits, etc. it’s disgusting and I hate the entitlement of these fucking men."
2356,Especially when those same guys probably complain about women wearing too much makeup because apparently us trying to feel good about ourselves isn’t allowed
2357,Ummm no i think this was a random picture i saw one time that i just copied. I just went left to right and up and down repeatedly in all different colours and made a bright colourful patch 😊
2358,Love it :)
2359,"I commented on another one of your posts but my patio plants are thriving! The basil is sprouted and it's getting a little taller each day. My shamrocks look like they're fully revived. I don't talk to them much but my poor husband has to hear me talk about the ""planties"" and how green they're getting. 😂"
2360,"This sounds like PGAD:

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/249594

It may be being caused by stress, hence why stressing about it causes symptoms to worsen.

I know this might be embarrassing to talk to parents about, but lots of doctors are doing telemedicine these days. Perhaps just tell your parents that you are having some kind of side effect to the birth control (just calling or itching or something); or, if they don’t know about the birth control, then make up something that sounds like a yeast infection - anything to get on the phone with your gyno or another doctor.

Any doctor can prescribe a medication for stress/anxiety, and perhaps you just need to break the cycle? Either way, a doctor should be involved."
