1,"Overwatch - I'm back to dps after playing support (Brig/Ana) for a minute. Mostly playing Ashe, Reaper, McCree, Torb

WoW Classic - Got my husband to play with me for a weekend for my recent birthday, we leveled 2 night elves to level 10 - and he liked it! He's continued to play with me some evenings. So fun! 

D&D - Learning roll20 for online D&D fun, slowing putting together a one shot based in Wildemount"
2,"Stardew Valley and Skyrim. Both on the switch, and I'm just flipping back and forth between the two."
3,"trying to 100% binding of isaac during the quarentine and been playing tf2 when my internet doesn't die ;\~; 

also fallout new vegas been on my mind since I'm halway through it"
4,"I finished **Dragon Age: Origins** (Xbox One) and **Final Fantasy I: Anniversary Edition** (PS Vita). They both had their issues but I still enjoyed them, especially Dragon Age. I'll be moving on to Dragon Age 2 later in the year sometime.

Now I'm doing a replay of **Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** (Switch) which I just started a few days ago. I'm playing it on Master Mode with the DLC for the first time. I haven't played it since the launch in March 2017, and the three year gap was definitely enough to make it feel like a fresh experience again. I wanted to complete a second playthrough before BotW 2 gets released, so I figured now would be the best time. I'm playing it very stealthily and cautiously since the enemies can kill me in just two hits in the harder difficulty mode. I'm making sure I'm stocked up on the best meals at all times! My favourite thing to do is wait until night for the Bokoblins to go to sleep and then silently take them all out, or make them fall off mountains or into rivers by using a deku leaf to blow them away. :P

I'm also still playing **Rune Factory 4 Special** (Switch) but I've slowed down a bit with it because I've been playing so much BotW."
5,"Started both Celeste and Bioshock on the same day and im just alternating both. Sometimes you feel like dying 400 times on a 2 hours game, sometimes you feel like smashing enemies with a wrench. There's no inbetween."
6,"Basically nothing else than TFT right now (Autochess in League of Legends) cause I can just have it working on my second monitor and I do not need to pay full attention to it.

Pretty relaxing."
7,"Animal Crossing, of course. Still working on making a ton of money so I can add some more bridges and ramps to my island. The Easter event is nice, I love the cherry blossoms on the trees. Often getting an egg instead of a fish is a bit frustrating though.

Started playing For Honor again too. Disappointed that the testing grounds changes haven't made it to live yet though, playing with my Nuxia is often a pain. The Prince of Persia event is okay, I like the effects and the weapons but the game mode is too frustrating because of the Prince.

I also still need to finish RDR2, I stopped playing some time ago for some reason. I'm actually thinking of starting over because I kinda forgot what happened in my save game."
8,"Final Fantasy XIV - A friend gifted me a game card and I’ve been getting back into this game hard. I finished the Main quest line for the base game and now I’m partway through the first expansion pack. I’m already level 60 on my red mage and I’ve been leveling a healer as well so I can get through dungeon queue times faster. I picked scholar but I might level up white mage and astrologian a bit more just to see which one I like better.

Bravely Second - I tried out the Bravely Default 2 demo and it made me remember that I had picked up this game and then dropped it. I’m not sure why I did because I’ve been having a lot of fun with it so far. I’ve unlocked some more jobs and mixing and matching has been pretty fun.

Animal Crossing - I’ve been playing like an hour or so every day to progress on my island. I’m working on getting the KK Slider concert right now. I can’t wait to unlock terraforming so I can really start planning my island layout."
9,"Mostly been playing Fire Emblem: Three Houses at the moment and super close to the time skip! I'm doing better at recruiting students then I thought I would do and enjoying it a lot.  It feels like everyone I know is playing Animal Crossing which I'm not doing but I am watching my flatmate play every so often and  it's fun and charming. (I've played New Leaf before and liked it but I didn't love it so I'm quite happy to just watch someone else play it occasionally!)

I'm also running my first Call of Cthulhu session tonight online with some friends and hoping it goes okay and they have  a spooky fun time!"
10,"Hi there,

Every Friday we have a Find a Friend Friday megathread on the subreddit. Feel free to post there!

We also have a GirlGamers discord you can apply at on /r/GGDiscordInvites."
11,"First off, there are a lot of games for Mac, so usually no need to buy anything. Unfortunately a lot of the bigger games (e.g. The Witcher 3) are not released for macOS. Depending on what your genre of interest is (The Witcher = Open World, RPG) then you will find alternatives.

Now if you only have a MacBook, then you will only be able to run smaller games and I would recommend things like Stardew Valley (which gave this sub it's look) or Shadow of the Tomb Raider, if you need a it more action. I don't know if you mac can run it smoothly though and a mouse would def. be helpful here.

Also Portal. Great game and dialogs that gives you time and space to explore some cool game mechanics. Either way, register an account on https://store.steampowered.com and browse through the Mac OS X Section.

When in doubt, post back here."
12,"I love the Nancy Drew mystery games, I believe most of them have MacOS versions! There is a site/application called Steam for your desktop that often has really good deals on video games, I would recommend starting with that and searching through their library to try to find something that interests you. Just make sure to double check that any game you buy works on Mac (Steam is usually good about displaying this). There are tons and tons of different styles of games, so give a few different ones a try to see if you like it. If you have an idea of the style you might want to try (story based, action, mystery, cute, horror, etc etc) others/I might be able to give more concerete recs. Whatever you decide on, have fun! ^_^"
13,What are you willing to buy?/What is your budget?
14,"Fellow Mac gamer here. Or at least usted to, because I ended Up installing Windows using bootcamp. If you're tech savy or have Friends that would help you thats a good option, but if its not worth It for you, you can play on your Mac just fine. 

The thing is, games are often developed for Windows and then ported to Mac by third companies. So, It tales longer for most games to be released on Mac, and not all of them do. So thats the main reason some games cant be played on Mac (and Mac not fulfilling technical requirements, too). If the Game you want to play is both popular and old enough, you may be able to play It just fine.

As far as I know The Witcher I and II are available for Mac and are often discounted on Steam so keep an eye on them. Other redditors suggestion to get a mouse is also something to consider, trackpad was not intended for gaming"
15,I currently game on a Mac. It’s tough. I can’t play games for too long because they start to lag from my computer overheating (make sure to have it on a hard flat surface like a table or book). You will probably need to set every game to low graphics and such. I haven’t really tried pushing my computer too much. It plays life is strange pretty well. Minecraft and LOL runs decently too.
16,"Gaming on Macs is tough, because there's less selection and they're usually not optimized for gaming performance like a PC is. Witcher 1 and 2 are available on Mac but they're older games and if you've never played a video game at all before, you may find it too challenging or overwhelming. You will also struggle unless you have a mouse or controller to play these games - it's very difficult to game with a track pad.

Honestly, my biggest recommendation for you is Stardew Valley. It's a farming simulation game but has a ton of depth. It's very easy to grasp the basics and there's no ""losing"", but it still has a really high skill ceiling. Pretty cheap on Steam, it's playable with a track pad, and the graphics are very simple so your Mac should run it easily. It's one of my favorite games of all time, and you can easily spend 100s of hours on it and still find things to do, which is perfect in quarantine. The Stardew Valley subreddit is very warm and welcoming if you want to find out more about the game :)

If you have the money to splurge at some point or if you have a birthday coming up, or if your family is looking to invest in some at-home entertainment, a Switch would be perfect. It has a huge library of games of all genres, including multiplayer."
17,"If you decide to stick with your Mac to get started (which is a good idea, see what kind of games you like before investing in a new computer or console) there's a website called ""Can I Run It?"" that will determine if your computer can handle and run the game smoothly.

I second the Nancy Drew Mystery Games. They are puzzle based, casual, and don't take too long to complete. I would say the average time length is 5-15 hours."
18,"I managed to play the sims for years on my MacBook! I also played Borderlands, the Tomb Raider reboot and Portal, all of which I would recommend. I’ve seen other people say Stardew Valley which is also a good shout. If you have a little money then a Switch Lite is a good introduction to games (you can play lots on it from The Witcher to Stardew Valley to Mario) and isnt as expensive as a full console."
19,"I was able to play the second Witcher game on my Mac, but it was a few years ago, not sure it still works. Had a blast tho!"
20,My razer krakens completely covers my ear so that might be a good option. It completely envelops my ears and it doesn’t press on my glasses much so it might be good for you too.
21,Any headset that’s fully over your ears should work well! I used to have on ear headphones and they drove me crazy while wearing my glasses. I now have the Steelseries Arctic 5 headset and it’s the comfiest headset I’ve ever worn. I don’t even notice my glasses until it’s been over 6 hours.
22,this \^ I have them & they're the coziest headset I've ever worn and I have new piercings PLUS glasses
23,Who keeps downvoting these posts about people happy they get AC after they couldn't get it on launch.
24,"My sleeping schedule is all over the place since this whole pandemic started.. couldn't fall asleep at all and was still awake at 5am.

I should stop playing and browsing reddit I guess :D"
25,"Yeah, that's how Animal Crossing is. Well, 30 mins is a little pessimistic. But it has been amusing to see people hyping themselves up over getting the game at a time when they're stuck indoors. I think people forget that, yes, you may have emptied 300 hours into New Leaf, but actually that was maybe two short shifts morning and evening over the course of a year.

LM3 is great. Next Level Games have some amazing animators on their team."
26,"I'm actually playing LM3 now too.  So far I love the puzzles, and the overall fun vibe."
27,Modern warfare
28,Rythm games as a whole. Of course I still feel super smooth when I crank the speed up 0.2 and destroy something on normal though.
29,Apex and R6
30,"Almost all of them probably , so I stick to single player 😂"
31,Destiny 2
32,Any FPS. I cling to my 1.0 k/d as much as possible
33,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is a great turn based RPG with a lot of strategy involved. It's actually a very difficult game if you don't strategise accordingly. It's a very long game and will keep you both occupied for hours. There's plenty of quests to do that are interesting, and not just fetch quests. It's got an interesting story and characters too. Not sure if an RPG with strategy elements is what you're looking for but thought I'd mention it anyways!

You could also always start with Divinity Original Sin 1, which was still meant to be very good (although 2 made a lot of improvements on aspects of the gameplay so it's up to you which one you go with) though I never personally played this one so I don't know how it compares to the 2nd one, but I know a lot of people enjoyed it!"
34,"Crusader Kings 2, Civilization 5 (it's not very technical and you can usually get the full collection really cheap), Don't Starve Together (technically it's a survival/base building game but it's a fun one nontheless). If I wasn't at work, I might have remembered more, but all of these are pretty fun, with different learning curves."
35,Divinity 1 & 2 might be great.
36,We were here and we were here too. They are great puzzle multiplayer games. I think the first is free
37,Maybe give State a Decay 2 a shot?
38,"Borderlands 2 is a fantastic co-op game and is IMO better than Borderlands 3 (which is great too).

Civ 5 is also super fun and you can play co-op against AI or free for all. I wouldn’t say it’s too technical for a strategy game.

Portal 2 co-op is really fun as well!"
39,I really like league of legends tft mode. You buy characters that have different “tags” and when you get x amount of those you get extra things (like more healing or more gold). You place your characters on a grid and fight other players. You can level up your characters and put items on them to make them better.
40,How about Unravel 2?
41,I'm watching someone play it right now while I'm waiting for my copy to arrive. It looks so much fun!
42,r/PetTheDamnCat
43,How can you resist. Such a cute fluff.
44,"Still don't know what's happening with mine as I pre-ordered from my local game shop and they've not got back to me yet about what's happening :( 

Where did you get yours from?"
45,I'm so jealous! I have 9 days!!
46,My bf got the notification for his today. It was his Father's Day/Birthday/Christmas present. (His bday is in December lol) Because we got the deluxe edition that came with the Cloud figure.
47,Nine days for me
48,Are the mechanics of it the same? Like the materia?
49,I am really considering picking up the original for Switch.
50,I have been waiting to play this game for fifteen years!
51,Amazon says mine is being delivered on the 14th :(
52,This is super cute
53,Very cute!
54,LOOKS PURRFECT TO ME. 😻
55,I love it!!!
56,"This is cute 😍 I just ordered my switch, can't wait for it to arrive."
57,[I plan to get this one when I get my switch](https://www.etsy.com/listing/686078190/cute-corgi-pup-pastel-swirl-skin-for-the?ref=hp_rv-1&bes=1)
58,Thank you!! 💕
59,Thanks!!  💕
60,"where did you find one?! I've been looking EVERYWHERE online and they're either super high in price or they're sold out 
  
:("
61,Where did you get the paw pads from? o:
62,I'm in Europe and here we still have them in stores.
63,"[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072WRX5M6/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o01\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072WRX5M6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Off amazon! I got a whole set that came with many different colors. :)

Edit- this set appears to be out of stock but they have tons of others just like it!"
64,Thank you :) I really like your case but I know I would have so much trouble putting it on :( I can’t even put on a phone screen protector without getting bubbles or dirt under it
65,It's so much easier than screen protectors because you're able to pick it back up before you completely put it on. I had to re-adjust mine multiple times. I used a hair dryer to then heat it up a little and all the kinks were able to be rubbed out. The bubbles you can also just push out! Mine isn't applied the best but it is very easy compared to applying a screen protector. Totally recommend!
66,What’s the game in the background? It looks familiar but I don’t really know anymore.
67,that looks cozy as hell!
68,"Nice😂 
Modern problems, modern solutions"
69,For honour
70,"I just... I'm in love and I want to know how to create the exact same look for my own Switch. To me, it's the most beautiful thing I've seen  in a long time."
71,Wowwww 😍🥰
72,So cute!!!!
73,"I'd love to do this to my switch, but I share it with my husband. :'( So no girly cute stuff for me."
74,This is brilliant! Also I wanna see the post with amazing nails!
75,Beautiful :)
76,"Wow that’s pretty neat, does it make it a lot easier to hold?"
77,I don't have any nails (male ) but I'm so gonna do that my hands are small so hoping will be better to hold 😁
78,I’m in love 😍 what a great idea
79,Can I ask why the popsockets?
80,That's fucking genius
81,It's delicious Switch candy 😍 really well done! Ever since that post I've been wanting to put popsockets on mine (what a great idea). But I got stuck in design indecision hell and now it's just a way of life.
82,btw best buy has holders you can snap onto your switch thay make it easier to hold handheld like it's one big controller :)
83,It’s so pretty!!!
84,Stunning 😍😍
85,You just blew my mind. Also this skin looks so good. I just ordered a skin.
86,omg this colour is cute!
87,Cute case
88,yeah I may or may not have gone on etsy because of this and picked out a skin and thumbgrips for the switch I plan to buy. I cant wait. Its got a cute little corgi butt on it :D
89,doesn't this prevent you from docking it? or is this the switch lite or w/e its called
90,"Help me out here, because it looks awesome. What am I looking at?"
91,Thanks! It's a skin off Etsy and rose quartz popsockets
92,Thanks 😊
93,What about a design yall both agree on?
94,I bought this rubberized shell with controller style back that makes it a lot easier to hold! I just bought the plain black which is about as neutral as you can get. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07457V4XJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_SucHEbHKJWRN1
95,Literally same.
96,"I'll try to find it.
Found it!
https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/en2srj/i_got_my_fiancé_a_switch_and_skyrim_for_christmas/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
97,Yes. I have small hands and before I would rest it on my pinkies which would strain them after a while. I had trouble reaching all the buttons before also.
98,"You....you know men have nails too, right?"
99,"I have small hands as well and this shell really helped me! I was getting hand cramps 15 minutes into playing Mario kart before I bought it. 
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07457V4XJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_SucHEbHKJWRN1"
100,For comfort. I have small hands and resting the bottom of my switch on my pinkies strains them and I have trouble reaching the buttons.
101,Thank you. To be fair it took me about a month to decide what aesthetic I was going for.
102,I don't like how bulky they make it. I like that the popsockets collapse and it can still fit in the case easily.
103,Woo hoo! The skin was surprisingly easy to apply. It sat untouched for 2 days before I applied it in fear of messing it up. Have a blow dryer handy to smooth out the edges.
104,"Oh my gosh. I love corgi butts. So thicc and fluffy, lol"
105,It is the lite. No docking required
106,This is my issue as well. I charge my switch in the dock and I’m pretty sure these would make it too thick. My pinky fingers would be so much happier though.
107,I covered my switch lite in a skin and put fancy popsockets on it to make it easier for my tiny hands to hold.
108,"I use this one but for my switch lite and it's yellow. I like that I can change the grips out and they are different sizes. 

Skull & Co. GripCase Set: A Dockable Protective Case with Replaceable Grips [to fit All Hands Sizes] for Nintendo Switch - Neon Red & Blue https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078WHH1KR/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_-kdHEbGYZ4VH9"
109,Thank you! Very lovely nails indeed!
110,pretty sure he means hes not out here with french tip 2 inch nails lol
111,"Of course but I do not , I get to nervous and bite them 😣"
112,"Woe thx 😁 will definitely get that,
 there not really made for little people I tend to get cramps fast to ."
113,I have this for my Switch and can confirm it’s a great case.
114,I also use this case! I love it.
115,"I have this for my switch too and it's awesome. The different grips all accommodate me, my husband, and my 5 year old !"
116,"Raft if you like survival/ crafting 
Borderlands (any of them) because they have a lot of side missions and DLC 
Unrailed 
Terraria 
Trine (any of them)"
117,"I'd suggest Divinity: Original Sin II. It's huge with a lot of amazing story and content to dive into. It has turn based combat, so it's easy to talk over. 
However, if one is not into that type of game, it's pretty easy to get burn out on, I'd say."
118,"I highly recommend Children of Morta. It's got a solid gameplay loop and it's one of the best couch co-op games I've played since Castle Crashers. If you're more into platformers, Ray-man Legends is a great multiplayer game too!"
119,Have you played anything from the Worms franchise? You can team up to fight other teams or fight each other.
120,"Not sure if they are the type of games you and your boyfriend like, but me and my boyfriend enjoy playing the multiplayer version of Stardew Valley and the co-op mode of Portal 2.

Stardew Valley is, of course, more on the casual side, and Portal 2 provides some interesting challenges to play together which can be really fun!"
121,"Others made good suggestions, I'd like to add in Farm Together. It's cute and super chill, I play it a lot with my bf and it's one of my fav games we do with each other."
122,"My boyfriend and I had a very good time in The Forest. You can build, collect, craft, hunt, explore and fight as well as follow the mystery story when you feel like it. We modded it so that the surface enemies are less numerous and aggressive and our base couldn't be destroyed, so we could play in a more relaxed way."
123,"Trove is a really fun easy game to play and just hangout while chatting. There's fighting and building and when you level up you can make your own world. In pay sure it's free, with things to buy in game. 

There's also terraria!"
124,"You could play an mmo - ffxiv, WoW, Swtor"
125,"I’ll have to have another look at Raft and Unrailed, we’ve played the rest of your suggestions in the past, albeit before we were together. Thanks for the suggestions."
126,"Ah, it’s a really good suggestion, but we’ve already played through it once and gotten through most of a second play through with mods haha."
127,"I also recommend this! Such a good game!  
  
Also, u/Dreaming-of-Irkalla, if you're into Dark Souls-esque games, try out Salt and Sanctuary!"
128,I’ve played some in the past but don’t think that’s really something we’d enjoy but thanks for the suggestion.
129,"I’ve played a lot of Portal in the past so don’t think that would work. I haven’t been able to get into Stardew by  myself but maybe it would be different with him so I’ll have to see how he feels about it, thanks."
130,No worries! Hope you find something that works for you both! :)
131,Congrats!
132,That’s so lucky! Congratulations! I just bought the same CPU for my build and I’m really happy with it! :)
133,"That's awesome, congrats! That's certainly a really nice little component for your build!

Post pics when you finish it 🙂"
134,That's awesome!
135,Eh oh!  CONGRATULATIONS!!!  It's exciting to see someone here get it!!
136,Congrats!!
137,Congrats! That's super awesome!
138,Thank you \^\_\^
139,"I love to study with game music as well! Some of my favourite OST to concentrate are the Journey OST, Assassin's Creed Syndicate OST and the Child of Light OST. 

I will also look into the music you listed!"
140,"Ori, Persona 5."
141,I used to work to the sound of the Pillars of Eternity OST. It's absolutely wonderful!
142,"Ori and the Blind Forest, Ori and The Will of the Wisps, God of War (2014), Nioh 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Shadow of the Colossus, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, Shadow of Mordor, Assassin's Creed Black Flag, Divinity Original Sin, Pillars of Eternity, Children of Morta, and obviously, Skyrim."
143,Pokemon sword/shield and fire emblem three houses have a great soundtrack.
144,"I love the Neir Automata soundtrack! I think you'd like the OSTs of Ori and the Blind Forest, Gris, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Stellaris."
145,"* Iconoclasts

* Castlevania (there's maybe a song or two in the series with lyrics used for end credits, but a majority of it is instrumental)

* Catmaze (not sure if an OST is sold or easy to find tbh but I think I saw one not too long ago)

* Bloodstained : Ritual of the Night/Curse of the Moon

* Crypt of the Necrodancer

* Cadence of Hyrule

* Cthulhu Saves the World

* Killer Instinct

* Doom (mostly the 2016 and Eternal, though the rest of the soundtrack from the series is good too)

* After Death

* Transistor, though be aware that has lyrics in some of its tracks.

* The Legend of Zelda series in general.

* Hotline Miami

There might be more that I can't remember right now because I'm on mobile and don't have my complete music list in front of me, but that should cover the better stuff going off the top of my head."
146,"I'm offended that no one mentioned Mass Effect. Dragon Age also has great music, though you should most likely avoid Inquisition because it has a lot of songs with actual lyrics."
147,"I love the music in the Final Fantasy games (especially IX), and Undertale has a wonderful soundtrack too"
148,"If you want soundtracks with no lyrics check out the soundtracks for Hotline miami 1/2, Furi, and Ruiner.

Love those so much. Might be hard to concentrate on work though 🤷‍♀️"
149,Child of Light! Also Sayonara Wild Hearts tracks 9-25.
150,"I second (or third) the recommendation for Ori and the Blind Forest, it's got a lovely soundtrack. I also recommend Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Octopath Traveler. Both have a lot of great music. XC2 does have some songs with English lyrics but not many so they should be easy to avoid"
151,"The Pyre soundtrack is also great, on par with the OST from Bastion. If you like 8bit stuff the Cave Story music is FIRE. It's been 5+ years since I've played and I can still remember multiple songs almost completely. Also The Witcher 3."
152,"Shatter has the best soundtrack for a game nobody ever played.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldBKPWjD1os

Also nobody has mentioned VVVVVV, Bloodborne (Especially the DLC) or the Donkey Kong Country games yet."
153,"Or just any Persona game, depending on what you like. All of them have pretty good soundtracks!"
154,"I was gonna make a suggestion..but this is, this is pretty much it :3 XD"
155,"Also, for anyone wondering, game is the Division 2. 

I'm in love with it so far. Just hit WT 4. Survivalist specialization. I use a high skill tier build and run the healing chem and attack drone currently."
156,Omg i love this game! I havent downloaded the new update yet (gear 2.0 or whatever they called because ive been lazy) but i had just made it to WT 5 a few days before. I also use healing chem! But i use hive (stinger or restorer depending if by myself or with a group) as my other skill. Also a survivalist with lots of skill power! (idk what stat that would be now with the changes.) Congratsies on getting that color! Is always nice to be able to match and color coordinate and everything! ❤
157,"

Proof everything is better pink 😁"
158,I think high skill tier is the way to roll in this new patch - got 12 nodes in firearms and still take forever to kill them legendary enemies. Also your character looks goals - how'd you get that mask?
159,"Hey I'm looking for grils to play this game with, can you add me to uplay? Cristina.kity"
160,"I've now hit WT5 lol. 

I actually really liked the skin I was using before. Submerged. It was like pink and green but I'm thrilled on the matching set.

I'm still not sure that I'm set on the drone right now but it lasts forever and it's kind of like having a helpful pet so I might keep it around. Healing chem though. 💕"
161,"Skill tier has also been great for keeping my bf alive. I love him but I swear to god he spends 90% of the game out of cover.

Also I honestly have no idea. I think I've had it since nearly the beginning of the game. Thanks though. I adore her."
162,"If you'd like to find new people to play with, please use our  [Find a Friend Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/search?sort=new&q=find+a+friend+friday&restrict_sr=on) megathread."

I run a high damage, high shield build. Shotgun, mid range assault/SMG with crusader shield and jammer/firefly. Currently demolitionist, working towards firewall. I bring my cover in my backpack! 😬"
164,Thanks :-)
165,Those googly eyes make reaper actually creepy 😅
166,"I'm going to die of laughter when someone starts spamming ""Too edgy for you?"" with those eyes."

169,👀
170,"There's also eyes on the training bots, Torb's turret, Rein's shield (not all skins), and Hanzo's dragons. XD"
171,I'm glad Blizzaed knows how to have a good time!
172,The dragons are what had ne dying of laughter!!
173,"I'm looking forward to getting P5R, but I'm gonna wait until it goes down in price a bit as I have other games to play first.

Anyways hope you enjoy it!! I enjoyed the original so much that I platinumed it haha."
174,I gotta get one of those jackets.
175,Very nice purchase!
176,Lucky. Had it pre-ordered from best buy and they sold my copy so a replacement is being shipped out but I won't have it on release.
177,"It’s my favorite series of all time, so I couldn’t wait! My girlfriend is playing animal crossing and I’ll be playing P5R and then we are gonna switch when I beat it!!"
178,"It was a gift from my girlfriend, I think it’s from wish, she got me the jacket and a t-shirt with Tae Takemi on it :)"
179,"That’s horrible, I’m sorry :("
180,That's cute! Animal Crossing is another game on my list too actually! I'm currently replaying Breath of the Wild though so I'll be busy for a while... :P
181,Animal crossing is so good! It’s my first animal crossing title and this is my girlfriend’s first Persona title :)
182,"Persona 5 was my first too! I plan to play P3 + 4 on my Vita at some point too. Unsure about playing P1 + 2, as I hear they're very different from the others.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons will be my second Animal Crossing game. My first was City Folk on the Wii but I didn't like it much. Giving New Horizons a chance though as it looks amazing and I love the look of all the customisations you can do! It looks way better than any other Animal Crossing so far!"
183,"Persona 3 and 4 are both amazing, if the vita has Persona 3 Portable edition and not just FES, portable is the only game in the modern series with a playable female protagonist, it’s not the best version of the game but she’s a good character. Persona 1 & 2 feel very different, they’re harder and feel way more niche. I’d only pursue them if you really end up loving 3 and 4 and want more. The great thing is there are a lot of spinoffs now. Persona 3, 4 and 5 have dancing games. There are 2 fighting games with the casts of 3 & 4. And there are 2 3DS games with cast crossovers too!"
184,Yeah that's true! There's a lot for me to play haha. :)
185,"I know 4 is more like 5, with multiple dungeons. Persona 3 is really just 1 giant dungeon so it can be more daunting, plus it’s harder so I’d recommend maybe just working backwards. But 3 has some of my all time favorite music in the series! I hope you enjoy them when you get a chance!! ☺️"
186,"Thanks, I'm sure I will!"
187,Aww that's cute! What game is this?
188,This is sea of thieves

193,"Well that was a journey... I feel like I've just travelled through the brain of one very confused individual. Is he trying to say he doesn't like girls who game because he doesn't like the boys that game with girls who game? I can't begin to get my head around his logic here. 

But then I guess it's not his fault for having a penis....?"
194,"I read like a third of it until my brain went boom...

I don't wanna know the rest, and regardless of if he thinks that, or if he is simply trying to be super edgy on the internet, he is still a dumbass."

200,How old was this guy? Yeesh that's painful.
201,What was the photo at the bottom?
202,Did you get the vapors and fall onto a fainting couch after that exchange? It's okay if you did. Its not your fault you have those ovaries weighing you down and all that estrogen befuddling your thoughts!
203,YikesYikesYikes

I dont really know what I could do about it when she gets to the age where she starts interacting with people online.

I'm just going to keep telling her that she's strong and smart and doesn't need anyone's validation from the internet. If anyone has any other suggestions I'd love to know (outside of monitoring her internet time/site usage, making sure she accesses safe sites, knows to tell me if anyone is asking her personal questions).

She's only 6 now but I've had this on my mind and everytime I read stories like this it adds to the worry."
205,I can’t think of a single person with less of an ability to socialize than this dude right here.

Tell us please."
215,">from my experience of women on the internet they live for attention

And men don't? Then what the hell are the Paul brothers doing if it's not for any kind of attention good or bad?"
216,good on you for not getting angry back tho and not feeding his weird ego.
217,"Fucking hate incels dude, and how are they so oblivious. “I’m not an incel” *recites the incel ideals*"
218,What a butthole
219,he sounds like a sad little fuck boy.
220,"I was about to go to sleep
Now I'm thinking about which cranberry fucknut came up with the idea that men are superior to women and that women can't game and every other misogynistic ideal. 
Seriously which royal class buffoon invented misogyny? 
If I ever find out, well, I'm gonna pay someone to make a time machine for me"
221,I can't believe you didn't just block him immediately... It what i would've done lol
222,"You handled it well, good on you for sticking up for yourself and us with dignity. Best way to deal with incels and trolls is to stonewall them. We just want to play games in a safe, non-abusive environment. None of us are out here trying to get fame or attention. His reality is so distorted and probably shaped by his inability to attract a romantic partner. I doubt he will get a date at all that lovely personality."
223,Should’ve unleashed your army of horny men on him
224,"How in the world can someone believe they are not an incel when they view women like that. “I don’t hate women. Psh. I hate men who are nice to women so that’s why I have to be mean to women.” 

Yeah ok sure buddy. Intelligent conversation my ass. At least he was honest enough that you could end the convo. 

Today I had a guy team-kill me in rainbow six siege just because I have miss in my name. I hadn’t even said anything in game. I team-killed back (I waited until he thought he was safe and would get to kill someone. Oh lord what a fine moment.) and he lost his shit. I told him his name (BigMo or something) was probably him compensating for his tiny wiener and he left the game. 

I seriously wonder what goes through their head. I honestly can’t imagine them as normal human beings in real life."
225,"Obvious troll is obvious, he started that conversation with a goal in mind. You dealt with that in the best way possible.  Two thumbs up. 

Also, reserving the option to use the title line in my future attempts to make friends. I feel like that’s a winner."
226,“I don’t abuse until I know for sure” what....
227,Damn what a dummy
228,Holy shit.

234,Yoooo wtf? What are you doing my guy.
235,Sorry...but what the whole fuck? Really dude?
236,Was that a dick pic at the end?
237,"For some reason I thought he quoted a sentence from ‘mean girls’ with the whole vagina thing. But nope, it’s just him being a sexist dude"
238,I have less brain cells after reading this.
239,“Don’t project onto me” was a bold statement after all his...projecting.
240,"""im not an incel"""
241,"Fucking hell, I hope that's not indicative of a standard conversation you ladies have to endure."
242,I feel compelled to give you a sisterly virtual hug after reading that horrible chat :( Good luck
243,I'm so happy I didn't somehow grow up to be this kind of guy.
244,"As soon as he said, ""I'm not an incel,"" I started hearing his weird incel rant to the tune of Hoobastank's *The Reason.*"

Definitely a bad person."
246,boooomer's attitude
247,Such good socialising skills that he needs a dating app.
248,"Jokes on him, it *is* my fault that I (>!will!<) have a vagina."
249,He meant a bot loool
250,when you've never met an actual woman in your life
251,I'm just wondering.. What did he wanted or expected from that conversation?
252,Omg what was the photo?!
253,Wow what a fucking lunatic
254,Good grief between the grammatical errors and twisted logic I don't think I even understand what he was trying to say 🤷 He's mad because you play video games and have a vagina? He's mad because girls stream? He's mad because he felt the need to give up video games and you still enjoy yourself?
255,The worst thing is that that guy thinks he's so much more smarter then everyone else lol god it's so sad
256,"And this is on dating site? Does his profile just say, ""Don't worry, ladies. It's not your fault you have vaginas?""

How on Earth did he think whatever the hell that was was going to get him a date?"
257,Lemme guess he sent a dick pic
258,wow...I cant even...
259,Dude probably got his ass murked one too many times by a girl in a fps
260,"What photo did they send at the end?? This looks like the worst exchange, too much to point out. Sorry you had to deal with this douchebag."
261,Is it worth asking what’s photo he sent?
262,Fucking yikes.
263,What a fuckin scrub.
264,"I read a little and now, I think I have blood pressure issues. Why won't natural selection just start doing what it's supposed to do? 
I'm sorry you had to bear through that, avoid toxic people the moment you sense one. It's not worth all the effort of explaining them."
265,This genuinely sickens me 🤮
266,WTF did i just read?
267,This shit makes me so angry that I just feel...exhausted now
268,You have the patience of a saint. I would've torn him a new one.

270,"Him: girls make assumptions and jump to the worst conclusions about men but also are swimming in a sea of men falling over them

Also him out of nowhere: god why are you saying I'm abusive I'm a really nice guy it's not your fault you have a vagina!"
271,Bc you play games with your genitalia?? Men can be wild creatures
272,You can tell he's a totally happy and always smiling person because he's says so like 80 times.
273,"I’m a nice guy. 

I like toxic communities. 

???"
274,[removed]
275,"I do see where he's coming from. But he's wrong. It sucks, I think he was either trolling, cuz he held the convo for too long, or he was hurt by someone. 

I'll tell you right now it's hard to game with other girls and guys for me. But I can't be unbiased about it. With autism I misinterpret shit online all the time.

All in all just keep your head up and ignore him. The negative ones are always the loudest and not everyone is like that. Smile and ignore them. They don't know you."
276,"LOL @ ""I'm not an incel"""

283,"I'm always surprised when I see these kinds of convos & posts how long women will continue talking. (I'm a guy)

I'd have blocked them somewhere between:

and

284,"Yes, an incel."
285,"Very courageous of him, trying to piss off someone with an army."
286,"And he's not projecting onto her at ALL with that comment, right?"
287,"I'm guessing it's like how some guys refuse to watch any anime with male characters in it just to avoid seeing the male and female characters interact with each other (even if it's not romance/sexual anime), because they feel that the girls have to only interact with either them the viewer, or the other girls (whether friends, lesbians, or pseudo-lesbians who only might like the viewer), a sort of possessiveness of, ""I don't like girls who could potentially like other guys"" type of thinking. They see any other male who could be considered better than them, as competition.

It's actually common from what I see in the fanservice-heavy anime/gaming communities sadly. For example there's a game called ""BanG Dream!"", which is a rhythm game of all girls, and when they added one separate group of boys in it (which they intended to make for a separate game just taking place in the same universe), it started a controversy and rage with the male fans, and even the creator announced how he himself wishes for the girls in the game to never contact with the male characters, that the only males the girls will ever interact or be seen with is their dads. :x Really sad that that has to be said and done just to not anger such entitled insecure men, but also that multiple male game creators are like this (there's been several JRPGs where the creators will say things like how they wanted their game to be a hentai/porn game of female characters, but toned it down just enough to not be considered porn. Might have been Nier or God Eater iirc?).

I'd also seen some comments on anime forums about how many guys only like a heterosexual hentai if the guy is super hideous like a gross-looking ogre or tentacle monster. That would also explain how many games that are gender-locked/character-locked will have tons of sexy female characters and then boring or ugly-looking dude characters, for those kind of guys who get insecure easily (and blame women as being ""easily offended""), those guys who get offended by equality."
288,"You pretty much hit the nail on the head. You see, he's way better than those other simps because instead of obsessing over being nice to women, he is superior by obsessing over being shitty to them. Fucking checkmate, white knights! Women don't rule over him! (Except they still take up every corner of his mental space but shh)"
289,">But then I guess it's not his fault for having a penis

Yes, I think this is indeed the moral of the story XD."
290,"Really, why did they keep going? It was like mining a pile of shit, and you keep hitting deeper levels of shit... at some point you have to assume it is solid shit all the way down."
291,"You can guess the rest tbh, which isn't a good thing"
292,"Ikr?! 

Good. Stay away. Saves us having to block you. 

He's effectively quarantining his own misogyny lol"
293,I don’t get guys like this.  Do you know how awesome it is having one of your main hobbies in common with your SO?  Pretty damn awesome.
294,Truly a loss for women everywhere.

301,Yikes on bikes
302,"Hey, reading this made me happy that you care so much. I would recommend for her when she is older, to just block rude/upsetting people. I continued this on as I found it entertaining to talk to someone with such a warped view, so it didn't hurt my feelings :)

I would recommend not really monitoring her heavily. Things like not wanting her on the computer all night are normal and fine. However for example, reading through her messages and that sort of thing  (as a continuous thing, I understand certain circumstances require it) wont help. Invasions of privacy will make your kid secretive.

The best advice I can give is something I read. Ill post it under here but just to be clear its  not OC. Its not a super long read but its a great example.

-insert hole in plasterboard wall image-

""Our girls were messing around yesterday. One of them happened to put their body through the drywall. My nine year old came downstairs crying and frantic saying she had to show me something. I walked upstairs to the damaged wall. The remorse was already displayed all over her body. 

She didn’t need me to make her feel guilty. 

She didn’t need me to shame her. 

She didn’t need me to make an already crappy situation worse. 

“I’m sorry!!!”

I know you are. 

“Daddy is going to be so mad!!! I’m not ready to tell him yet.”  

That is OK. When you are ready, you will tell him. 

She knew. She knew that he was the one most impacted by this. He would be the one taking time from his day to fix this. 

I walked downstairs and told my husband. 

The kids put a hole in the wall. A big one. M is really upset about it. She’s working up the courage to come and tell you about it. 

We have two choices here. 

1.  Scream and yell and make her feel more awful than she already does. 
2. Accept that little girl for each bit of awesome that she is... even in her mistakes. To realize that it was SO hard for her to come down and tell you how she made a mistake. 

Our response will 100% determine how she comes to us with mistakes in the future. 

How do you respond?  

Today, my daughter walks around with a little more trust. She walks around feeling loved and connected. She walks around knowing that she can tell her parents anything and that she is safe. 

This was the best gift I could ever receive this Christmas. 

And yes. She still feels sorry. She offered to not receive any Christmas presents this year, all her savings, and her time to help fix it. She didn’t need screaming parents to make her feel this. She did it all on her own. """
303,"I'm confused by it too, the part she used as the title came totally out of left field for me, i have no idea what he meant by that and a lot of the stuff after."
304,"My ex-boyfriend, screaming at the top of his lungs:

I was wondering that, too!  Fortunately she answered it, but it was easily missable."

307,"Don't worry, I wouldnt generalize a entire gender of people based on a few experiences."

I don't want to believe this is a thing

321,You only have to look at how the vast majority of female characters are portrayed in video games. In both looks and the characters themselves.
322,"Probably not God Eater, they've got a balanced gender ratio and the characters interact with another well. I don't know much about NieR but I feel like there's only three characters and they're all same looking wearing monochrome lolita bondage outfits."

330,"Oh God, I laughed out loud.  Would it be too much to ask you to upload it to imgur?  I'm curious if my mental picture of him matches reality.  You can obscure his face or something."
331,Yikes forever
332,"I appreciate your advice. I know it's going to be a struggle between keeping her safe and letting have freedom (and for any other kids we have, regardless of gender).

We do try to practice that advice and instead of yell, we have a family discussion about how we're all feeling and what seems right and what seems wrong.

We actually did this a while ago because she wasn't listening and seemed very angry. She had a safe space to talk and afterward she seemed to feel better. Now dont get me wrong, we've had to send her to her room too lol but we try to respect her as a person, despite her young age.

We will definitely have to consider what is a healthy amount of monitoring. I might add a website blocker to things that seem WAAYYYY inappropriate for young kiddos.

Thanks again for your words. Definitely things to think about."

There is a understandable punishment needed for purposeful stuff like being rude. Its more how some parents handle kids accidents, some do as if they did it on purpose ya know?

(Edit: also it’s fairly cheap and frequently on sale. I bought The Handsome Collection [which includes BL2 and The Pre-Sequel and all the DLC for both] when it was on sale for $15 CAD, and I’ve seen it as low as $6)."
360,Sims is always a good choice
361,"I’ve been playing 2 point hospital, pillars of eternity 2, Wasteland 2, don’t starve, pathfinder kingmaker, torchlight 2, also if you like adventure games Agent A was super cute and good puzzles. My time at Portia is good too. And maybe consider a free to play mmo. So much content it will get you through months"
362,"I have a not-built-for-gaming laptop and I play Farm Together, Stardew Valley, and Sims 4 on it.  They're all the kind of games that could entertain for months/years to come."
363,Play Outlast. It will make you shit your pants (literally)
364,"Celeste is really good

Minecraft obviously, cause why not If you like 2d more you could look into Terraria or the ""sequel"" to it as well

Stardew Valley as someone mentioned

All of it is very playable on laptops."
365,I've dumped 600+ hours in it lol. I was thinking about trying to do multiplayer with someone but all my gamer friends are lame :(
366,"Hey guys,

This is literally my first reddit post ever 

I'm a twitch streamer who just reached affiliate stage and I'm looking for a community, just a place to find like-minded streamers to play with and enjoy each others content

I just had my first subscriber and I'm stoked about it and I'd love if anyone wants to come and hang out, I stream Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 8pm-11pm ish BST

twitch.tv/esmudger"
367,"Hey guys, hope you're staying safe!! This month has been really hectic for me & my newly formed team- in late February I formed a volunteer team for a month long game jam and our game is almost complete!

The game is an otome (girl x boy dating sim) / girls love (girl x girl dating sim) visual novel about a college student who finds a mysterious group on campus and goes exploring with them.

[Main Character Bio](https://twitter.com/CrystalGameWork/status/1242602855321817088)  \-  [Screenshots](https://twitter.com/CrystalGameWork/status/1242897158413725696) 

We're hoping to have the game up and ready by mid April- you can see it on Steam [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1274200/Enamored_Risks/)! Please stay indoors if you can, hopefully I'll remember to post an update next week!"
368,"Let's play! I stream daily from 8 to 12 CST! <3 Come watch me suck at games while finding the hilarity in literally everything.

369,"Hi everyone!!  I'm Billie and I'm starting a Discord server for people interested in gaming and/or toys, as well as people who want to know info about my upcoming livestreams!!

It's mostly channels about gaming or toys, covering specific games and toy brands (e.g. Uncharted or Build-A-Bear) but sometimes wider topics (e.g. dating sims or 18-inch dolls), and even unrelated/semi-related topics, like food or cosplay

For now I'm only handing out invite codes that eventually expire bc I am a lil babby server owner and am afraid of taking on too many folks at once, so sorry if this is expired when someone goes to use it (DM me if so)

370,"Hi folks, I'm [SpaceWitch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSZCo3kRBtyVb-jDdS4jV8A), I play weird and scary games on YouTube. Haven't been for very long, but I have a few good series out, like Fran Bow and Little Misfortune, Detention, Oxenfree, and I'm currently playing Sally Face. So if you're interested in indie games with good scares and good stories, that's what I do!"
371,"According to the wiki Groucho is a Cranky villager, so he must be rather pessimistic, but in NL not even the Cranky villagers are mean, that's why he probably means something like ""It's an awful day, but you're still in one piece, so that's good."""
372,Yeah that makes sense. It's still a funny thing to say though.
373,I’ve been wanting to get an 8BitDo for the Switch. I wonder if any of their controllers would work for you?
374,I’ve struggled terribly with the Xbox one controller and the smallest controller I’ve used is the switch joycons followed by the PS4 controller (which is actually smaller than the PS3 controller in use)
375,"I’m pretty sure Xbox made a mini controller for the xbone. Maybe give that a shot? I can’t speak to the quality though, I have pretty tiny hands but normal controllers work fine for me for whatever reason.

Edit: there’s also this one on amazon 

https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-X91-Wired-Gaming-Controller-Windows/dp/B01N4PCTV4/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1542285332&sr=8-6&keywords=hyperkin+xbox+one"
376,I just got a PDP faceoff deluxe+ to play games on steam since it has a usb adapter. I have small hands and it's a very nice shape.
377,Ooh thats a good idea. I just looked up 8BitDo and you can buy a USB adapter so that you can use the controllers on PC. Their controllers look pretty small so they might work out. Thanks :)
378,I actually found the PS4 controller to be larger because of the touchpad in the middle. I swear I remember there being loads of controllers made for kids but now I'm looking I can't seem to find any.
379,"I looked into the Xbone mini controller and I can't find any that are official :(

The hyperkin contoller looks like it could work but I can only find it in the UK for £60 ($74 ish). I'll keep looking though. Thanks for your suggestions! :)"
380,I think I've tried a similar switch controller before and found it too bulky. Thanks for the suggestion though :)
381,"It’s physically larger but the joysticks are easier to reach for me. 🤷🏻‍♀️  I agree there is a lack of small controllers, I really enjoyed the switch joycons with the grip but I can’t find anything like it."
382,Oof that is pricy. I wish I had better suggestions :/ I hope you find something decent and not too expensive!
383,"I hope you find one, I know it can be risky buying different ones without being able to test them out, especially with small hands!"
384,Thanks so much :)
385,Adorable!
386,"Damn, nice work! Thanks for sharing."
387,Oooh they look nice. How about a daisy one?
388,"the codes are the pink letters/numbers under the dress? I just selected a spot for the tailor's shop today, so I'm getting excited about clothes!"
389,Is there a good place where people are sharing design codes? I'd love to get in on this action!!
390,Ah soooo cute! I can’t do pixel art to save my life lol
391,I can try a Daisy one when I get a chance but someone on /r/ACQR sr did one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACQR/comments/fm7wj3/made_a_princess_daisy_dress/)! I don't think I could top that one.
392,Yeah the ones under the dresses :)
393,I've seen them mostly on /r/ACQR
394,"I've heard a lot about the mount and blade games, I'll keep an eye on this until I have more money, I just bought a few games. \^\^ Thanks for the recommendation!"
395,"Mount and blade 2: Bannerlords  


A really interesting game with RPG and Tactical elements from the perspective of a single character."
396,I was watched someone's stream today and yes the game looks amazing.
397,"Agreed!  I watched Bannerlord played by my favorite streamer literally all day yesterday and it was a blast! I have never played a game like this before but it looks so good that I want to try it on the easiest difficulty, though I am waiting a bit because I already got Animal Crossing for Switch this month, haha. 

If you're curious, [the streamer](https://www.twitch.tv/smokindank5280) will probably be playing a lot of this every day for a long time. He's a married stay-at-home dad to a 9 year old son, works hard, is chill, funny, and weed friendly. I've been a sub for over 2 years now (even my mom subs to him, no joke, lol) and if you're interested in this game, he deserves a look at least :)"
398,No worries it's supposed to be 10% off on steam until 13. April
399,It really is. I haven't gotten too far into the game but I love how open it is and I know some people are disappointed that it's just more or less the same game with just more details but that's honestly just what I wanted it to be.
400,Totally understandable :) I luckily played the other ones but I can totally see how scary it can be to jump into.
401,Derek Lynch just wants to sexually harass and intimidate little kids. Who are we to take that away from him?!
402,"Everytime someone complains about ""being punished for trash talking"" in video games I'm like. Yeah? You're being an asshole? Why do you want to be seen as an asshole? If you're making other people miserable with how you act, you deserve to get booted out of the game."
403,"When I grew up I had some pretty tough times, I've lived tough places and done tough things, but you'd never know that from my personality and demeanor...

I think most people who try to act tough all the time are really little scared babies inside. 

I think anybody that thinks a video game chatroom is tough and seem like it's the toughest place are absolute wankers and the second they face real adversity like poverty, discrimination (racial, sexual, lifestyle, gender etc.) they would not have the maturity or resilience to not comlletely piss themselves and run home to mommy. 

Basically these guys are pasty milquetoast losers who act tuff when their audience is other children, but wouldnt make it a second IRL."
404,"Reminded me this commercial and the drama it caused amongst men

https://youtu.be/koPmuEyP3a0"
405,"Wow... the ""good old days"" when they were even more toxic and abusive then they are now."
406,"I'm trans and my voice doesn't pass perfectly.

I got on voice comms in Overwatch precisely one day in which I was called:

f**got

tr**ny

tr*p

told to kill myself

And then in one game I passed pretty well and was called:

a dumb bitch

a whore

and one guy said he'd love to ""make [me] pregnant so [I] didn't have so much free time""

And some of those games we were *winning*

I don't play OW anymore because Blizzard, but I avoid voice comms at all cost pretty much now.

Cishet men just shouldn't be allowed voice comms unless they have a clean report record."
407,"Ironic, seeing as how gamers showed how thin skinned they are when the Apex Legend devs called them jerks once."
408,"Honestly I blame the parents of these kids. Whining about being unable to use racial or sexual slurs speaks of parents who either couldn't be bothered to make a non-sociopath out of their kid or they are just as bad as said kid.

Speaking of that actually, MW2 lobbies aside, people were less prone to use sexual assault or denigrating slurs at anyone non Cis white male back then (I'm only 28, but I used to play a lot of games that involved multiple people that weren't shooters and no one ever said shit to me for being a woman)."
409,"People still use the mw2 lobby thing legitimately? I thought it turned into a self aware joke few months back. Jfc, can't really trust people to not praise the days you could be an asshole without accountability."
410,"The lack of self-awareness is hilarious.  Do these dimwits not realize that *they* were the 9-year-olds back in the Halo 3 / MW2 days?

Sorry ""Squeakers"", just because your bullshit is all you've ever known, doesn't mean it was normal or right or how it should be even back then.  You were the collective butt of jokes for a decade."
411,"If a 9 year old has enough common decency to report you, then maybe you're the problem."
412,guys like this will claim 'people are too sensitive' but blow up at being called mayonnaise boy
413,"Honestly, hearing that some some of us have gotten 'soft' gives me hope. It's easy to forget that we have made cultural changes when you are in spaces where the boys' club makes the rules. There are other spaces now too and I am so glad they exist. Maybe we can go ever further. It's a struggle changing what people consider normal, but it's worth fighting for I guess."
414,"Bragging about how trashy your community was isn't actually doing you any favors, bro..."
415,"I totally agree with you but we're at a point right now where it gets a little silly. We have single player games with blocked names and some systems are pretty damn weird with the words they block. For example, the perfectly innocent username I had for BF5 got my messages blocked until I changed it"
416,"Not to mention, trash talking is generally allowed. It's the vulgar shit that isn't."
417,"It reminded of a book I had read in school. ""The lord of the flies"" it wasnt until the children started hiding behind their masks, that all the chaos happened."
418,Agreed. I was seeing so much of this last night on Siege. These guys were using racial slurs because we were Indians
419,"Cisgender female here. I don't even play online really because of the harassment I received playing online. The only online game I've played in recent times is Splatoon 2 because I don't need to use voice comms. 

I'm solely a single player gamer now because at least I don't have to deal with any harassment that way.

To be Frank though, I really don't get it. I'll be 30 this year and have been gaming my whole life. It was actually my mom that got me into gaming as she was a gamer (and still is). So I never saw gaming as a ""man's"" thing because my own mother played and my father never did. I just saw it as a past time thing enjoyable by all.

And then I get older and see all the bashing women and girls who play...like they own it. Like we constantly have to prove that we're gamers, we're worthy of that title. 

I'd like to take this moment to say a big fuck you to anyone who thinks that. Gaming is quite literally for anyone--any gender, any age, any race, any ANYTHING. People like playing games and that's that.

I do hope that one day things get better for all of us. We play games to relax and de-stress from the world, not be bullied and ridiculed and sexualized. I just wish the assholes understood that."
420,I’m sorry that you experienced such vile hate. I stopped wearing my headphones when playing Overwatch (and other games) for that reason. I’m a cisgender female and I’ve been called the same slurs you have by arrogant pricks.
421,"You teach people how to treat you, and gamers have spent the last decade teaching the world that they are children and have to be treated that way.

What happens when your give a child wiggle room? They exploit it. You give them hard and fast rules, because they're spending all their time trying to figure out a way around them.

 Is it unfortunate that James Knight gets flagged in some content filters? No! Don't use your real name in a game. But it has to be way because of the way gamers act, as a general rule.

And since gamers reaction to things like chat filters by throwing temper-tantrum, you should expect more filters and more limitations as gamers continue to highlight the fact that this is how they have to be treated.
 
Imagine how embarrassed developers are, having to spend time on shit like that. Do you think they got into development because they wanted to make filters that stop grown men from acting like children? Imagine how much better games would be if devs didn't have to spend their time preemptively stopping the hordes of ass-wipes that buy their games."
422,Unfortunately that's the way it's going to be until (if ever) people stop trying to abuse other people online. There are still plenty of people who find ways around the rules even when things are strict. So it's a difficult thing to balance.
423,"I never picked that up from that book but that makes total sense, huh ~ what is that old quote ""give a man a mask and you can find out who he really is"""
424,"My girlfriend's apartment is right next to a loudmouth that I can sometimes hear when we're on voip. That dude just yells heinous shit at all hours when he's playing COD or whatever.

They seriously can't be trusted with voice privileges.

Sorry you had to deal with that :("
425,Yea I believe that was said at the end of the actual movie they made by the rescuers. They has set the island on fire if I remember right.
426,"Here's the thing, I have an International Human Rights Law paper due tonight (yes I was procrastinating since January, but that's a different story). I'd finished 2/3rds of it yesterday, foregoing my afternoon nap (I'm getting old you know) and I really needed a break. 
I was tired too and we weren't performing that well
These guys were really annoying us and as much as we were trying to play well, we were all a bit off and we'd played against them in 2 successive matches, both of which we lost 2-3
God they were insufferable!!"
427,I have a heart lake too!
428,"Are those cherries?  I’ve only seen peaches and oranges, and bamboo so far"
429,Thats is the only reason I picked my island lol. Omg this Bunny Day event is so awesome 🐇
430,"Yes they are cherries🍒. I've only seen these and oranges. Waiting for my tent to uprgrade but have to wait 'till tomorrow, I didn't know there was bamboo though."
431,Bamboo is one of the special islands you can visit with a nook ticket it’s random if you get it. I finally got it today and now I have a little bamboo patch on my island :)
432,"Sounds like my dream date lol.

Way too scared to play it myself, but love watching other people play it."
433,Same lol
434,Im... beggiNG YOU. May i have the code for the sweater? 🥺 it’s amazing
435,"If its difficult to do the code thing, could you post the grid designs?"
436,I will look into how to do this and let you know!! I'm still very new to the game and am totally fine sharing. ❤️😊
437,"I can do the grid designs for sure.

We don't have internet capabilities yet..
 So I'm assuming that's out."
438,Thank you!!
439,"Yea, might be. But at least you can do grid design! :)"
440,"Designs https://imgur.com/gallery/TTdPJ0o

Here are the grid designs for both..."
441,"Designs https://imgur.com/gallery/TTdPJ0o

I hope that helps!!!"
442,Thank you!:-)
443,Thanks!
444,Anytime!
445,Anytime!
446,They are super cute. How is the mic quality? I'm debating between this one and the OW Dva headset.
447,I love mien as well. Especially since most over ear headphones give me headaches because they press on my glasses but these don’t unless I wear them for like 14 hours straight... but then again that might be the sleep deprivation lol
448,Hubs just bought a pair of these. They sound beautiful and are so cozy!
449,"I've been told they are on par if not better than the astros I had someone who's had way too many headsets (he's got ten he actively uses now) to recomend these, said that for the price these are definitely better, it's more sensitive as well so you don't have to have it in your face, also the fact it fits into the headset helps a lot if worried about needing to put it somewhere.

My lisp prominency went from 6/10 to apparently 11/10. So it's more accurate to how you sound irl, the mic monitoring feels like I'm talking in a shower rather than a headset so from my end as well sounds as close to the real as possible."
450,"Also, review wise due to placement of mic on the dva headset I wouldn't recommend an omnidirectional mic, it pics up more including the headset audio. BUT, overall, I like razer as a brand, if worse case scenario you can send them back, super cute  tho ^^"
451,Thank you so much. You rock :)
452,I think you may be able to set up an account and do a family link or something. https://store.steampowered.com/promotion/familysharing
453,"This worked out perfectly, thank you a trillion

Only bummer is this account has me at a Level 0 with no hours logged - definite blow to the ego hah 

This better be a life lesson for all the kids out there to never use their real actual last name in any username whatsoever （￣～￣）"
454,Last I checked it's possible to change your Steam username -- why not just do that on the original account?
455,"So it's technically my account name, which the internet is telling me is impossible to change. Changing your profile name on the other hand is easy peasy lemon squeezy.

But I am curious if my account name is there for public consumption, or if it can be kept private.  

Diving back into the Googz now. I'll let you know if I learn anything!"
456,"Welp, looks like account names are private after all. I must secretly enjoy doing hours of unnecessary work hah

Thank you u/besme and u/cassinpants for sticking in there with me  :)"
457,"Yes, AC is sipping the battery out like orange juice. Usually when I unplug it and start playing after I’m done it has either 40 or 60%, depending on how long I’ve played"
458,"Yeah Switch battery life isn’t great, and it varies depending on the game. Also unlike other Nintendo handhelds it still drains battery in sleep mode and off, so you want to keep it docked/charging when you’re not using it."
459,"One thing that helped me reduce battery usage in handheld mode is turning off ""Auto Brightness"" in the settings. I then lowered the brightness a bit to suit the lighting in whatever room I was in. I found the battery seemed to drain a lot less fast after this, but it would still completely drain in about 4 hours, depending on the game I'm playing. I do have the original model Switch though, which is known for having a worse battery. The recent V2 Switch is supposed to have better battery."
460,"Yeah, definitely noticed this too. I have a powerbank that I pretty much keep constantly plugged in so I'm not tethered to an outlet all day."
461,When I played dragon quest builders 2 I only got like 3 hours max playing undocked :( my battery drains quick too
462,"Weird.. I though it would preserve the energy while completely shut down. For a handheld it's pretty bad tbh. If I imagine a long car ride, I would need some powerbanks. 

But anyway, thanks for your answer. Glad it's not a problem with just our Switch!"
463,Thanks for the tip!
464,That's a good idea. I guess I need to charge my powerbanks lol
465,It uses energy at a massively reduced rate so it can keep your games running. So you can just press power and pause the game if you have to put it down.
466,also when playing handheld and don't use online I turn on airplane mode :)
467,"be careful though, the switch needs special outlet. it needs a special voltage. I don't know if that's the correct term but you shouldn't charge it with anything else but the oficial battery and maybe some special powerbanks made for it"
468,I love the eyes!!
469,Thank you!
470,"I looove the vita, so sad it wasn't a very well sold handheld"
471,I love seeing vita posts. It's the little handheld that could at this point. Freaking Sony with the proprietary memory cards.
472,"Never had a vita but my bro did. It really is an amazing and underrated system. So many memories in it!

When we were still kids, my bro rented Sky Cooper 4. There was a code for a free vita copy in the case, and he was able to use it and get the game for free."
473,I haven't played the Vita in probably a year or two. The Switch has kinda taken all my time in the handheld department. Still always cool to see a fellow Vita owner.
474,"I mostly use my Vita for playing classic JRPGs. It has an amazing library. I'll probably still be playing it for several years at least. The list of games I want to play on it is long! 

I also feel the same way about my 3DS. I have a Switch but there's still a lot of great titles I haven't gotten around to playing yet on my 3DS.

I love having a variety of handheld consoles to play. :)"
475,I still have my vita and a backlog. I’m still sad that it wasn’t more popular and my 3ds graphics look so poor in comparison.
476,"Definitely - I feel like it walked so the switch could run, though. Maybe if Sony hadn't done what they did with memory cards, it would have lasted a tiny bit longer.

I actually got mine when they were comparitively dirt cheap and basically rebuilt it from the ground up, hence the funky color scheme (and the 256GB micro SD built into the console via the former 3G port thanks to the work of a couple of guys on /r/vitahacks, because I want space but also my game carts lol). I definitely don't regret a second spent with it."
477,"Omg lol. I had to sell mine recently. I plan to get another eventually so dude did not get a single one of my memory cards. 

I also accidentally ordered two for my bf a couple years ago for christmas. We were gonna send one back because we couldn't *really* afford it but the temptation to keep two was way too real. Obviously we kept it. 😂"
478,"The memory cards are the worst, most likely the reason the console failed as you said..

I got mine used for less than 100 bucks and I'm really glad it's still working this fine! Also got some used memory cards. I could never rebuild stuff like this, would be too anxious in ruining something lol"
479,I can't say I blame you. I bought a second one a while ago specifically to hack it and have it connected to my Japanese account to try some Japanese game demos and maybe get something from the store but I haven't gone about doing that just yet.
480,Cute! Can I ask if the case makes it feel bulky? I’m thinking of getting one but I love the slim feel so idk if I should.
481,So cute!
482,I just got the same skin lol!
483,"Thank you 💕 The case does make it feel bulky ngl, but it’s something I’m okay with since I feel like my lite is being protected. If you don’t have butterfingers like me I’m sure you’ll be fine without the case. I’m think you can find cases on Etsy or Amazon that are more light weight. This is the official Nintendo one btw."
484,Aww I’m glad you’ll get yours as well 💕😊
485,"Mine is the orangey-tan version, I got it 2 days ago and put it on, it’s so nice"
486,"Ahh I was actually thinking about getting that one, but I wanted the cute pink paw thumb grips. I bet your switch looks very cute and warm😭💕"
487,"I got yellow and pink paw grips to go with it omg!!! 😂 When the grips come in I’ll pop them on and show you, we’ll have twin switches"
488,Aww girl please do that would be so cute!!! I waited too long so the grips are sold out so I’m just waiting patiently. But I would love to see yours💕
489,I’ll keep you updated!
490,Sounds good! I also have discord if you wanted to keep in touch 😊
491,"Right now, I’m taking a break from rdr2 to play uncharted 4. I think I needed it because I DO want to finish the former’s story, but I lost all my game saves when I was in chapter 6, restarted with a new game and cheated to get fancy ponies (I deserve them!!), finished all the satchel upgrades ... and realized by george I really had no desire to find dreamcatchers, fossils, and carvings AGAIN. I’m not even sure I’m up for redoing the side missions right now, so I’ll see how I feel after playing something else for a bit. 

Also trying not to spend all my money on sims 4 dlc just for building dumb things I think are funny."
492,"Just started Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, which is my first taste of a game that relies more so on forming a group to complete quests. Other than the constant reminder of not having virtual friends, it's a really entertaining game.

Otherwise, I've put a lot of time into: 

* Thief Simulator
* Two Point Hospital ^((reminiscent of Theme Hospital))
* No Man's Sky

Hope this helps! :)"
493,"I personally haven't had too much time to play recently (school fml), but these games are very easy to get sucked into, great for passing time:

**Terraria** 

Stardew Valley

The Sims 4

Skyrim"
494,If you haven't played Tlou or Bloodborne on PS4 they are both excellent games! Right now I am currently playing The Witcher 3 though and it is amazing.
495,"I’m doing yet another play through of Dragon Age Inquisition naively hoping that I’ll finally achieve 100% completion in regards to all the branching choices.

On the side playing Monster Hunter casually, because I have no online friends to carry my bum through missions.

Apart from that:
A lot of grand strategy games! 
Civilization V, Endless Space 2 and Endless Legend. ‘Just one more turn’ syndrome isn’t a bad thing for once.

Finishing a lot of Jrpgs I abandoned at mid-end game!
Tales of Berseria and Tales of Vesperia especially.

Subnautica on the PC because I like to frighten myself, and of course. League of Legends because addiction is real.

I hope you find something you enjoy in this time!!"
496,"I recently finished Dragon Age: Origins and Final Fantasy I: Anniversary Edition (I'm slowly working through FF1 to 6 on the Vita). 

Now I'm playing Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on Master Mode for the first time. This is my second playthrough, I haven't played it since the launch three years ago. So enough time has passed for it to feel fresh again. I wanted to do one more playthrough with the DLC additions this year since BotW 2 will probably be coming out next year. I'm enjoying it a lot so far, the harder difficulty forces me to strategise more before fighting enemies. It's tense but fun! Exploring is really relaxing when there's no enemies around though!

I'm also playing Rune Factory 4 Special on the side."
497,Mass Effect Andromeda after replaying the trilogy last year. I always leave at least a two year break between replays.

So basically I feel really connected and friendly w the ghosts now :) am sosososo grateful for this place"
551,Its half life 1
552,"I think for me, it’s moreso bad when they have no other characterization than being a sex symbol, or if there isn’t male objectification as well. If things are equal, or if they are treated like real characters, then I wouldn’t feel too bad about it!"
553,"This is the epitome of the 'lesbian brain v feminist brain' meme, at least for me, lol. 

So the thing is, I enjoy female characters that are attractive, and I don't *mind* having boob armor or cool sexy clothes *as an option*. But I play gw2 and I hate starting out a game as an elementalist or a mesmer because the starting outfits are weird and floofy and revealing and I feel like that's an indication of the devs' lack of respect for the characters, if that makes sense, so I'm not a big fan of that at all. But if someone *wanted* to go out and search for boob armor for some reason-- which I usually don't, since my clothing aesthetic tends more towards 'ladies in armor/sensible leather with sword'-- I don't mind that choice being there."
554,"Hmm I'm bi but I find that what's meant to be attractive to straight men isn't necessarily attractive to me, not to the same extent at least. While not immune to canonical beauty standards and common forms of sexualization, I've noticed that, in general, wlw's idea of what makes a woman sexy doesn't always match with that of straight men."
555,It's weird but I am cool with sexualised characters if they at least give them an interesting design.
556,"I guess for me it depends on:

Are the characters two or three dimensional in the game.

Like characters can be hot (regardless of gender Identity) but if their whole character arc is basically nothing more than a ""sex object"" to please a certain kind of audience, then I'm like: Nah, not really what I like at the very least. Characters can have sexual undertones in my opinion, but please for the sake of whatever give them a character beside that, instead of them solely being put into the game for fanservice aspects."
557,"I love girl characters with big boobs/sexual undertones too! And I don’t think there’s anything inherently wrong or bad about that. 

When it’s used solely for male pleasure though, and the character doesn’t have any personality or soul outside of being a sex object, that’s when it pisses me off. Like their whole personality is: be beautiful. It’s pretty clear when the audience is supposed to see her as a person or as an object, and the latter is extremely gross and offensive. I don’t know how to describe it, but I’m sure we all feel it- that intensely disgusted feeling when a woman is objectified. 

I think bayonetta is an example of the good kind. Fights in high heels, is super sexy, big ole tiddies, but she also is the star of the game, has personality and autonomy and isn’t just there to feed a fantasy. And Eva from MGS. And Fiona from haunting ground. 

They all have big old boobies, and actually have an impact on the story."
558,"I relate to this! I find myself gravitating towards sexy outfits for my female characters in games as well. Like others have stated I think a large part of it does hinge on whether the character exists solely as an object for sexual pleasure versus possessing complexity, hence effectively making the sexuality a  component of their personality rather than a sole defining factor.

I'm also of the mind that female sensuality and sexuality when embraced and leveraged correctly can be a great source of empowerment so it may be those beliefs seeping into my aesthetic choices in games."
559,"You can be sexy and badass.  A lot of people forget this when talking about these characters.  A lot of the time, yeah, it's obvious it was just meant for the character to be oogled at (like the original ps1 Lara Croft).  But some characters, like Lulu is both.  You can admire her beauty while she black magicks you to oblivion.  

It's a cheap tactic to get in the views and men buying it, buuuutttt I don't think thats necessarily a bad thing.  When it's done in poor taste, yeah that's bad.  But you shouldn't feel bad liking that kind of thing.  If you throw a fit when a game doesn't do that, then you might want to rethink your values.  

Also: Tifa.  I'm more of a Aerith girl, but Tifa is also fantastic :)"
560,"I mean, I feel like wlw have this thing where they feel ashamed of their attraction towards women and are afraid they'll be seen as predatory. You can see straight women posting here about how hot some male characters are, why would you feel ashamed to feel the same for female characters? 

I think the difference is that those male gamers we don't want to associate with think this is the ONLY type of female character that is ""allowed"" to exist. That's the mindset that is toxic. Not the attraction per-se, but the entitlement. Something you, as a wlw, not a man, doesn't have."
561,"Like others have said, I have no issue with sexy female characters that actually have personalities, and perhaps are dressed that way for a reason (eg. Confidence). But it's _really_ obvious in games when sexy women are just there for the straight male gaze and have no relevance to the story, and they sometimes also speak in what I like to call the ""Catwoman Voice"" (Batman) because no one actually talks like that.... Another trope I hate is bikini armour just to show off a woman's body but it's so impractical you may as well be naked. :P

Anyways I've played plenty of games with sexy women that I like because they actually have personalities and relevance to the plot and don't feel like just eye candy. Some examples:

* Velvet from Tales of Vesperia
* Morrigan from Dragon Age: Origins
* Yennifer and Triss from The Witcher 3
* Tifa from Final Fantasy VII
* Milla from Tales of Xillia

I think women can be very sexy without being scantily clad though. I would like to see less objectification in games, and more development of women as characters in games. I have no problems with the women being sexy, but I'd like to see it done in different ways than always opting for the ""big boobs, scantily clad"" look. Granted, I feel games have gotten a lot better for this kind of thing nowadays but there's still work to be done. (Eg. We have Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey, she isn't your typical ""straight male gaze"" definition of sexy lady, but she's very sexy. Her muscles in particular are very popular amongst women I've noticed. This is an example of a sexy character that isn't designed with the straight male gaze in mind. And it's a brilliant design! I'd like to see more variety with sexy women in games like this.)"
562,"I think for some characters (Bayonetta comes to mind for me) what I love about them isn't that they are sexy, it's that they own that sexuality. Some characters are sexy for themselves and some characters are definately sexy just for the player and for me the ones that are like yeah I'm sexy what about it? Are the ones that I really enjoy. Are they still objectified by players? Yes. But I find their sexiness less disagreeable when it's not just some incidental thing and is instead something the character chooses and wants."
563,"Yeah, I feel this too.

You might be interested in some of what Katherine Cross has written about Bayonetta: [https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/276741/Opinion\_Being\_sexy\_and\_not\_sexist\_\_a\_look\_at\_Bayonetta\_and\_objectification.php](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/276741/Opinion_Being_sexy_and_not_sexist__a_look_at_Bayonetta_and_objectification.php)"
564,"Dude, yep. Lulu, Tifa, Fran, Paine, Sheva, Jill Valentine, Widowmaker. Though it's not really boobs or attraction for me (hetero here), it's the fashion and way that they hold themselves.

I think it's because they represent women who can be badass, tough, and smart, but also sexy at the same time.

When these characters are designed, (probably) by men, they probably aren't intended to be that way, but that is how I perceive them as characters and as women, so they're going to be both badass and sexy and it's okay.

Because honestly, who doesn't want to be both IRL?"
565,"This is a place for women to express their hobbies for video games. You shouldn't be down-voted we all have our personal opinions and taste. Anyway as for as sexy video game characters, why is it so wrong to like sexy video game characters? Because some people said so? You don't have to be repulsed because other people are. Don't try to retrain your brain and enjoy the characters you like."
566,"don't think there is a ""should"", attraction is also different from fetishization !"
567,"Ahh, I get what you mean! Some people would call it desensitization from almost a decade of playing jrpgs, and it IS true that female character design considers ‘marketability’ (aka hee hoo straight male gaze) the core part of their aesthetic.

But that doesn’t mean that all of them are ‘just’ a sexy design! I love, LOVE Lulu too because it all comes together into a picture of elegance - like, there’s her on the outside, and then there’s her on the inside, and it all comes together to form the Lulu we know and love.

ajsldjd sorry I’m having trouble expressing myself. What I think I’m trying to say is that, you love these characters for their - well, characters. It’s who they are outside of their physical design. The male gaze is finding an interest and liking a character simply for the fact that she is female and/or is sexually attractive. They see the gender and then they stop. 

It’d never be a moral dilemma for them. It’s like a subconscious expectation that all female characters will be designed with them in mind 90% of the time. But that doesn’t mean /we/ can’t enjoy these characters too, or that our enjoyment is for exactly the same reasons. Keep on loving Lulu and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!!"
568,That makes sense. Thanks for your perspective.
569,"I'm not familiar with the meme you are referencing, but it sounds amusing."
570,Me too! Like Lulu from FFX. I love her belt dress and Moogle doll. I also love how she hides health potions in her boobs. Makes me wanna be a health potion. ;)
571,Makes sense to me. :)
572,"That is very true. One question: how can we tell if it is for male pleasure? Like when Lulu sticks her glorious marshmallowy soft mammaries into the camera, one could say it is solely for male pleasure. But I like it too, and am not a guy. So, what distinguishes a sexualized moment as being just for men."
573,"I think that is how I feel too, actually. Just couldn't find the words to describe it."
574,"You make very good points.

And for me, re: Lulu and the rest, it is all about the boobs. And dem thighs."
575,Thank you so much! <3
576,Probably this one?  [https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/9whzo7/feminist\_brain\_vs\_lesbian\_brain/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/9whzo7/feminist_brain_vs_lesbian_brain/)
577,"I think the distinguishing factor can be is it done respectively? I am currently thinking about two wlw films, Blue is the Warmest Colour and A Portrait of a Lady on Fire (both well regarded French films depicting queer ladies in a romance). They both have sex scenes, and where BITWC is basically pornographic, APOALOF has pure sensuality. Where I’m going with this is that BITWC was directed by a man, and APOALOF by a woman. Just something to think about."
578,"I wish I had an easy answer, but it’s hard to describe and the line is different for everyone. There’s no like, set rule, it’s pretty subjective. So if you like it, I think that’s totally fine. A girl should have her own say in what’s okay/not to her. I never played final fantasy, but just by looking at the character, her perfect marshmallow boobies aren’t the sole focus of her character. Maybe used as a gag but it’s not the only reason she’s around.  I mean, at the end of the day, women can’t help being beautiful and I think almost everyone likes boobs. So it’s not a bad thing to show that. 

When a female character’s sole purpose is to be there so that guys have some tits and ass to look at, and she never does or says anything, and her entire value is placed on her looks, to me that feels like the generations-long idea of women being nothing more than objects or consumable goods. But like someone else said, if there are men treated in the same way in-game, I think it balances it out. Like in Detroit Become Human, there were both male and female sex robots lol. So it didn’t feel weird."
579,eww
580,"For what it's worth I don't actually think this idea applies to Lulu for example. It's OK to like her for being sexy, but I think the lack of sensible justification for her outfit especially when compared with what everyone else was wearing on that game made her feel out of place with her sexiness. I actually feel like final fantasy games in general are pretty bad about having the one fan service character who doesn't really have a sensible character reason to be sexy and I tend to find those characters sort of off putting because of it(Cindy in FF15 is another example) . FF fan service  characters rarely in my opinion own their sexuality the same way Bayonetta or for another example Moxie(borderlands) do."
581,"Ah, thanks!"
582,"Thanks for the link, made my day!"
583,"Ah, I see!"
584,That makes perfect sense! Thank you.
585,You're welcome.
586,You're welcome. It's a classic.
587,"This was pretty awesome.

Did you get any reaction from them?"
588,"I went and checked, surprisingly they didn't blow the signs up yet! 😂 They tried to kill me and bombed more of the base trying to look for hidden loot again, and a third clan tried blowing up one of my lower grade bases which is hilarious. The signs are staying, at this point I think they've realized it's pointless to continue raiding since they will be expending more resources than they'd get from the raid hahah. Also, they attempted to drop some garbage loot from my roof down to their guy on the ground, but they didn't realize that I was the one standing there. So I legit snatched even more from their loot take.

 This is hilarious. Honestly I just wanted to make sure the loot didn't go to the bad guys, and I wanted to save my clanmates horse he raised from the start who saved us so many times including helping him defend the base while I was in surgery. While he was asleep, I returned his horse from the island I hid her on to where his character has a bedroom somewhere safe. I put her a little haystack and a note welcoming her home. Granted this is in his bedroom but hey I saved the horse! Just waiting for him to wake up and see her. He was so sad thinking she was gone. So this is a win for me definitely. I expected hate mail for the poem, but I haven't received any lmfao. They definitely went looking for more loot in response, but they haven't bombed the signs. 😂😂😂😂"
589,I've never played modded Minecraft. I've seen soo many good mods but I get overwhelmed so I end up not installing anything.
590,"Does the version matter? The last modpack I liked that I played with FTB Revelations but it's on an older version of the game.

Haven't found a good recent modpack yet, though I haven't really been looking."
591,"I've only played vanilla so far but there are some really interesting mods I've seen LDShadowLady use in her videos that I want to try someday, if I ever figure out how."
592,"I love Pam‘s Harvest craft! She is currently working on bringin it out for 1.15.2
Lots of lots of different vegetables, fruits, cooking equipment and recipes to eat. Perfect for deep tavern rp :3"
593,"I compiled a long list of mods for a friend last year consisting of a million different animal/wild life and biomes mods, along with a few magic mods.

I think thematic idea was something like ‘witches, but they’re zookeepers at the same time.’ I watched Seri’s zoocrafting series a long time ago and really wanted to do the same, I think. But it’s definitely not for everyone if you’re not.. as animal crazed."
594,"I like Roguelike Adventures and Dungeons, but Crackpack 3 has been fun recently."
595,My computer can’t really run mods but I got the uwucraft texture pack lol. I like it but it Definitely seems half finished to me.
596,"I was in the same boat! There's a new mod pack (I'll find it and link it later) that's aimed at beginners. It just has some basic, but awesome, mods in it and supposedly does s great job and slowly introducing new players to it without being too terribly overwhelming."
597,"Nope! I don't think version matters. Revelations was fun! There's so many modpacks now, it's ridiculous."
598,"Vanilla is good! For me, it's personally pretty hard to play vanilla after playing modded for so long. I might be able to help you if you ever want to take that leap!"
599,I forgot about Pam's! I love Pam's too! So much food and fun things to make!
600,I'll have to give those a look! I like trying new packs.
601,I actually haven't played with any texture packs before! Are they easy to use?
602,FTB Academy? It's the only one I can think of right now that it's aimed to beginners so you can learn about some mods.
603,Do you like tech or magic mods more? Most packs focus on one or the other.
604,I definitely may end up taking you up on that! I spend more time watching YouTubers play Minecraft now than I do actually playing it because it's all sort of routine. It's amazing how mods can drastically change the game.
605,Hope you have fun. I have a server for Crackpack 3 but everyone stopped playing on it.
606,They are. I just downloaded the texture pack (it’s a zip file) and then in Minecraft (in the game under resource packs or something like that) there’s a button that open the folder you have to put it in. And then it’s there and ready to use. You can pick and choose between them in Minecraft
607,That's the one!
608,"So, I tend to really like tech stuff, but I'm not very good at it. I like some magic mods (still cannot for the life of me wrap my head around Thaumcraft though). I really enjoy mods that focus on exploration and I love me a quest book. I also like the grindy-ness of expert packs. That's why I enjoy Dungeons Dragons and Space Shuttles so much. It's got a good mix of tech and magic, plenty of exploration and combat (and scary ass cockatrices)."
609,Absolutely! Just PM me and I can set up a discord room or something to help you out!
610,"Thank you!

And that sucks that everyone stopped playing."
611,"That sounds super simple, I'll have to give that a shot! Texture packs makes things look different, right?"
612,"Have you ever tried all the mods 3? Another older pack but has a decent mix of those.

There is an all the mods 4 now I believe but I have not played it."
613,Yeah. Not the first time that's happened to me. I wish I had a consistent group of friends to play games with.
614,Yup. A lot of them have shaders so look out for that as it’s pretty hard on the computer.
615,Yup. A lot of them have shaders so look out for that as it’s pretty hard on the computer.
616,"I might have. I honestly don't remember. Right now, I only have DDSS and Life in the Village sitting in my MultiMC. I might have played ATM at some point, as well as a smattering of Skyblock packs. I'll have to give the ATM pack a look and see if the mods look good to me!"
617,"I'm in the same boat. I only really have my husband, and he's into FPS and VR games (I'm not really a fan of either). I tend to enjoy more relaxed games (Minecraft, stardew valley, Pokemon and the like)."
618,I didn't know that was a thing. I'll keep an eye out. Thank you!

646,"Thank you! I really like all 3 aesthetics so I'm glad I could put them all in  😊 

I used this case from Amazon: [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F8768FD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)

It's the crystal clear variant! It's a hard case so it was easier to put the behind stickers in while still maintaining their position. For the joycons I had to stick the stickers on though, so I opted for the washi-tape like stickers."
647,"Ooh that’s a good idea actually! Bc Then I can swap em out whenever I want to. Thanks :) 

I was thinking about getting the gray cons so that way it’ll be plain enough to not clash with decals or stickers. So it should be fine on that front."
648,"I got that idea from my friend who does the same thing but with her phone and ipad cases. It's pretty neat! I think grey joycons are great, that being said they are the same price as other colours (at least on Amazon), so if you have your eye on other colours to match your stickers, go for it! I hope you have fun decorating your switch   😊   😊"
649,Who are your fav villagers and why? :D
650,Charlise is in my New Horizons town!
651,Omg yay!!! Cherish her 🐻
652,I will! :)
653,"Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a good one if you enjoy open world exploration games. It is set in a post-apocalyptic, empty-ish world though so if you prefer games that give you more direction and that have more characters it may not be for you. If you're not into this, maybe you'd like Link's Awakening, which is based on the classic 2D style Zelda games. It's a fairly short game by today's standards, but still a lot of fun.

Super Mario Odyssey is a great 3D platformer. There's also Spyro, A Hat in Time, and Super Lucky's Tale (this has an eshop demo).

For RPGs, Fire Emblem: Three Houses is a great strategy RPG with great story, characters, and tons of content. I also like Tales of Vesperia, Dragon Quest XI (this has an eshop demo), and Ni no Kuni. Divinity Original Sin 2, The Witcher 3, Skyrim, and Dragon's Dogma are also great RPG choices.

If you want more relaxing/social sim type games like Animal Crossing, then Rune Factory 4 Special is a great choice. It's a mix of farming sim/RPG. There's also My Time at Portia, which is very much like Stardew, but focuses on crafting. Lastly, Dragon Quest Builders 2 is a fun relaxing game, it's a building sim/RPG. I enjoyed it a lot. There's an eshop demo.

Then of course there's the NES/SNES games you get free with the Nintendo online membership. My personal favourites are Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Mario World, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. There's a lot you can try."
654,SSBU
655,"This game rec is way out of my comfort zone for genre, and it might also be out of yours? That said, I picked it up due to it looking really charming and I'm actually hooked!!

One Step From Eden. It just came out. It's a deck-building, roguelike action game with Femme Protagonists. 

Otherwise, Child of Light is a really charming turn-based combat, RPG, Femme Protagonist game that is also pretty nice :)"
656,Mario
657,You might like Saints Row the 3rd. It's like GTA but more absurd which makes it a hilarious game.
658,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate this! I'll definitely watch some gameplay of the games mentioned and see if they're for me"
659,Thanks!
660,Thank you! I haven't heard of these so I will definitely check them out
661,Time to get Pokemon and Animal Crossing on Switch!
662,New Leaf is so much fun that even after starting New Horizons I’d check in on my New Leaf town!
663,"I loved New Leaf! Have fun playing, New Horizons will be there when you're ready 😊"
664,The switch was probably the best investment I’ve ever made! New Horizons is life!
665,Heeey are you me? That's me right now. Switch is sold out no matter where I look so I'm stuck with ACNL.
666,Good luck on getting one. Theyre sold out everywhere. :( I planned to use the stimulus check coming in from US Govt to get a switch except I cant find any anywhere.
667,yaaay! new leaf is so amazing! ;o;
668,"Girl, yes! Didn't enjoy Pokémon gen 8 that much, but ACNH is soulfood."
669,New leaf is great. I would also recommend monster hunter stories if you like pokemon. I never played a monster hunter game before but really enjoyed it.
670,I have been doing the same thing!
671,"I definitely will be. With difficult Financial Times with Covid currently happening, I can’t just spontaneously spend money... but soon, I will have one!"
672,Oh nice! I can’t wait to get further into it! I’m really enjoying it so far
673,"So far, it’s so so good! Only played a few days. 
But ye, I’m excited for that!"
674,"It’s so good to hear lots of positive things about to switch because I do really want one! Everyone’s just making me want one more, I can’t wait haha"
675,"Hey, y’know I feel your pain. It gives me an excuse to actually play NL and not just jump straight to NH😪"
676,"Yeah, I’m definitely going to have to wait. Especially with Covid stopping everything. I might even have to wait a few months :("
677,It is! I’m loooving it so far!
678,"Aha! Yeah, I don't know anything further on from games.. the new generation i just haven't bothered with yet because I haven't played any of sword or shield. My favourite games is ORAS so i tend to stick to them!   
Urgh i can't wait to get it haha"
679,"Ah awesome! I’ll have to check it out, thankyou!"
680,It’s great!
681,"I played my new leaf town for well over a year. Like I played every single day. It’s a great game. Don’t rush into the new title, enjoy what you have and when you are ready, “new horizons” will be waiting for you heh ;)"
682,"Yes it’s so much fun! If you want other fruit to plant let me know, I think I have all of them. Have fun!"
683,Hell yea~ I started redecorating my town and ACNL is still a ton of fun to play.
684,Looking forward to hearing your opinion when you played it 😊
685,Agreed. I got on the bandwagon for New Leaf pretty late and it was still so much fun. And actually getting in on release can be kinda stressful because you feel “behind” if you didn’t do all the things right away. It’s okay to take your time.
686,"Yeah, its great just to be able to pick it up whenever I have spare time and just do some little bits, i don't feel like I NEED to complete anything haha"
687,"That’s awesome!  Can you still see other people’s towns on NL? I’m guessing you need the WiFi service, but is it outdated now? I hadn’t been on my 3DS for a while since before I got ACNL"
688,Haha thankyou! I will update!
689,"Oh yeah definitely!   
The only game i've bough that was on release day was Pokemon Moon and because I was working full time and doing other things like drawings, I felt like i lost time on it and a lot of my friends got a hell of a lot further through it before I did. But I agree, It's better to take your time with games and just be content with it."
690,"Yea it’s a very stress free game. I think what makes animal crossing sort of stand out as a series is the fact that a lot of what you do is driven by your emotions, not excitement and adventure like in other games. Like watering flowers, visiting villagers, creating a cozy home and town... it’s all just emotionally driven and not really “necessary”. Really makes you appreciate these things in real life too (life imitates art, after all)"
691,You still can!
692,"Yes, exactly! And New Leaf is such a great game there is no harm in enjoying it. I hope when things turn around you’ll get a chance to get a switch, but there’s no rush! Gaming is a lifelong hobby :)"
693,"Yeah exactly! It’s super cool. 
Yessss!"
694,That so awesome yesssss
695,Yessss! What a lovely way of putting it!
696,"I have the games on Steam, I've played a little bit of IL-2 Sturmovik: 1942 BAT mod, but haven't played the most recent game Battle of Stalingrad—though I do own it and most of the expansions. I'd be willing to play with you!  
There is supposedly a co-op mod for Battle of Stalingrad, so we could play a co-op campaign together.  
It's nice to find another woman into these kind of games!"
697,"Hi! That’s awesome! I have Battle of Stalingrad and the expansions. I didn’t know there was a co-op campaign mod for it, that would be quite fun. I’m still learning how to get to grips with engine management and navigation.
It is really nice too! I seem to vastly outnumbered by the dudes playing it!
I’m super into WWII planes, I’m actually going to do my phd on them!"
698,"I'm pretty new to these games as well, so I'm probably on your level, we could totally practice together. I noticed in your post history that you also build scale models of WWII planes, that's really cool. I've built a few scale models myself, but of modern jets, a tank, and a ship. Do you use Discord? We could use that to chat if you want. I'll also send you a PM with my Steam info so you can add me."
699,"That's great! It would be lovely to have someone to practice with! I love to build models, it's my little moment of zen :) I am running out of space to put them these days though!
I have a discord account, I just have to remember what it is and reinstall it. I haven't used it in ages."
700,"Hey! Happy late birthday, and congrats! For the colors, it is after all up to your preferences, the bottom right looks super cool imo. All of them look great though."
701,I personally like the purple and orange one best. Purple is and awesome colour and the orange compliments it quite well. My second choice would be the monochromatic blue.
702,I like the all blue ones!
703,Why not a pink with purple or a blue with purple? :)
704,purple and yellow for sure! 🍋🍇
705,"Happy birthday!! They all look nice, but I'm just in love with the purple/orange one. I'm thinking about buying them for myself. I think the combination of these colours is pretty unique, but it goes really well. 

Enjoy playing!"
706,Bottom right is what I use! I love purple & orange!
707,No ones said it yet but I like the red / red combo! I always gravitate towards my matching set.
708,I would pick blue and orange (not shown).
709,I think the blue looks best
710,2 orange if you can. Otherwise 2 blue.
711,I have the purple and orange and they are so bright in person! Love them.
712,I like the purple and orange!
713,Pink and purple or purple and blue... or pink and blue
714,My favorite color is blue but that lower right combo looks very promising!
715,"Hmm, I have grey joycons only so this is a lot of choices :). Personally, I'd go with purple and blue, but of the 4 pictured, I like the double blue."
716,The purple with orange looks so nice 😍
717,Personally I like the all red because red is my favorite color but I also like the purple and orange because it reminds me of Spyro.
718,Purple and orange looks nice.
719,"Thanks! I'm leaning toward the purple and orange as well, but something draws me to monochrome colours too and the symmetry they entail 😁"
720,Thanks! That's actually my order of preference too. If only that had dual purple joycons! 🤷‍♀️😁
721,Thanks!!! That's a top contender!
722,"Very solid options,  but not my top choices. I tested all options and these were my top 4 😁"
723,Hehehe soooooo cool! 💜💛
724,Thanks!  It's a hard decision. I totally Louvre the orange/purple combo as well!! 💜🧡
725,Same! My hubby and I share joycons so  either I get the dual red and he gets the dual blues or vice versa 😁♥️♥️
726,Thanks! 💙
727,Oh man I'd love to orange. I don't think it's possible tho..
728,I know! Decision is so hard I almost want to keep all the joycons!!!
729,Yes! So nice.  I'll take option E. All of the above!haha
730,All great options!  That little pop of colour makes a world of difference!
731,I know.  So hard to choose.  I almost want to keep both and use whichever ones complement my current mood lol 😊
732,"I thought the purple and blue would be good together, but it was a little too dark and I wanted a pop of colour. I think I'm gonna go with double blue 😊"
733,I know. I love it! But I decided to go with dual blue so hubby could have dual pink.  Maybe next birthday I'll get a spare set 😊
734,"Gonna use this! Lol

""Less misogyny more practice. Git gud scrub."""
735,"While this is funny, I don’t think it means that better gamers are necessarily less sexist on average. They probably just don’t feel threatened by the existence of female gamers because they’re already good. Someone who is insecure about his abilities is going to reach much harder for some other group of people to step on. The good players don’t have that same insecurity (though of course they may in other areas of their lives)."
736,"""Maybe if you spent less time caring about the gender of random people online, you'd actually be good"" is gonna be my new favorite."
737,"Honestly this lines up with one of my friends. He's average at best and thinks he's a god at video games, likes to belittle me and our other friends.

Then again this is the same guy who tried to convince me that lag doesn't matter and I should be 2 steps ahead of everyone else. But when he starts lagging THEN it matters."
738,"In the patriarchal social model, men are supposed to compete with other men. Among other things, they compete *for* access to women.

Note, this is bullshit, but it is a cultural subtext.

So what happens when women join the competition? How can *the prize* also be an agent in the competition? How can a man win the trophy when the trophy itself frags him at 100 yards?

For sexist men, it doesn't make any sense. There is no room in their social model to understand these things. Thus they feel alienated."
739,Can you link the study lol
740,"I'm not gonna lie, I always thought this was a known factor or something. Like, idk about anyone else, but a vast majority of the bigoted shit I've been on the receiving end of online usually comes out of *people that are losing or at least scoring lower than me* in most games. Or people that just don't realize that trying to pick up a date on a game where the other person has a fucking weapon pointed at them is generally a terrible idea all around when you're in a free for all deathmatch.

But on the other hand at least it's nice to have it confirmed in writing."
741,That makes me an anomaly; I suck at video games but I ain't sexist :)
742,"this isnt just for gaming, or sexism for that matter, the more competent a person the less likely they are to be discriminative, especially in their respective field, because theyre busy learning and improving and have a love for said thing and care about it, and people who contribute, degrading people is just a cheap way to try to make yourself superior without contributing fuck all"
743,it's that simple?? :o \*whispers\* noice :3
744,"Yeah, agree.

Usually when I see men being bigoted, it’s because they feel “oppressed” for something or other and need someone to blame so they don’t have to take any ownership for their own faults. Immigrants, minorities, women, non-binary... For these toxic gamers, losing to others at a video game is just a form of oppression.

It’s anecdotal, but in my experience, people who are confident and self-assured generally have no need to blame others for their own mistakes, and are therefore much less prone to bigotry. It tracks with the results of the study."
745,"Very true, and this probably doesn’t account for all of the well meant but demeaning advice some guys give when they’re good players looking down on others."
746,"Doesn’t sound like a very nice friend, haha..."
747,"Don't forget the good old ""this guy beat me at the game therefore they must be cheating or hacking""  and the ""they just got lucky"" logic. Because people with different skill levels above them totally do not exist."
748,That’s one example of being friends IN SPITE of something. Hopefully he Gits Gud
749,"I had to look it up because I’m not the original OP, but here you go: [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613)"
750,Someone has to be the exception lol
751,"Oh, and don’t leave out the “My controllers aren’t working, it’s not my fault!! Damn piece of crap!!”"
752,Thanks! Always like to document sources
753,Thank you!!
754,What can I say? I'm special ;)
755,The r/tipofmyjoystick subreddit may help you. They specialise in helping people remember games.
756,Is it like an old style beat em up? Like Double Dragon or Final Fight?
757,Streets of Rage?
758,"Do you remember what year you played it? Is it a side scroller, 2d or 3d?"
759,River city Ransom?
760,Silver from... 1990?
761,Mario...? 🤣
762,Super meat boy ?
763,"I'll post there too, thanks!

ETA: Got the answer over there, it's Street Fighting Man."
764,Yes.
765,"I checked, it isn't."
766,"2d and early 90s, though game is probably older."
767,"I checked, it isn't."
768,Gangsta mario
769,"> 2d and early 90s

Maybe [The Adventures of Bayou Billy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUZcbojyLBs)?"
770,damn maybe double dragon?
771,It isn't.
772,Ugh. Mechagon. I don't like being reminded I still have to grind rep there. 😝
773,Aww is she a fold or just an angry girl with her ears down?
774,Cute cat! What is this game called?
775,"This made me want to play WoW so badly, I haven’t played in years. That would kill any chance of actually doing any work from home though, but so hard to resist."
776,Aww shes so adorable with her droopy ears
777,Laptops are like kotatsus for cats.
778,I miss WoW 😭
779,Is that laptop floating in the air?
780,Cranky Kitty!
781,Alliance or horde?
782,She looks upset that you moved the warm laptop away from her lol.
783,That is such a cozy set up!
784,What laptop and mouse?
785,soooo sweet!
786,Cool laptop
787,I love the airplane ears lol. Cool laptop!
788,Scottish Fold?
789,Ngl she looks tired of ur shit. 😂 Adorable kitteh. <3
790,She requires snuggles well done providing
791,"my cat leaves me alone while I'm gaming for the most part... unless I'm raiding and then she's trying to climb on top of my laptop and needs to be glued to my face.. It's like they know.

I just got a Darkspear troll druid leveled up from 1-120 in less than a week. I'm loving the 100% rep boost this month."
792,I want a cat gimme 😻😋
793,I zoomed into your cat's face and stared for at least 5 minutes. I love her! So cute :))))
794,"I am usually a disc priest when playing with others ... but when soloing (depending on the quest) I alternate between disc and shadow. Lately with BG, I have been shadow."
795,"That’s so cute! My cat takes up 3/4 of the bed even though he’s tiny, he makes sure he’s in the exact centre. Also what is your experience with the gaming laptop? Is it any good? I would like to get one but I want to study on it as well."
796,"Hello fellow wow player!

How is the priest treating you? Mine is disc."
797,Cat: Not impressed with your setup ... also belongs in r/awww ...
798,i juuuuust got revered with rustbolt yesterday and got my flying and i could not get away from that island quick enough
799,"Hahaha, yeah, I finally decided to grind rep after a long while."
800,I haven’t been back since i got flying. Lol
801,Scottish Fold
802,Looks like World of Warcraft.
803,Defo World of Warcraft!
804,"Yes, World of Warcraft."
805,Well they have 100% rep bonus til April 20th ... 😉
806,"Yes, she is sooooo cute!"
807,only if by AIR you mean CAT ...
808,I miss Grumpy Cat. #RIP
809,lol she is more demanding than cranky.
810,Horde
811,She was upset that she couldnt curl under the laptop.
812,"Laptop: ASUS Strix
Mouse: Logitech bluetooth"
813,Yes.
814,Hahaha she prefers attention over other stuff I do.
815,"She usually is all over me when I am in battleground and getting ganked by multiple alliances. Yeah, our cats know. But wouldnt change it for anything."
816,"Hahaha, I am glad you like her. She is cute!"
817,I had to swap it with an SSD. It works really well for gaming and doing homework/studying. I use it for both.
818,Until you wanna get achievements and go everyday to kill steel freza but leave disappointed every day. I make the teleport things so it’s easy for me to get there
819,I thought Mechagon was gonna be cooler than some junk pile on a teeny island. I kinda hate the fact that they didn't take Operation Mechagon and make it a whole new zone because that would have been interesting but nah. I feel you I hated every moment of that grind.
820,She's precious :) raid on my friend
821,She isn't bothered by the weight or heat?
822,"AYYE, me too!"
823,[deleted]
824,Thank you so much ❤️
825,ugh nooooo i don’t wanna :( but will i bc i am a masochist that has to complete everything? yes
826,i haven’t even done operation mechagon yet so someone please reassure me it’s not that bad lol. but yeah for real i hate that island and everyone on it lmao
827,The weight isn’t on her ... if she had it her way she would be curled up under it.
828,Maybe ...
829,Sounds familiar !!!
830,"Operation Mechagon is a fun concept mega dungeon but it's split into two dungeons. That's really it. The Junkyard side of it is just the trash heap that you quest in but in a dungeon, it's boring as hell. The Workshop is the only interesting bit, but you spend such little time there. if would be cool if the Workshop was a zone you could explore because the concept is great."
831,Okay so what is the weight actually borne by? I can't see anything
832,"oh that does sound like a fun concept! but yeah, they’re getting worse and worse at implementing their fun/cool concepts lmao"
833,"Laptop is on top of towels, blanket, and cooling pad."
834,I wanna post my setup but I don't wanna scar anyone
835,Post it! This is a supportive community.
836,More Aloy memes 🥰
837,"Honestly,  stay away from chairs advertised for gaming.  You're going to want an office chair specifically with the back support you need. I'm sure mileage varies on them,  but I haven't found one that wasn't pandering plastic. 

If you can spring for a good office chair (look up reviews,  check your local charity shop), they can last years and years. When you check reviews,  check specifically for peeling and ""pilling"". If a lot of reviews say the chair pills or peels, think twice if it's worth the price."
838,"It's a problem everywhere, you'll just have to sit tight."
839,"Yeah there's a shortage in general because production is in China and China's not really producing anything right now.

I'm sorry about your situation though. A couple of days ago there was still the pink Switch Lite on Amazon but it looks like it's sold out now too. :/"
840,Check QVC or HSN. I bought a lite on qvc because I was too impatient to wait for other retailers to restock.
841,"If you have a PC you could always emulate one of the older Animal Crossing games to hold you over until you can get a Switch and AC:NH. I know it won't be the same but it's better than nothing.

Just keep checking every day to see when they'll be in stock, because I imagine they'll get bought up very fast once they are, as stock is limited for now. Demand is very high now because of the pandemic as well."
842,"You can use https://www.nowinstock.net to set alerts for when the online retailers get new stock, but you generally have to be fast else resellers scoop up the inventory to scalp.

Edit: You might also try GameStop's website for local stock.  They have a stock of Switch Lites in a couple of stores near me (Unfortunately I'm in Arkansas, so that's a bit of a trek from NC!)

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/switch/consoles/products/nintendo-switch-lite-turquoise/204520.html

Edit 2: Looks like Target is getting new stock of Switch Lites April 3rd!  https://www.target.com/p/nintendo-switch-lite-coral/-/A-79574296?lnk=nintendoswitchlite"
843,"I got a switch from target on saturday and there were lots in stock. Check early in the morning, I was awake at like 5am, and lots of stores had stock. I was able to buy one for in store pick up."
844,Yeah a friend wanted to buy one too but they're all gone until june at least. I wanted to get mine at the end of the month but I couldn't wait and got it three weeks ago. Got lucky on that one.
845,The coral pink lite is releasing this week ( I think) and every site I've seen still has it available for pre-order.
846,"I use my actual name for all games I play, it's never taken. Very clearly a female name. I've never had someone ignore me just because of my name in any competitive setting. He was probably just an easier target. But of course it could never be his fault!"
847,"I feel like if they know ur a girl it would be the other way around because , if their sexist, they would think the female players the weaker one and go after them. Honestly he was prolly just the crappier player lol."
848,"exactly! I always use my name for games or something close to it and never got ignored in a battle due to it being feminine. I usually had the opposite happen where they’d aim me cause i’m a girl, never the other way round. He got upset when I called out all his mistakes at the end of the match too!!"
849,"Psh, that'd require him to take responsibility! Why do that when you can pin it on someone else?"
850,"The Nintendo basics are always a good bet. Mario, Zelda, Animal Crossing, Pokemon. :)"
851,What are your interests? Maybe we can find a game that fits that and you can get more accustomed that way.
852,"Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a fun start for open world adventure. Lots to do and decent story.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons recently came out, and that's a really easy and accessible game to get into. It mainly involves building up your home, fishing, getting money, and establishing your own little island. It's laid-back fun. :)

For platformer / exploration with good aesthetics and atmosphere, I'd recommend getting Hollow Knight. You discover the story as you explore, and the combat is slick and responsive."
853,"Yonder: Cloud Catcher Chronicles is a good one to play to get used to 3D cameras without the stress of enemies! If you want something else relaxing, then the new Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley are great choices!

Super Mario Odyssey, Spyro Remastered, Super Lucky's Tale and A Hat in Time are all great 3D platformers for beginners.

For an introduction to RPGs, Pokémon is a good bet! Let's Go Eevee/Pikachu are very simple and have a lot of cute interactions with the Pokémon, and are based on the original Pokémon games with the first 151 Pokémon. Sword/Shield are the newest games in the series, also pretty easy games, and they have a lot more Pokémon and areas to explore.

Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is also a great introduction to open world action/adventure games! 

There's also the NES/SNES catalogues you get along with the online membership. They have a lot of fun classics."
854,"I bought my first ever console last year (a switch), and I can 100% say Mario Odyssey is the  best for beginner gamers :)"
855,"As with everyone else, I'm recommending Zelda Breath of the Wild. It was an amazing game and I can't wait for the second.


Pokemon Sword and Shield was also a lot of fun and if you've ever been curious to start its a decent game to start with. Although if you've played Pokemon Go and liked it, then you could start with one of the Pokemon Let's Go games. They fuse the main games with Pokemon Go mechanics nicely so it's a good entry point for people who started with Go. 


Octopath Traveler is a jrpg that I personally enjoyed. It runs on turn based combat (so no active combat) and random encounters with monsters. The slower pace of turn based combat might help you break into gaming a bit if active combat intimidates you. It also has a free demo so you can play a few hours to figure out if you like it without needing to commit money.


Stardew Valley is a relaxing farming game that let's you control a customized character and have fun getting to know (and even marry) the townspeople around you."
856,"Nice!  I really liked the first game in the reboot, though I had a former colleague once refer to it as a torture porn simulator due to all the gruesome ways you can die.  If you can look past that, it's really fun."
857,"It's such a fun game, have fun with it"
858,I have played it on ps3 and download it again for pc since it was free. A great game! I loved it so much!
859,[removed]
860,It’s such an awesome game! Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider are some of my favourite games. Have fun.
861,"This is a really dope game, they actually lost money because they made it so good."
862,This was one of the games that got me back into gaming! I loved it and replayed it to 100%. Hope you enjoy! 😊
863,Is it still free?
864,i hope you like it!!
865,I love it. Its like watching a freaking movie it's so smooth.
866,thanks
867,damn that's crazy I'm loving it so far
868,I am absolutely in love with this game.
869,unfortunately not
870,"My roommate has a cat that looks just like that. And their switch has the same joy-cons. This post actually tripped me up for a second.

Also s/he's a cutie!"

873,So cute!!
874,Lazarus ahhhh that is the cutest name for the cutest cat!
875,What a cutie!
876,"I actually bought the grey console on day one as there weren't any coloured ones left, then later bought extra coloured controllers for multiplayer. I didn't realise the colours were swapped from the console ones until I read your comment!"
877,"That’s so weird!! I bought a switch with the colored joycons, and the right one is red, left one is blue. I wonder why yours are like that.

Edit: If you buy individual joycons they come swapped. That makes sense!"
878,Is that Mr Robot art as your desktop background there?
879,What clock is this?
880,OSX on your main monitor and Mint on your secondary? Is one in a VM? I'm curious
881,"MacBook, iPad, pc and PlayStation... Are you a game developer or just exceptionally thorough?"

885,:O Hello friend...
886,Yes 🤓
887,I use my iPad. It’s fliqlo app
888,"Yup, you’re correct. Right now my MacBook is displaying. I use VMware for my developing environment, which is what is taking up the second screen. I believe I am using Mint."

891,Thanks!
892,Word! Thanks for the suggestion
893,I'm 3/4 the way through season 1 right now and loving it soooo much
894,I was just guessing. You're incredibly thorough! What sort of dev are you? #girldevsunite
895,"Nice! Hello fellow dev. I'm a front-end developer. Right now I work on a web app for a data storage company, so I work with javascript and Vue framework. We're about to release our new UI and I'm so stoked about it. I very much appreciated the UX process of it all. With that said, the whole process took about 2 years to do, so I'm also ready to move on to a different project lol.

How about yourself?"
896,"I too am a front-end developer. I'm a senior engineer at a fortune 500 bank, supporting their legacy online banking application. I spend every day wading through jQuery spaghetti and I'm extremely jealous of your opportunity to go deep with VueJS."
897,I feel you. Before we had Vue it was also just JS and jquery. Our old UI was definitely out of date. I want to dabble with react and angular at some point. Most importantly I want to get into mobile app design and development.
898,"""out of date"" really doesn't capture the hostility and incompetence encoded in our front end :)"
899,Enjoy! Hope your baby naps well to give you a chance
900,I’ve been on the fence about getting this game my bf just says I will love it but what is the goal? Is it worth getting?
901,"awww my bf also bought it for me as a gift, aren't we the luckiest? enjoy the game! :)"
902,Same! ❤️
903,"I had never played animal crossing before but I am loving it! It’s what you’d play when you’re in the mood for a game like The Sims or Minecraft. The goal is to build your island up, basically. It’s incredibly cute and wholesome and relaxing and peaceful, nice for when you need a break from fps and rpgs or intense storylines etc"
904,"Alriiiiight I downloaded it. I’ve been playing Nioh 2 and peaceful, cute, wholesome sounds like a great change of pace!"
905,"I asked my stepdad once why he plays female characters. His response was along the lines of, “If I have to look at it for untold hours, I want to enjoy it.”

Fair enough I guess"
906,Girls are fine if you're in control. A girl with agency? Nah. Might not want my dick!
907,"For shooting games and stuff, a guy friend says he goes with females bc their frame is smaller and less of a target. I found that intresting!"
908,Playing as girl characters really helped me figure out that I am a girl.
909,"My bf chose the girl character for Pokemon Sun (also he's not against any girls playing games, or anyone, he accepts everyone), and out of curiousity, I asked him why.

He told me, ""The girls have more customisation, and their fashion is better"" 😂 I was like, hell yeah we do"
910,"I can't speak to how other men behave or even why they have a problem with women playing games because I don't understand it either.

However I can explain my position as to why I as a man like to play as a woman in most games. It mostly comes down to the fact that I like seeing woman protagonists, and I don't see as many as I would like in other media. Plus I don't identify with most men in games (zero interest in macho manly stuff) and their customisation options are usually lacking."
911,Thank you.👌
912,[deleted]
913,it's also weird that whenever a game has a set female main character some gamers lose all temper and keep blaming companies for being woke but a lot of them seem to play as the female version in games that allow you to choose gender .
914,">  Isn't it ironic that some guys are so against girls playing games, yet they want to play....as girls?

Were the streamers talking about how they don't want girls playing games?"
915,"I almost always play as a girl if i have the choice.

If have to look at a character for long time, say like Diablo 3, i rather look at a girl then any dude available."
916,"One of my guy friends on Discord told me this as well. I was just like ""alright fair""."
917,Lol that's similar to my husband's reasoning. Girls tend to get better style options and look better so to him there are several games where he'd rather play as a girl.
918,That's the same as the female survivors in Dead By Daylight!
919,"This! now I can take this to my wife and show her there are other men out there that feel this way. 

I play a lahn in bdo and their costumes are so damn cool even thought it's a gender locked game I still find myself playing other female classes. 

Even in other games as well I dunno I just really like it"
920,">I can't speak to how other men behave or even why they have a problem with women playing games because I don't understand it either.

I actually had an interesting conversation where someone try to explain this to me a not to long ago. Basically, they said that many boys were picked on in school for liking video games instead of sports. Because of this, they were seen as outcasts, causing them to be the prime target for bullies. From this, they drew up the conclusion that a ""true gamer"" struggles for their place and that women have not struggled enough in the same way that they have struggled, so they cannot be deemed ""true gamers."" 

Long story short, many seem to enjoy gatekeeping and pass that attitude on instead of understanding the fact that the gaming sphere, and society, has changed a lot from when they were kids."
921,"I really enjoy the company, I haven't been in school for a long while so I dont get that everyone close together feeling. I guess I just like to talk and talking to everyone..."
922,"Oh girl, I had a guy follow me from the CrossRoads to that little village with the boat because I was a female Tauren.He specifically said I shouldn't being playing as a girl if I wasn't one in real life because that was deceptive. I was like, I'm a cow..."
923,"I could believe that being the case for some people. I can also understand the feelings of being picked on and thus not being kind to the people they perceive as bullies who are now trying to move into their turf, especially if they're children. 

But a lot of these men are adults and should know better. Also it doesn't explain other points of view where they believe that women are playing games to attract their attention and so are not real gamers. 

I know you're not saying that explanation applies to everyone, I think it says that the men who do have this point of view need to get some help."
924,Hey never heard of that viewpoint before and that is very interesting and there is some merit to it. Experiences may vary though I guess.
925,"What a weird ass dude, considering I think every female tauren I ever knew was a woman in real life"
926,">But a lot of these men are adults and should know better. Also it doesn't explain other points of view where they believe that women are playing games to attract their attention and so are not real gamers.

Oh yeah. There are a shit ton of reasons for why someone might do this (everyone if different.) Regardless though, it stems from toxic mentality and people should stop and think about it. Sucks that most of the people who think/act like this seem to also believe that self care, self improvement and talking to a therapist about their problems are a waste of time and for ""snowflakes."" If they only hang around others who have that same type of mentality they get more confidant in their toxicity towards those who call them out (pack mentality.) 

 It sucks that gaming companies also do not do much about players who clearly act this way either. If their behavior is way over the line, recorded and noticed, they seem to only get a slap on the wrist (like a 3 day ban) and continue because there are no serious repercussions against them, and they KNOW it. They revel in the fact that they can get away with it and get even more excited when they know that you know it too. Honestly, its sick."
927,"Yea that's true, pack mentality and trying to fit in I suppose also drives it. It doesn't have to make sense if it helps you fit in. 

You're right, a lot of games companies fuel it too with overly macho male directed power fantasies. For the people who do want to change this within the companies I'm sure there's a degree of concern over starting to punish behavior that they've allowed for so many years and the kind of backlash they might receive."
928,"I'm not positive if most games are on switch but here goes. Sorry if some of these dont hit you in the feels as I havent played most but heard good things.

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter

Gris

Lost Ember

Night in the Woods

Ori and the Blind Forest

Sea of Solitude"
929,"It has a completely different feel than what you're looking for, but no game has made me cry like Lisa the Painful. Shit's tragic.

If you haven't already played it, Telltale's The Walking Dead (esp. season one) is super emotionally provocative and has similar gameplay to other games you listed. 

I haven't played The Red Strings Club, but I've heard good things and I think you would like the aesthetic"
930,"I'd definitely recommend Oxenfree if you haven't already played it. VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action, The Red Strings Club and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy are some other games I've played on the Switch that are story centric with similar mechanics. 

I recommend checking out MechaNika and Agatha Knife as well, they're both relatively short adventure games. They're set in the same universe but don't have to be played in any particular order. I hope these recommendations help!

Also thank you for mentioning Life is Strange. The complete season is on sale on Steam right now and I just picked it up. So excited to play it!"
931,Check out Forgotton Anne
932,"Thank you, I’ll check those out !"
933,"Oh god the one with clementine rjght? I cried when you know when. 

Thank you I’ll check out the red strings club and Lisa the painful, I’m not sure why I’m in the mood for crying. I’m off to look at trailers thank you so much again!"
934,"Ah i hope you like it!!! 

Thank you so much for the recs, I’m going to look at all the trailers now lol."
935,"Thank you, I haven’t heard of this one."
936,Really? Then what about To the Moon?
937,"Yes really, and No i haven’t! I looked it up right now and it looks like something I would love. Thank you so much."
938,"Who knows. I’ve tried making All Girl teams in Overwatch, and I just get bombarded by male players claiming “reverse sexism” or saying I’m “assuming their gender” when I kick them.

I just play with randos, because I’ve lost hope I’ll be able to have a regular group of ladies to play with. ☹️

Edit: If any of y’all play Overwatch on PS4 and want to play with me, drop me a line.😁"
939,"Maybe when those same ""reverse sexism"" guys stop treating us like shit in every game we play, we won't feel the need to create a comfortable space for us to play without them.

Edit : Do I need to have Switch Online to play on the Switch?"
940,"It's very strange tbh because I've seen guys asking for friends to play with then stating at the end of their comment ""guys only please"" so it's funny that when girls only want to play with other girls they scream sexism but then turn around and go ""we dont want to play with girls"" ahhh men are funny"
941,"For people who are used to things being all about them, being excluded from a place feels like top-level oppression. 

For example, I saw a news article about an all-woman animation team, and the thread (made up of mostly men) wasn’t talking about how it was a good thing. It’s about how it was SEXIST and TERRIBLE and it’s the animation quality that should matter, not the animator’s gender. Those FUCKING FEMINAZI SJWs.

They failed to mention or realize that like, 75%-80% of animators in America are men. That’s changing, but as of right now, men dominate that field.

But no no. Women creating a studio to support other female artists, and give them visibility and a place they can work worry-free, THATS fucking sexist. 

It’s why there are all-women trains in Japan. Is that sexist towards men? No it’s fucking not. It’s because of sexism towards women that these spaces are needed. Women get harassed too often just for being women. That’s why they need a space where they can enjoy themselves freely, and that’s extremely hard to do with all the obnoxious victim-complex guys out there. 

In short: they’re fucking morons that are so used to getting their way, women creating spaces for themselves is “””””oppression.””””

[I think the concept is beautifully illustrated in this gif.](https://media1.giphy.com/media/2ohBHnGAWLY1G/giphy.gif?cid=4d1e4f29dd2c2b956b36ee4e73f96b6c54427695d0525610&rid=giphy.gif)"
942,"Anything that doesn’t include men is seen as oppression by them. They’re used to being included in everything and having options, so when they see a group they aren’t welcome in they rage about “sEe tHiS iS sExIsM ToWaRdS mEn”. 

It’s honestly silly and they should grow up."
943,Because cis het white males have never been excluded from things before so they all fully lose their shit that they may be treated like the rest of the world for once?
944,"The type of people who whine about that are the same type that want to abuse other players. They don't like it because they won't be able to harass you, and they use ""equality"" to try and shut it down. It's why hey accuse everyone else of ""virtue signaling"" because it's what they do, and can't imagine having empathy for other people. 

I don't believe any of them actually feel excluded, they just think they are doing the same thing women ""have done to them"" by forcing their way into private gaming groups, without ever realizing that they feel like ALL of the gaming industry is their private group and they feel threatened when they don't have total control over every aspect of *their* thing.    Or realizing that a private guild isn't the same thing as a business or public group. Or that equality and equity aren't always the same, but I figure if they whine about thins on online games they probably aren't the most intelligent or mature people to he discussing social philosophy with so mute them."
945,I'm not surprised after all guys made a big hubbub about when an Alamo Drafthouse had just 2 girls only showings of Wonder Woman. Just 2 showings not 2 days or something just 2 separate showings.
946,"Hi!! This sucks a lot and I’m so sorry ): I tend to stay away from online gaming for this exact reason :/ 
I just got a switch though and if this game is free I’m down to give it a try! :D"
947,"Hey I used to run a group for women gamers with my sisters (I am a man actually though just fyi) that was pretty large back in the day (~300 active people at one point but it is now disbanded after about 15 successful years since we all got old and busy). We started it after getting non-stop harassment when playing online games on the original Xbox live.

People have already explained why a lot of people react like this, but just a major tip that worked for us was that we didn't explicitly make our community for women, we just took all the things that women generally didn't like about playing with most men and put them in our rules.

So no bringing up someone's gender and making a big deal of it, no harassment or hitting on other members, general anti-toxicity rules (certain words and attitudes banned), etc.

The community naturally ended up being mostly women (probably great than 90%) because these are problems women had and cared about and it also kept us somewhat invisible to trolls by us not being overtly girl orientated. We also had a lot of really great men join who were just looking for a more chill community or looking for a group to play with their SOs or sisters and also several trans women or gay men who were looking to get away from the general toxicity of mainstream gaming. 

We occasionally had a troll or creep sneak in but it was pretty rare and they were usually able to be banned pretty fast due to our rules.

You shouldn't really have to do this, but whenever we labelled our group as being women orientated it just caused a ton of problems and attention so this approach ultimately worked really well for us. It kind of took the steam out of trolls really fast because if they felt discriminated against we would let them join but then they would just almost immediately get banned because they couldn't stick to our rules. If they did stick to our rules then they would end up becoming fine members of the community. So it was win-win."
948,"I can't tell you how many gaming groups I've been in where men were like ""Only one girl allowed max! or it's bad luck"" like we're old timey sailors on the sea. So dumb"
949,I'm part of discord community for women who play R6S and we shared a similar post to let women know we're out there and got the same kind of responses. I don't know.. just insecure men getting a dose of what women in the gaming community deal with all the time.
950,"I really wish I could join. Warframe has been getting a bit dull playing by myself but unfortunately I play on PC. I have a switch, but can't play Warframe on it because it uses a ton of space and I don't have a big enough SD card for it :c

Maybe one day once I can afford a big enough SD card I might try to join if you happen to still be playing then"
951,"I know it's not exactly what you're looking for but I'm one of the leaders of a small clan on switch and a lot of us are either queer, woman or both.  I'm in the both category ;) And we won't hesitate to kick someone out if they're sexist, homophobic or racist.  
And I'd love to have you join us :)  
or I'd love to run some missions with you and help you out, if you've already found a clan that fits what you're looking for :)"
952,"It's because these men are insecure. They don't know what it's like to be excluded from things because they've never thought to put themselves in women's shoes. They feel so defensive when women say ""sexism"" that they'll jump on the first opportunity to claim it for themselves without any understanding of the mechanism behind systematic oppression - neither do they care to understand. Lastly, they hide behind all these excuses because what they actually want is to have a lone female in their mostly-male group so they can freely harass her without having to worry that anyone will back up their victim. And that's the T, sugar."
953,Because White Male Fragility is a hell of a drug.
954,Because men believe they have a right to be everywhere.
955,"I've had similar experiences with Guilds in WoW. I joined a guild once that existed quite a few years ago that was supposed to be for girls only, just to realise it was probably about 50% men but 'they're the good ones!'. Listen men, I don't have anything against playing with you in general, but sometimes women just need an escape from you where they can talk about female things without worried some man is gonna get grossed out/butthurt or take it the wrong way and start wanking off to it.

Men get so offended when women want a space for themselves, but we have to sit down and shutup if we mention that they have exclusive gentleman clubs irl, 'man caves', and that the majority of sports teams are male exclusive already."
956,"Short answer?  Projection.  They're insecure fuckheads upset that their safe space is being disturbed, and lack the coping skills to do anything but shout REEEEEEEE at the top of their lungs.

Long answer?  Read on.

For the record, just in case it sounds sympathetic: Understanding something, or at least thinking I understand something, is not the same as condoning it.  It's a behavior that gives all of gaming a bad name, and I have no love for the people who live up to the stereotypes and caricatures that cause people to recoil at 'oh, you play games?' in ways they don't over TV, movies, and etc.

Anyway.

Gaming becoming socially acceptable has done wonderful things for the hobby, but gaming as a passion (and in some cases, gaming as a hobby, as opposed to gaming as an interest) is still a space with a ton of social outcasts.  Taking that to the logical extreme, the subset who are undesirable weirdos and treat women like shit online are undesirable weirdos in their offline social circles as well; losers racing to a space where they can think of themselves as winners, fronting about being the 'alphas' of what is, without pulling punches, their safe space.

When someone excludes them, in the space they retreat to to get away from a world that excludes them, they don't know how to react other than taking it as insult to injury, because how dare someone exclude *them* in *their* safe space!

Meanwhile, the rest of us are like 'WTF, mate?', because people who aren't ashamed (secretly or otherwise) of their hobbies want to share it with others, not keep them out of it..."
957,TLDR; https://twitter.com/dorrismccomics/status/1139551726376292354
958,"Misogyny, that's it."
959,I am a male and heard another male complaining about this one time. It was a decade ago and he was a full on 'nice guy' that didn't like women only groups because they excluded 'nice guys' like him. If he was excluded from those groups then all the women wouldn't be able to tell what a 'nice guy' he was and then how was he supposed to get a girlfriend? It was a five minute rant on Teamspeak when I was trying to find clans to join in World of Tanks. He was an officer in that clan so he wasn't about to leave to join another clan but it was the idea that he was barred from it if he wanted to that upset him.
960,Men don't like the idea that there may be a place in gaming that isnt *for them*. They perceive gaming as their territory and think it should be completely accessible to them so they get defensive and shitty when it turns out it isn't.
961,Because they're desperate for attention from girls.
962,People who don't get harassed struggle to understand being harassed.
963,"""Sexism towards men."" LOL

Some men / boys can't deal with not being allowed to have the world revolve around them. I've seen it in political activism too, with race as well as gender. 

It's to do with patriarchal entitlement and the assumption that all doors should be open to them because they're male."
964,"Fragile masculinity and men thinking we’re “destroying their safe space”, that’s why"
965,"Dickheads never stop to think that they might be dickheads.

That's why they're dickheads."
966,"I honestly don't know myself. Think it's because to them it's like children in a treehouse putting up a sign that's like ""Girl's Only"" and they get all prissy, but since they're ""adults"" they can't tattle to mommy and daddy. So they do the next best thing and try to take down whoever is building the club. These groups are formed as part of a safe space and honestly with the amount of harassment ive seen most girls go through, we need it. I don't give a shit if a club is Girls only, Guys only, LGBT only or what. If you feel the need to create your own safe space go for it. There are surely others who feel the same. Maybe it's just that one stupid mentality some have where, ""I can't get in so I HAVE to bash my way in."""
967,I just think they are worried about getting their butts kicked by a kick ass girl squad.
968,"Hey’a! I’m on switch too if you wanna play together sometime, IGN MizAmy!    
I’m already in a clan but it’s mostly for the research, and I don’t think I’ll have the patience to build one from scratch haha. It sounds super cool tho, but I don’t know anybody who plays so idk"
969,Because the only time you cant talk about gender is when your protecting yourself from people who treat you poorly because of your gender
970,"I stopped playing MMOs years ago because of shit like this. I played Elder scrolls online for a while though, never had any issue, everyone was great, but they may have thought I was just a dude with a female avatar.   


But honestly, sometimes it's great to just play with other women. Online I mainly run into guys because that's just how it is (wonder why, ha) and it's nice to make female friends. About 95 percent of the people I regularly talk to online are guys, and they're great, but having female friends is also great."
971,"> yet the comments under it bombarded her with claims of sexism towards men, attacked her for being insecure, and told her to better her social skills before asking for a safe space.

It almost makes you want to laugh, doesn't it? This exact response is why people look for all women / girl gaming groups. Yet the people leaving these responses often won't cotton onto the fact that it's their own behaviour that's the reason."
972,"They really don't seem to get that we often want all female spaces for a reason. ""reverse sexism"" is fucking bullshit, men are not being oppressed for not being allowed into one specific group for gaming"
973,I don't have that game but I'm always down for clans
974,Hey if guys wanted an all guy group I wouldn’t care. People are allowed to keep to their own to relate to specific things or feel more comfortable. I can’t fault anyone. Only part were it gets iffy for me is race and religion.
975,I'd love an all girl group for gaming but I just play with my husbands friends. They know boundaries with me and it's always friendly.
976,Ahhh Warframe! We should play when I get my laptop fixed :) it’s honestly so much fun and addicting
977,"I've tried this a few times over the 20+ years I've been gaming online and the sheer amount of B\* I've had thrown at me from guys raging because I just want to game without all the OMG UR A GIRLZ crap.  
Now I'm an old lass I've found the older gaming communities like TheOlderGamers and such a haven for being able to find friendly people to play with - for the most part, a lovely bunch of people.  
It's a good alternative."
978,Dudes are so used to getting everything they want and having all discussion involve them that they will flip out if anything changes that. That and Reddit is hardly a progressive place.
979,"Because any sane man would choose to be in a group with another man, instead of a woman. 

They don't understand that women, for plenty of other reasons that don't have anything to do with men, would like be in a group with their own gender. 

They assume we're excluding them. We are, but not as main action. Our main action is to seek kindred (gender). 

When you are the default and individuality is punished, what do you do? Be & keep the default.

This is very generalised and my opinion on this. I hope it's understandable, this is not my main language."

I think every community is defined by the nature of it's members , it describes everything in this world.

It's in that OP's case a masculine place filled with narrow-minded guys , add some anonymity and you don't know who is that typing freely from his phone/PC screen , of course she would be targeted like you described , because people like to attack what's different to them.

I do understand *why* it becomes a necessity at times, but it's rough nonetheless. Tons (okay, maybe not tons, but there's like, dozens of us!) of guys aren't toxic, and we hate playing with the toxic people just as much!

Generally speaking, I think the 'ban the behaviour, not the people' is a really solid way of going about it.

It's weird though, and it might just be because of the games I play, I've never seen a 'no-girls' rule for groups, but it's seemingly a common thing? Is this a competitive shooter-game kind of thing, or..?

This is what's negative and toxic, not the comments here.

An extreme example would be that we can't 'agree to disagree' with white supremacists because their very ideology is intolerant.  

""Sexism against men"" isn't a thing. Anyone arguing that it is is making a ridiculous argument in bad faith to try to interfere in someone else's attempts to create a safe space, and we shouldn't treat it as anything but that."
1041,"> Commenters are even bringing color into this. I am hispanic and can tell you from what I have experienced in my family, hate isn't exclusive to white males.

1042,"Protecting yourself from people who usually make your gaming experience miserable isn't prejudice, it's common sense, and it's taking control of a situation so that you can have fun more regularly. We all know it's 'not all men' and not every man is going to be a dick, but by just gaming with girls you eliminate the possibility of it being a problem. Forcing yourself to play with men so you don't seem sexist when they normally give you a bad time just seems like... being stupid."
1043,"In a perfect world, maybe one day this will be true. But right now there's still a lot of prejudice and harassment out there so there's often a real need for minorities to seek out their own groups.

If you are a white westerner moving to Asia you are probably going to want to seek out other white westerner groups for shared experiences and culture. If you are a man trying to enter a female dominated sport or activity, you probably are going to want to seek out other men for support as a minority. In these examples it doesn't mean the person is prejudice, they are just looking for support from their minority group to overcome challenges the majority probably isn't even aware of or unlikely to understand. The same goes for women in gaming.

Women are minorities in most video games and it's pretty reasonable they would want their own groups to generally avoid harassment and share more cultural similarities. This of course doesn't mean that other woman are always going to be great or men are always going to be bad, it's just probably a lot more likely you'll face less harassment and more understand with people from similar backgrounds.

I am a man but grew up with three sisters and was largely in all woman gaming groups. We started an online community that was generally for women just because there was incessant harassment from randos but we frequently let men in who were cool and often kicked women out who were not cool. There was no assumption of men being bad or prejudice here, it was just a (successful) attempt to find people who might likely have a similar attitude while gaming.

I hope one day this changes but honestly we still can't play with randos to this day without people making a big deal of us having women or someone in our group getting hit on or harassed. There's still an obvious need for it."

1051,"Same here. I acknowledge I don't have great mechanical skills. In fact, I downright suck with some heroes. But I don't let that stop me from playing the game. Recently, I had a game where I did not do well and did not get many kills (not for lack of trying, and I tried to make up for it by being strategic and communicating with my team). When we lost, one team member after some earlier testy sassy comments aimed at me immediately jumped on chat asking if I had gold elims/dmg, clearly ready to throw down verbally. But I just straight up said, ""No sorry, I tried but I'm pretty bad."" I think that threw them for a loop because they suddenly did a complete 180 and then THEY told ME, ""Nah you were fine you were communicating with the team a lot."" And suddenly everyone jumped in chat saying we all tried our best and it was fine. Then the original person invited me to their group! I couldn't help but laugh at the ridiculous scenario."

I mean it's the same reason there's not a ""white history month"" in America it's already the default there's no reason to explicitly ask for it. However, there are legitimate white history month's in countries where white people aren't a majority. It's all about context.

If you want an all guy gaming group, you don't even need to really form a group just queuing up with randos you'll be getting mostly men in most communities. Then there's a lot of clans that don't explicitly need to list it but when a girl joins they tell them to leave or make them feel unwelcome.

It's just a majority thing though. If you join a gaming community that's mostly women (which is common for a few games) you'll see some people asking for a guys only group.

> I'd feel weird, maybe a little bit offended even

You really shouldn't feel offended. In any community with some cultural minority there's a desire to seek out other minorities. Majorities have the stage most of the time it's really not a huge deal to give minority groups a small space that can be theirs. Being offended is just exacerbating the problem because a community is making an effort to feel more welcome and now you are mounting an attack to make them feel even less welcome.

I suggested approaching it non-gendered just because it's easier, but honestly it really should not be a big deal if someone wants to make a women's only group in a community with minority women.

We are all are a minority in some context, so it really shouldn't be that hard to sympathize with."

It's also really fun to hack and slash your way through all the enemies. I'd say look at a few videos/reviews and if it seems like something you'd enjoy then at least give it a try."

1072,"I highly recommend it, if you like looter-shooters. I dumped over 1000 hours on it - yes, one thousand, it's not as uncommon as you might expect - and still play on occasion. If you decide to try it, here is some advice:

- be willing to look stuff up and ask questions (player base is super friendly). The game has been around a long time and has systems on top of systems, relics of defunct systems, and brand new stuff still being worked on. So just take it easy and don't expect to be able to learn everything right away, there is just too much.

- your first objective, for the first 80-100 hours, is to unlock every node in the star chart. If you log in and are unsure what to do, go unlock nodes.

- don't farm, you might be tempted to farm for a specific weapon/frame/item. Don't. Just play the game (progress through the star chart) and do whatever side activity you might, from time to time, feel like doing.  After a while you will open your inventory and find you have a bunch of stuff you can craft. Don't loose your sanity by farming early on.

- don't spend your starting platinum on anything other then Warframe/weapon slots. Nothing else, period.

Good luck."

If my guess is right, it's less to do with setting up a Little Rascals-style ""He-man womun-haters club"" and more to do with the slight of being told ""we don't want you around"" in the place they go to get away from the rest of the world telling them ""we don't want you around""...bringing the reality they're trying to hide from crashing down, violating the sanctity of their sanctuary.  

The sad irony is that they don't realize what they're doing is getting upset they aren't welcome to violate the sanctity of someone else's sanctuary.

Which now that I bring them up, it makes me wonder if half the mess we're in now dates all the way back to people who 'learned' what childhood 'is supposed to be like' \[complete with 'cooties'\] from stuff like Little Rascals, Leave it to Beaver, and Dennis the Menace."

If we emphasized to children that gender isn't something over which to divide but rather just another trait, we would probably have way better adjusted adults.

That was kind of my point - no woman is saying 'all men aren't worth dealing with' by doing this. They're choosing not to expose themselves to the bad apples and unfortunately there's no other way to do that. You can't vet your teammates to see if they're bad people beforehand. Just making sure you don't encounter the bad ones doesn't mean you're saying all men are bad. That really would be prejudiced.
1102,"Again, ideal world I would agree. But we aren't in an ideal world and it's sometimes safer and easier to just play with women and worry less about harassment or creeping.  Not everyone wants to go through the hassle of enforcing strict rules and vetting everyone they let into the clan, they just wanna play with other women because it's an easy way to feel comfortable and that's fine.

To go back to my analogy you could call someone racist for being a westner in Asian and wanting to start a support group of other westners in the area. You could argue that locals can also be understanding to your struggles and be able to help you, but it's not about that obviously they can. It's just that it's far more likely people from the same culture as you and similar to you are going to understand your struggles more and it's just easier. There's no racist malice behind it and it doesn't mean you're not mingling with locals, it just means you have one specific support group you can go to when you need to. I don't understand why people try so hard to take that away."
1103,"As you said, it's *based on experience*, so no it's not.

It's someone's personal group in a video game. I don't even know why this is an issue."
1104,"I’m completely with you, games are meant to be fun! And the environment should be fun and stress free....but there are so many garbage humans populating the online world."
1105,"There's an entire subreddit devoted to that r/onejoke . It's both painful and satisfying to read. I think I just like it because it affirms that there are a lot of other people unwilling to tolerate shitty transphobic ""jokes."""
1106,"It actually hurts they repurposed that as a joke. I'm trans and I wouldn't call my voice passing, so... that being turned into a ridiculous punchline-in-itself - to not assume who I am based on my voice - is not great."
1107,"Of course, common sense to not make these jokes if a trans person is around. But among friends? Cmon... Those zir/zer third wave feminists will never stop being funny."
1108,Dumb little children only know how to go for the low hanging fruit. What else is new... 😂
1109,"It’s a really common thing in meme subreddits. I never understood it. 

I THINK it’s because they associate emojis with instagram users and Reddit hates Instagram. They think any girl/woman with an IG is just a “thot” and boys/men that use it are “simps”/“white knights”.
 
I could be wrong, but I’m pretty sure that’s why."
1110,Are you also one of those people who belive racism against white people doesn’t exist?
1111,"Of course you can't know beforehand, but you can kick anyone from your clan who misbehaves."
1112,"I mean I honestly kinda don't believe in it anymore, that the onliny gaming community gets better cause as unfortunate as it is, like you said: A good amount of people in it do have some very garbo personalities all around... :I So it's kinda like playing lottery sometimes u do encounter some super nice people, that you can actually get comfy with, but a lot of the other times it's just: Meh, another one of these (Also I cannot really deal with people who rage at videogames, with rage I literally mean: Screaming and insulting the enemy team and stuff, it's so super weird to me :I Like it also kinda defeats the ""fun"" purpose for me :D)"
1113,"I mean I feel like there is probably a Subreddit for everything out there, at this point! :D

Yeah Transphobia is still pretty big, but at least I feel like there are more people starting to ""wake up"" now and realize that most of the ""arguments"" are literally just reused homophobic arguments and before that ones which were used against black/people of colour in general.

(Prolly not gonna look much into that subreddit myself, cause I'm likely just gonna go insane at one point with the ""joke"" Q\_Q)"
1114,"Same, much same ^^
A reason I do not use VC in Multiplayer Games."
1115,"That's why I love the various souls-style multiplayer things. No voice chat, just gestures. It's nice."
1116,So edgy. So brave.
1117,🤦
1118,Racism against white people *doesn't* exist.
1119,Yes.
1120,"Or you can cultivate a space that feels safer because you're preventing it from ever having to deal with that misbehaviour in the first place. It's obviously not ideal, but I think it would only be 'prejudiced' if the women making those clans believed all men were going to misbehave if they were let in. That's kind of what prejudice means. Forming your opinion of someone based on an unfair preconception. Nobody is saying that all men would be shitty. I don't think we're going to agree on this so I'm going to stop here, but I hope you can understand where I'm coming from that I think your use of the word 'prejudice' doesn't fit if the clans don't actually think all men are like that."
1121,"Yeah. I mostly play online with people I know IRL, but I’d love to have more PSN friends and all that. But like you said, it is truly is a gamble and honestly, it’s tiring to try playing with new people and have them be terrible match after match. 

In my case, with Overwatch, the matches go better when you can you can talk with your teammates. But when you have people on mic who are toxic or people who aren’t playing to have fun, it sucks any possible enjoyment out of it. Not to mention the saltiest people are usually not very good at the game either. 🙃"
1122,"Yeah admittedly reading that sub can be infuriating in all the ways you'd imagine lol.

I too am glad that society is (slowly) moving in a more accepting direction. It breaks my heart how hateful and hurtful people can be, and it's always nice to see that there are good people out there too."
1123,"Yeah thank you for putting it into words, my brain didn't want to do anything but that Emoji as a response. :I

I mean how does this person know, that no one of their friends is trans (or part of any other marginalized group if we spreaden the context), like I wouldn't be surprised if somebody was trans, but would choose not to come out to them, cause that behaviour is just: yikes."
1124,"Jesus christ, where do you get ideas like this? Racism can be directed at literally anyone. It may not be as prevalent, or systematic toward white people but that doesn't mean it does not exist. I get that you see yourself as progressive, but this ain't it. Putting down white people or men does not fix the past nor the present."
1125,"I'm not saying all women who make women-only groups believe all men are bad, but avoiding men entirely does project mistrust and fear, which is why men resent it, which is what OP was wondering about. No one appreciates being treated like they're the worst of people, regardless of whether there's basis for it. It just doesn't treat people like individuals."
1126,"Funnily enough I kinda just gave up PSN at some point as well xD Which is why my current PS 4 has probably not been used for like half a year or more at this point (aside from if I randomly want to play something like Nier;Automata, Final Fantasy XV or Persona5)

I mean most teambased games are usually better with communication, but yeah a lot of the times that ""communication"" is really not ""wholesome"" :I

Meeeeeh, can't people just be nice to each other, it's so much better to spread love than toxicity/hate!"
1127,"Yeah I sometimes do have that feeling that maybe I'm too ""soft"" to exist? Cause I seriously just can't/don't wanna comprehend, why people CHOOSE to be this hateful and bigoted towards others. Like it is so much better/easier to just spread love, instead of hate and it feels a lot better! :P

But honestly when I thought about it, I sometimes feel there might be a sort of envy in place for these type of people: They see Queer people lightning/glowing up after coming to terms with themselves and kinda ""achieving"" a sort of happyness, that certain cishets are missing out of. And if they are left out of the spotlight, it leads to them throwing those kinda ""temper tauntrums""

As a ""funny"" sidenote: There is this one big transphobe ""feminist"" on Twitter, that literally is on a vendetta solely against Trans Women, cause one of them criticized his comedy show at one point... It's incredibly sad to see... :I"
1128,"We don't get 'ideas' like this, we get facts. Who experiences racism isn't just a theoretical discussion. The world is full of statistical evidence of disparities that can be quantified. Racism isn't as simple as someone saying, ""Man, I hate all black people!"" It's **so many people** valuing white people over black people that the average black family earns about half as much as the average white family, or that the unemployment rate for blacks is twice that for whites, or that the wealth of the average white family is ten times the wealth of the average black family.

White people are never going to live this."
1129,"Some men resent it because they are pissed off that there's a space closed off to them. It has nothing to do with calling all men bad. It's a sense of entitlement that some men have to all spaces. The men that aren't bad, the one's that aren't the worst people, and the ones that we don't need to avoid are, ironically, the ones that won't have an issue with women's spaces. If a man is getting angry that a space is closed off to him because women don't want to deal with male toxicity, he's exactly the reason that space exists in the first place."
1130,">I sometimes feel there might be a sort of envy in place for these type of people: They see Queer people lightning/glowing up after coming to terms with themselves and kinda ""achieving"" a sort of happyness, that certain cishets are missing out of.

I had one dude admit it outright, on a particular sadnerd forum I used to read. He said he was ""grey"" and resented ""the colorful people.""

It was such an alien mentality that I wasn't sure how to respond."
1131,"What you are talking about is called systematic racism. Your mistake is applying terms used in an sociological academic setting talking about systemic issues to every day use of words. You are correct in all your facts but that doesn't mean that you can't act in a racist way toward white people. It might hold less weight, but racism is still racism, which is by definition ""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior""."
1132,"Yeah I do sincerely believe that I'm not actually wrong with my take. \^\^

At least it would kinda make sense? Because for what else reason are people gonna be mad if other people are finding happiness, like quite literally there should be absolutely no reason, but absolute envy. As unfortunate as that is... That is why I feel like a lot of TERFs are usually 30-50 year old ""housewomen"" married to your stereotypical beerdrinking (maybe somewhat abusive man)  dude and thus being completely unhappy. It is uncanny how often I see these type of TERFs (aside from some of the edgy teen ones and the ones that pretend to be women lmao). And because of that they randomly throw out those fits/temper tauntrums to let some steam off. 

The world is super duper weird sometimes."
1133,Your mistake is thinking I take you as any kind of authority on my understanding of language and context. Your dusty '70's era definition is antiquated and your insistence that racism against white people is a thing is tedious and regressive.
1134,Same lol..
1135,Pocket Camp club unite.
1136,I play both- no shame at all. And that crown is awwwwwesome
1137,"I've sunk hundreds of hours into Don't Starve. Technically there is farming in the game, but it doesn't involve watering or maintenance and could be avoidable if you have enough to sustain you from other food sources. In it, you are (literally) dropped into a sandbox world to fend off madness, starvation, and various mobs. The island DLC is great, too, and there's a multiplayer option if ""you v. wilderness"" is too lonesome during quarantine."
1138,"Dragon Quest Builders 2 is pretty good! It's part building sim, part RPG. It has cute graphics and you can tame monsters and things. Has a couple farming elements but it's definitely not the focus like in Stardew.

There's also My Time at Portia, which is very similar to Stardew, but focuses on crafting more than farming. If you enjoyed the social elements in Stardew you'll probably like this too!

You could also try emulating the older Animal Crossing games if you want to see what all the hype is about. They're very relaxing games to play."
1139,"Littlewood!  It's a lot like stardew and animal crossing; you manage your town, gather crops and resources, and interact with the townsfolk.  It's super calming and relaxing, and very cute.  I only just started playing and I'm so happy with it.  And it's made by an indie developer who's very active in the community!  It's Steam Early Access but gets updates regularly"
1140,Minecraft? You could do survival or go into creative mode and just build your dream world! You could do both by allowing cheats or use peaceful
1141,"I can 100% recommend the following for relaxation and escape (other than Minecraft, Terraria, and Stardew Valley which I also approve of): 

Planet Zoo (and I've heard that Planet Coaster is fun too) and House Flipper (and Garden Flipper) Both are creative and resource management based, especially Planet Zoo. With PZ you can build and run your own zoo. With House Flipper you buy and renovate a house (it's a dream for HGTV fans)

Slime Rancher is a super fun and colorful and charming shooter/farming game. Very enjoyable, and it has a unique art style and imaginative sci-fi sort of vibe.

Cities Skylines is an excellent city builder/resource management sim game. It can get a bit stressful though if you take it as seriously as I do.

The Sims 4 is so much fun and you can get lost in it for hours and hours just living out the lives of your sims.

And for platformers, Ori and The Blind Forest (and its sequel, Ori and The Will of the Wisps) is my favorite platform game of all time. It's gorgeous and immersive and the story is so good and the music is incredible.

I hope you find what you're looking for!"
1142,"Dragon quest builders looks really good, that one is next on my list, but will probably wait for a sale"
1143,Thanks! Downloaded it and it seems great so far
1144,"I gotta agree with Slime Rancher right here, fun and cute af game that can get pretty hectic at times."
1145,Buy the GOTY Edition. The DLCs are *excellent*.
1146,"Idk if you'll like the game, but yes the goty version is worth it."
1147,"Hearts of Stone has, in my opinion, the best storyline in the game! Hope you enjoy them"
1148,"I started playing it on my brother's xbox while he had a game pass subscription, so I know I like it. I just don't know anything about the dlcs included in the GOTYE. Do they add something good to the story?"
1149,"The 2 story dlcs basically add new standalone storylines that both have a small effect on the main game storyline but are also affected by the base game at the same time depending on the order you play them in. It's sorta hard for me to explain without too many spoilers, but the main changes are mostly dialogue choices in the main game that flesh out the events of everything going on in the dlc stories, or small events that follow up on some of your choices that didn't get any closure in the main game.

So it's worth getting if you know you like the game, but it's also worth mentioning that the story dlcs are a bit of a step up in difficulty compared to the base game. Not a deal breaker, but something to be aware of is all."
1150,"The main story? No. B&W is around 2 years after the main story, HoS can be done during but it's best to do them after you're done with the main story.

Edit: I mean they do add great content to the game, just not important parts to the main story lol"
1151,"all right, thank you! I am a total noob, and I've been playing the game in easy mode, so that warning is totally appreciated lol

I'll think it over the next couple of days, thankfully I have a bit of time."
1152,"Thank you! New storylines are exciting, that's definitely a plus"
1153,Why not use discord? Me and my friends do this all the time!
1154,I'm so confused 🤨 is someone else playing your game remotely?
1155,We use discord. Because I’m usually in pajamas or whatever.
1156,I wish I could play online. It looks like fun.
1157,"NGL my first thoughts were, ""Shit that's so fucking cute."""
1158,"Yesss, that’s fantastic. I have a clan I play weekly with on Destiny 2, but because of the quarantine we’ve been playing almost on a daily basis. It has been a huge factor in keeping sane. All of us online gamers were built for surviving these crazy times."
1159,Can I join the group? xD (but in all seriousness...)
1160,"I was thinking about this the other day. They should have it to where we can webcam to people in our party while playing a game. But then it makes me think, is that what they were trying to accomplish with the kinect? Idk, but either way, looks very cool and connected!"
1161,Same situation here
1162,"I play siege too!!
Add me plzzz would love to have someone I can play with"
1163,"Spent yesterday playing Empty Epsilon bridge simulator with a dozen friends over discord, it was amazingly fun."
1164,"No, I was dead and in spectate mode when I filmed this.
Watched the rest of the squad clutch the round :p"
1165,"You can do it in discord. Also, I don't know why you would, your internet would get worse because you'll be streaming"
1166,Ohh hahah looks like fun!
1167,That's true. Dont need lag while trying to shoot
1168,EXACTLY i'm sure they aren't all hardlined.
1169,"Drawful 2 is free right now. And a handful of other games on Steam and the Epic Store. I always add them to my queue just on the off chance that one day I'll play them. (Though we all know I probably won't, because who has time for that?)"
1170,World war Z is free on epic store right now. Pretty fun game.
1171,"If you don't mind buying games, only 1 person needs Jackbox and you can screen share on Skype or something."
1172,Deceit is a free murder mystery game on steam. Might not be what you're looking for but it can be fun
1173,"> browser based games. 

Maybe try Skribbl - a drawing guess game."
1174,"If you’re interested in playing Settlers online, I would try colonist.io over Catan Universe. It’s still a little buggy but significantly better."
1175,"Second this. Though when we had my friend buy this game earlier, Epic store asked him to input his payment details (though nothing was charged)."
1176,"I don't understand toxic players either. Stopped playing league some years ago because it was just not enjoyable for me anymore. Don't regret it one bit, I feel way more relaxed now.

I'm not saying you should stop playing too, do whatever feels right for you. I can recommend taking a step back and evaluating if a game is causing you more frustration than joy."
1177,"I've been playing solo queue almost exclusively since Season 2 and quitted last year. This is pretty much standard LoL behaviour, one of the most toxic communities in existence."
1178,"I mean... it's League

I just kinda gave up at some point to look for "" a logical "" reasoning as to why players throw temper tauntrums like all the time and so quickyl :I"
1179,"I very rarely play with randos (for that exact reason) I usually play full team of friends (vs either real players or bots), majority of friends vs bots or custom games with only friends. And then I play a lot of tft also (everyone is usually quiet. I’ve only run into 1 or 2 toxic players during all my games). I mostly play it because it’s the only multiplayer game my boyfriend is really into. I never play when I’m not with him or our friends."
1180,"That’s why I only play with friends. We (usually) have fun. Although there’s some drama because 1 person is being “toxic” (he always try hards, we mostly play for fun. He also targets me or leaves lane to come kill me. I’m new to the game so I’m a very easy target and the general consensus is to go a bit easy on me so I have time to learn the game and I’m not just dead all the time). There’s also some stuff about him abusing admin powers on our discord towards a specific girl (he is just mean to her for some reason and the other admin is her ex so she has it rough lol)"
1181,"Yeah, playing with a group of friends definitely sounds like fun. My experience is mostly based on solo q ranked games, and oh boy was that toxic."
1182,"No gyms anymore, only just dance. Trying to keep ourselves occupied while the world is ending around us."
1183,I’m so happy my partner bought a treadmill for our apartment right before the quarantine.  I’d kill for a good ddr pad right now tho
1184,I have the demo version and it's ok for a warmup session. I'm not sure if it's worth it to pay the full price if I play alone...
1185,How long have you been playing Just Dance? I had it for a week but gave up. I think it's a bit boring to play alone. :(
1186,"I got it for 20 during black friday, I think."
1187,"Out of the three people playing, I actually care about the game the least. I think what makes Just Dance fun for me is to play it with friends, and also just getting unlimited (begrudgingly) to get all of the actual good songs. My friend is a huge fan of ABBA, so there are a lot of songs of theirs on here.
But I definitely understand if you are alone, it might be kind of boring. I guess just pick songs that you want to dance to, and just dance away?"
1188,"I did that. I wanted Just Dance to be my daily workout, but I feel a bit bored, I can't get myself to put some energy into my movements. But thank you for this post, it reminded me that I should get myself moving again because the lockdown makes me stay in bed all day."
1189,"I get that. I guess if I did not have roommates, I would definitely melt into my bed and morphed with it or something. I hope you find it fun to dance again then."
1190,On YouTube there’s a channel that I dance to sometimes called TheFitnessMarshal. I’m not sure if you’ve heard of it but he’s very energetic. I’ve been doing a combo of just dance and his channel to stay a bit active.
1191,This bring me joy!! I had an Apex win today too after making dinner. If only I was also wearing an apron!
1192,"I know the double life feeling. Most women I know look at me as if I have two heads when/if they find out I game. It makes it harder to connect with them most times so I try not to bring it up. Which makes me sad, because I want to share my favorite hobby."
1193,"Man I have more hours than i like to admit in apex, and I steal squeal like a child when I get that good game, once I killed three people and forgot to take my bread out of the oven lmao"
1194,A fellow apex player! Who do you main?
1195,I love the mental image of you playing in your apron and bandana and tbh that's exactly what I do lol
1196,Yass! I knit & crochet & sew & bake & pubgmobile... Might have to try apex again. It is kinda lonely when none of my irl friends play with me. But the introvert in me says it's all good.
1197,"There are sales on a regular basis. And there is also a way to upgrade it to GamePass which will give you access to so many great games on Xbox. If I recall I have signed up for just LIVE. And did a promo for GamePassUltimate for $3 and it upgraded my whole year for $3. 

Look for the deal, it’s worth it for the price of one game."
1198,"While I can only speak for myself, I think it's most likely because people can be terribly toxic online -- especially to women. There are a lot of tagged ""Venting"" posts that users here had made about jerks saying terrible things to them just because they are women. 

That is why I personally wouldn't talk to a group of strangers while playing games. It has the potential to be stressful."
1199,"If my husband would be on same chat as me I would probably get encouraged to enter voice chat. However we dont play online games together.

In the past I was: 

- treated as a toy who couldnt have my own word, 

- a bait for other men to join voice chat

- target for men who wanted gf. Some were really hard to deal with and they significantly destroyed my fun from playing by stalking me etc.

- apparently someone who could listen bad, not funny and insulting ""jokes"" or sexist jokes. When I say its insulting and get angry im immediately called drama queen or ""she is on period"". They dont treat me seriously.

On chat its easier to keep distance, block someone or avoid ppl. I dont have mic anymore and im happy with it. Still bad things happen (like above), but its bit easier to deal with them and they happen less times. 

I dont feel comfortable talking with ppl on voice chat anymore, especially with men. Probably because reasons listed above. I prefer talking in real (which will never happen with ppl from games) because they are more humans or via text chat."
1200,"I have no interest in talking to random ass folks, whatever their gender. With people I know, it is a different story, and I have no trouble shooting shit for hours lol. Among friends, all women I know are exactly as chatty as I am, but if there is even one person we do not know, we are a lot more quiet (and we have actually talked about this, too)"
1201,Because I get sexually harassed when I speak lol. I have a very feminine voice so you can tell I’m a girl immediately and fuck man some dudes are gross. So I usually will keep to myself
1202,"I don't know if you are aware but this comes off as a little ""I'm not like other girls""

When people who tell you they are shy maybe it's because they are shy, maybe they don't want to chat while gaming, maybe they feel uncomfortable with how chatty you are?

It seems to me that if everyone you encounter doesn't want to engage with you in long conversations it could be time for you to consider how you are coming across

Personally I don't game to converse.  I don't play online to avoid being harassed and I find general conversation when I am concentrating on my game a bit annoying, with the exception of gaming with my husband co-op"
1203,"For me it's mainly social anxiety. I really struggle talking to people I barely know. I'm better at talking to people I'm with in person because I can see them and read their body language. But with voice chat I can't do that. Hell, I even struggle a lot when making phone calls for important things.

Funnily enough though I don't struggle too much when talking to people online through text. It's just voice. I don't know exactly why voice chat makes me anxious in comparison. But it does. So I can seem quite outgoing to people online until they ask to voice chat. 😅 I don't play online games much anyways so communicating while playing games isn't necessary for me.

For others, I imagine they've had bad experiences talking to people through voice chat in games, judging by the amount of vent posts. I've even seen vent posts from women that have had other women be horrible to them for no reason on voice chat. So it's understandable most women are wary. I imagine they want to try to make friends but they can't help staying in their shell until they get to know people better without any pressure. It can sometimes take a while depending on the person. It may take even longer if there's several people in the group that they don't know.

I guess my advice is just be patient with any quiet girls you meet in games and let them open up on their own terms. If they don't, they don't. If they do, you might make a good friend in the end! But patience and understanding is key. :)"
1204,"When people realise in a game that I'm a girl (now woman), they start to talk down to me. Not flirting, just start to harass. ""Make me a sandwich"" is just the beginning, it is usually hate or aggression what I face. It happened even then, when I joined the TeamSpeak group of my brothers best friends (so people, who knew me for years), where I just wanted to be ""part of the guys"", I always made feel outside. 

Years ago I started to behave wholesome in the game chats, where it is usually the opposite (like in LoL), but I lost a lot of energy during that time. So I gave up, and just chat short or don't talk at all. I also avoid online games, and just focus on singleplayer nowdays. It is sad, as I used to be friendly and open for everyone in games."
1205,"It kinda changes. Me and the only other active girl on our discord can be both. If we’re concentrating hard, don’t have anything particular to contribute (like when most of them are in a game and we’re doing something else) or if we just don’t feel like talking we’ll be more quiet. If we’re in a good/talkative mood we might talk all the time. Last night we were bitching about toxic players through the entire games. Yesterday she almost didn’t say anything"
1206,"I don’t make small talk or anything with people in offline life, either, so basically I’m exactly how I am online as I am offline. I am part of a discord server that is predominantly male; if I see my friends on, I’ll go in and chit chat. But usually, I don’t. Not because I am afraid to. I just don’t talk much. 

I also don’t play games that depend on VC. So."
1207,"Omg yes! While I understand why a girl may be shy to speak up when there’s a guy in a vc (cuz same, duh) I don’t get it why they are so quiet and reserved when it’s just two girls in a vc. I’ve recently tried grouping up with random girls to play an online game and we decided to talk in discord. I felt awful because I was excited to finally play my favorite game with someone and I was talking, commenting, making jokes but it felt like I was just flooding the conversation. They were hard to engage and in between matches there was total silence. I’m an introvert myself irl but when it comes to video games/online conversations I find it different, safer and chiller. So yeah, I wish girls would talk more, be more confident, relaxed and engaged in conversations:)"
1208,"Omgosh I literally had this conversation with my husband. ^-^; 
What I learned is there’s a whole lot of introverts vs extroverts. That goes to say, I’m not shaming introverts, if anything I have introvert days & I definitely take advantage of it. 
Another factor is girls being harassed in game draws a feeling of discomfort and insecurities when all they want to do is enjoy their hobby just as anyone should.

Even though these are real principals here, I actually had a feeling of lonesomeness last night. (Which is why I had this conversation with my husband.) I am a social butterfly and I can get by using messenger/chat with people. But something about just playing a game with a girl without the voice chat-interaction feels like I am just playing with a computer. I just want the full experience I guess?

🌷More of me venting: 
I just miss the connection of bonding with a girl-friend who enjoys the same interests as I do, especially now that I moved veryyyy far from home. I use social media a lot to try to gain back that feeling of connection but most of the people I know actually aren’t interested in what I like and so it’s more like a “How are you” conversations and that’s about it."
1209,Someone told me once that e girls deserved to be talked down to and that other guys are only nice to us cause they want to show how manly they're.  My boyfriend a support main was called a stupid e girl and berated cause he couldnt save someone's live in high elo.
1210,I understand public which is why I clarified private because even I have reservations over public VC. Recently I've been working on my confidence with OW but I don't think I'll ever get confidemt enough to public voice chat on r6 without a friend present.
1211,"Games and Trades really bring out the sexism in some man and I really don't understand it. 

Sorry you went through that, I don't have much sexist experience to date as the last 3 ish years of my life has been on ps4 and ps4 has private parties and I haven't been able to ingame VC much due to being afraid of toxic people. 

PS3 I may have I just don't remember aside from a bunch of are you a little boy? Because I was around 8-11 ish."
1212,"Yeah, with dudes in a private vc they are mostly chatty from the get go even if its only specified to the Game but girls its so hard to get them to even chat. A lot of girls I played with were content in being completely silent and it was just so awkward."
1213,"When I speak some guys get confused, most I think catch on that I'm a girl but I still do sometimes get the are you a little boy?"
1214,"Sorry that it comes off like that to you.


If it was me then I think majority of people would probably be uncomfortable but it seems to be a girl thing in my experience. 

I am a casual gamer, I play every day and have since I was basically born but I really play games for the social aspect so someone not chatting to me is off putting and quite frankly boring. 

I was just wondering why I and even a lot of guys that are my friends experience this so it doesn't seem to be just me."
1215,I'm sorry that happened :( that sounds really awful
1216,"Ughh I feel you so hard right now, I've only connected with one girl and me and her are TIGHT so I wish I could experience that with more girls.  :("
1217,"That's awful, and I'm sorry you had to go through that. Some people truly can't enjoy a game without putting others down."
1218,"I knew what you were saying. :) 

I personally wouldn't speak if I didn't know everyone in the private party. Even if someone was a friend of a friend, I would still be a lot quieter than usual because I don't truly know that person.

I feel like this might be the result of how toxic public voice chat can be. Some women might not want to try talking to others even in a private chat because of how terrible some people can be. :("
1219,"My experience comes only from MMO on pc. Same crap in every mmo 😂 It has been going for around 15 years already. Only gw2 had nice community. 

If friends from real or mentioned husband would join then me too probably. Otherwise it's better for my mental health to stay away from it :P"
1220,Haha it happens
1221,"Because we arent all like you.  For some of us gaming is an escape from the annoying idea that women should be chatty and friendly all the time.


I game for the games, not for the social aspect and I suspect many of the people you come in contact with you do too.


I get you love the social aspect but your disdain for those of us who dont coms off pretty strongly in the way you are discussing it.  No one owes you conversation, so just move on to the next person if someone doesnt engage."
1222,":D 

That makes sense, I've at times been intimidated to speak but its not too often, its just like when my bf friends are there and they talk and I'm awkwardly in the corner like ""hi...."" 


I feel like its personal and indirect experience (you telling me your experience) as well. :("
1223,"I get it from both Electrical and Gaming at times so its an unfortunate double whammy 😣

Yeah I agree with you right there, if my friends or bf wasn't with me I'd probably just quit public vc altogether xc lol"
1224,"Then maybe they shouldn't be on apps and subreddits made for looking for friends if they don't want to put in effort to create friendships.


I'd get it if it was a random girl online but its usually a girl who has put herself out looking for friends which is where I tend to find my friends is from other people looking and I DM them.



As I have also mentioned several times I talk in PRIVATE rooms not public. So anyone who I talk to has gone through me to join or is already someones friend in the group in which case I would think they are up to talking if they joined a PRIVATE room."
1225,"With bf/husband its easier. Men dont hit on you, keep their mouth shut when its needed and watch their language. 
Its not a case when we are alone. Even on chat.
I noticed it many times. While other women with their bf/husbands had actuall peace I was on target: to hit on me, calling me for example a trap (if woman  don't join voice chat in game she is automatically a man while with men who dont want its ok ...) etc."
1226,The pro design feature is great to play around with :) Those dresses you made are so cute!
1227,"Love? I am addicted! I didn't even used the option in New leaf other than designing a flag  since I got the game late and there was pattern for all my cosplay need already.

&#x200B;

I wanted to have a nice flag for my island, then I decided I wanted to have a dress similar to Senjougahara from the monogatri series, then Melia's from Xenoblade,then Shinobu from Monogatari, then I might try myself at replicating Kiss Shot's, oh and I want the Monado on my Nookphone...

&#x200B;

Please send help... They don't even look good...

&#x200B;

By the way, your dresses are really cute. :)"
1228,Thankyou :3 it gets addicting I had to keep making dresses lol
1229,Same here I never really used the design option too much in new leaf but with new horizons it’s like game on XD my new project is making my boyfriend a sweatshirt with his fav logo on it
1230,"I like HyperX headsets a lot. Super durable, great sound, comfortable, and competitive pricing. I used to work at GameStop so I would interact with a LOT of headsets (I'd often demo them for customers) and HyperX always was the tops for me.

I would not recommend the Stingers (they're fine, but they're a budget option so they're made of plastic and are generally less comfortable than their more expensive offerings). The Cloud Cores are the next step up and can be had for around $60 usually.

If you don't like the look of the HyperX sets, Steelseries also makes decent sets, but they tend to be more expensive in my experience."
1231,"I just picked up hyperX cloud stinger because I liked the mic feature, and they ended up being a lot more comfortable than my Turtle Beach px24 (which I wouldn't recommend, but sound quality was good). I also own a hyperX quadcast mic.

So far, HyperX has been working pretty well for me.."
1232,"Diana Wynne Jones wrote a lot of fantasy with fun, optimistic energy. I really love Howl's Moving Castle, Dark Lord of Derkholm, and the Chrestomanci series from her. Her writing is pretty straightforward and my partner (who is also ESL) loves her stuff.

The Dealing With Dragons series by Patricia Werde is fun and lighthearted. It's the most ""fun fantasy"" I can think of. Kind of a Terry Pratchett ""let's make fun of fantasy because we love it so much"" energy with less of his darker criticism of humanity.

Any of Tamora Pierce's series for younger teens (Song of the Lioness, Immortals, Protector of the Small, The Circle of Magic) are a good mix of lighthearted optimism and intense realism. They can get really dark at times, but I always find that they have a very optimistic view of how good and kind human beings can be, even if some people suck.

If you don't mind watching some TV in between books, I think Star Trek (speaking mostly about the original series and The Next Generation, I haven't seen the others) has a very optimistic view of the universe. Plus it's fun to see something so old that had such a big influence on modern sci-fi! I've been watching it a lot lately and it's cheering me up. Steven Universe is also a very optimistic sci-fi TV series."
1233,"Becky Chambers' Wayfarers series. This will sound like a silly description, but it feels like... ""hang-out"" sci-fi if that makes sense? Like a large portion of these books are plotless, almost remarkably so, but the characters are so likable that it doesn't even matter. You just enjoy the mostly plot-free adventures with these characters for what they are. They're simply fun and positive books.

Station Eleven is actually one of the most lovely and optimistic books about human nature that I have ever read, but uhhh do not read this during a pandemic. Save it for a rainy day when this is all over. lol"
1234,"I'm seconding the recommendation of  The Dealing With Dragons series. That was the first that came to my mind as well.

It may be an odd recommendation, but the Star Wars novel Yoda: Dark Rendezvous is actually pretty uplifting and beautifully written. The main character is a young girl, Scout, who is training to become a Jedi, but her Force powers are very weak. Nonetheless, her strong willpower and determination help her make it through a lot of difficult situations. Even though the book also features the main heroes/villains (Yoda, Count Dooku, Anakin, Obi-Wan), there is a strong theme of ""normal/regular people accomplishing things"" that I enjoyed. Also, the book deals with Yoda wanting to redeem his former student, Count Dooku, so there is a big focus on hope and redemption. In one chapter, the main characters suffer a big loss, and the way their grieving and healing process is written is amazing and very comforting. 

If you are familiar with Star Wars (the prequel movies; the book is set between Episode 2 and 3), I can definitely recommend this book!"
1235,"If you've never read the Redwall series by Brian Jaques, they are excellent. It's a fun, anthropomorphic medieval fantasy world and I cannot recommend them enough.

Also, for something entirely different, the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher are some of my favorites. It's a modern day, fantasy detective series, but with a large scale and very intriguing metaplot. It's an ongoing series, so you may get to read the next book as it releases if you catch up before the end of the year!"
1236,"I second the Diana Wynne Jones recommendation, her Dalemark series is great too"
1237," I love Steven Universe  and I read one book by Diana Wynne Jones (Howl's Moving Castle) and it was great.  

Thank you for your recommendations!"
1238,"I second Tamora Pierce a thousand percent. Despite being a younger teen aimed series of books I read and greatly enjoyed them when I was late 20s, and reread Lioness when I was 31. So what ever your age is, they're a good read. In my opinion at least."
1239,">normal/regular people accomplishing things

oh yeah I love this theme!"
1240,He's not ugly!! He's the prettiest boi
1241,He’s so cute!
1242,Our D&D group started our campaign back up today after a 6mo hiatus! (online only ~ we're all in different time zones) Love your dice! They are so cute! And so is Plllllll!
1243,"Thanks, he’s an ugly cute little guy.

Kind of reminds me of a goblin lol."
1244,"Thank you! Plll is the perfect size with them since they’re mini 10mm.

Enjoy your adventure, DnD is such a great escape🥳"

1246,Overcooked 2 would be hilarious to play with parents. The first few levels are a nice easy introduction then the difficulty ramps up but it's SO FUN.
1247,"I bought overcooked 2 and I love it!! I hope my parents can pick it up easy.

I keep seeing gang beasts, I need to check that one out. 

Thanks for all these recs!"
1248,np! never played it but it looks like so much fun when i watch streams
1249,"I asked someone on ft date today but I hate facetiming. I honestly can't imagine a cuter quarantine date than this. I love this

 :,)"
1250,Wisp is so cuuuuute
1251,"I just saw the ghost a couple nights ago! He gave me some purple puzzle flooring for helping him. I think I ended up selling it, though. :S"
1252,I know ahh I love that he looks like Boo from Luigi’s mansion.
1253,"Yeah! I looked it up after cus it was the same with me and he asks you to help him and he’ll give you stuff in return :> he’s really cute, he reminds me of Boo from Luigi’s Mansion"
1254,"Right?? When I first met him I legit said ""OMG it's Boo!"""
1255,"That's what I was thinking when I was first saw him. I was literally thinking, ""wait, is this some weird crossover from the Mario Bros??"" Lol"
1256,"Same! Love boo, I had no idea that there were a ghost in the game so it was a super cool moment"
1257,"same haha, it was when I saw it’s face that I knew it wasn’t"
1258,borderlands!
1259,Just tried World War Z and its the exact same as L4D with some upgraded mechanics
1260,"Nice! Looks fun, which one do you recommend?"
1261,I second this! It's basically a fancier L4D!
1262,"If you care about story continuity, you could play from them in the order of 1 > 2 > Pre-sequel > Tales from the Borderlands (only one that is not an FPS) > 3.  Personally, I found Borderlands 2 to be the best in the series overall and it's great if you want something that's easy to pick up and play without story context.  It also has my all time favorite villain, so there's that too."
1263,"As a hardcore fan, I recommend starting at 2. The series really got it’s quirky personality starting in that game, the first game, while great, just doesn’t have the same feel. If you enjoy it then you can always go back. I started my girlfriend with Borderlands 2 and she loved it from there, and if you’re concerned about the story, it explains everything you need to know but I also believe PlayStation Access did a really good 8 minute recap of the first game if you want that too."
1264,"That's a good point and I admit I never finished the first game.  It's not solo-friendly and I never had any friends to play it with.  And besides that, it lacks some of the charm of the other games.  The 2nd game (and pre-sequel to some extent) do a good job of filling in the story gaps."
1265,"I don't have the Able Sisters in my town yet, but if you'd like to have the code for the pattern you can leave a comment and I'll send you a pm whenever the shop has been built :)"
1266,"Wow! I love it, great job."
1267,Ahhhh. She is my absolute favourite npc. This is so cute. 😍
1268,You are so talented! Yes I would love to front this dress in my town thank you 🥰
1269,So cute. Every screenshot I see of this game is just the most adorable thing <3.
1270,"When you do get the sisters, if you wouldn't mind sending the code, my wife really would appreciate it!"
1271,Could you send it me please? I so want to be matchy matchy with Celeste 🥺
1272,"Thanks! She's always been such a cutie, I love her and Blathers :)"
1273,"Thanks! Mabel has been in my town a few times now, so I don't think it will take too long before the shop is built :)"
1274,"Sure, I'll pm you the code as soon as I can :)"
1275,I'll send it as soon as the shop is built :)
1276,Yay thanks :)
1277,Omg is it that super high powered model?! 😯
1278,She lays like this for hours even when I’m moving my arm to hit combos lol
1279,FFXIV yeah!!!
1280,Adorable cat! Mine likes to lay on my mouse arm so I can play but have to hunt and peck to converse. Also what game is that?
1281,"It was a major splurge yeah! One of the ASUS ROG gaming laptops.

The cat is pretty high powered too when she gets hangry 😸"
1282,Aw :3. She must be super comfy then!
1283,"Haha yes my primary combos can be hit on number keys 1-4 but she gets a little in the way of anything east of WASD on the keyboard. 

It’s Final Fantasy XIV! This screen is me in my in-game house between dungeons."
1284,"😂 good one, thanks for the laugh"
1285,She’s proof that cats are both a solid and a liquid haha. She just kind of spills onto your lap
1286,"Still haven't given that game a shot yet. UI looks clean though. And from what I can see from your character, looks like the design could be good too!"
1287,"It’s the only MMO I’ve played much of. The last few expansions have had awesome story and characters, and end game glam is really really fun!!! They also recently overhauled some of the gameplay to dial back the complexity creep as far as mechanics go. There’s so much to do, it’s hard to get bored lol."
1288,Might have to check it out once I wear myself out on Mount and Blade II Bannerlord. Is there a trial option of some sort?
1289,"Slime rancher. Laid back, no failure state and you can turn off hazards completely."
1290,[Yonder](https://store.steampowered.com/app/580200/Yonder_The_Cloud_Catcher_Chronicles/) is pretty good! It’s similar to AC because it doesn’t have any enemies or time limits in it. It’s a cute game and relaxing to play. The crafting stuff is kinda tedious but other than that I really liked it.
1291,"Maybe try Littlewood on Steam? In beta, I think, but it has that cutesy factor imo."
1292,If you have a 3ds I like fantasy life and ever oasis as more cute games.
1293,"On Steam (not sure if they're on other platforms) there's stardew valley, my time at Portia, castaway paradise (the most similar to animal crossing)

Edit: oh just saw garden paws, haven't played that but it does also look like it's very similar to animal crossing"
1294,Harvest moon is nice! So is Fantasy Life. Stretching the similarity a little but I’m trying to give some different suggestions 😊
1295,If you have an android phone Harvest Town is fun. It's in beta right now so it's only available on android.
