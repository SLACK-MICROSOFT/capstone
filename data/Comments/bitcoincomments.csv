6,"When you tell people to buy bitcoin, 90% of people **actually** think that you are telling them to buy a physical coin. Trust me, this is how unaware society is. All i'm asking is for the change of bitcoin's name so that there is more awareness and adoption.

7,"> Does that mean that if i exchange my crypto salary into fiat straight away, i'll never have to pay tax? 

Not a tax advisor here, but I can pretty much assure you that is wrong.  That private sales refers to selling something on Craigslist, for example.  And it doesn't matter how you are paid, if the value received is over 600 EUR, it would be considered.  And that isn't 600 per payment.  I would bet that is 600 EUR per year, of all things that fall under the category private sales, combined."
8,"Your tax papers are expressed in EUR not in BTC.  
Your sales records are in EUR not in BTC.  
Bitcoin is just the form of payment, not the value of payment."

16,"Economics is not like physics. Ideas in physics like gravity can be defined very well using math. Ideas in economics are just observations subject to ""Animal spirits"". The same set of ideas of economics that work in one region fail very badly in others. 

Altcoins can be understood as mutations of bitcoin each proposing a slightly different improvement over existing bitcoin. Just like most mutations in biological entities die over a period, many of these Altcoins will probably die off.

Bitcoin IS part of the economy.

&#x200B;

*Or is it??*"
59,">Do your worst!

You're describing a situation where a significant proportion of the world (including, presumably, the country of China) has bought into bitcoin. Bitcoin would have succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of most here. Hurray!

So that out of the way, you then hypothesise that one participant in this economy decides to trash it - oh no! - what then, Bitcoiners???

Well, you have to explain what this has to do with bitcoin. China could easily play such games right now, if it wanted. But it wisely doesn't want to because of the certain damage it would sustain, plus the uncertain (but surely belligerent) reaction it would garner from the famously bellicose western military-industrial machine."
60,"If major economis hold on to an asset (generally to protect the economy in case of crisis)... be it gold or bitcoin... it would be a very dangerous game for that country to liquidate that asset out of the country... because the risk of losing hard assets at good price is bigger than the probability of creating instabilities in other countries... France sold a lot of gold around 2000 (probably impacting its price) but good luck to get it back now... and unfortunately for them, gold will  probably be dearly needed sooner than later"
61,"> could theoretically say China then purposefully tank the price of bitcoin for the sole purpose of a major loss in efforts to ... 

The ***could***.  But they ***could*** also launch a bunch of nukes in an effort to destabilize global economies.  Or they ***could*** flood the market with US treasuries to collapse the dollar.

There are much easier ways to mess with countries than cornering the crypto market.  Most would have much bigger tidal waves than a BTC crash.  BTC crashes all the time and you don't see revolutionaries running in the streets.  In terms of global economic warfare, BTC isn't even a blip on anyone's radar."

# For Beginners and Other Curious Creatures: A Gentle Introduction To Bitcoin

&#x200B;

**What is Bitcoin?  It is a new kind of money.**   Actually, it's just an old kind of money you're already familiar with,  but with certain improvements.  It turns out this new, improved money  has some very important properties which make Bitcoin one of the most  important inventions of all time.

At it's heart, **Bitcoin is a ledger --**  a list of transactions.  That's it.  A transaction is an event where a  person sends 'money' from one 'account' to another.  The transactions  are stored in the order in which they occurred.  The ledger is stored on  computers.

If you've ever used a  check (a paycheck, for example), or a credit card you've already used  'money' in the form of a ledger stored on computers.

So, **what makes Bitcoin different?**   Bitcoin's ledger is stored on many thousands of computers, spread  across the globe.  Anybody is free to participate.  The computers all  use the same set of 'rules' to keep the Bitcoin ledger honest, fair, and  accurate.  The rules also specify precisely how, and how much new  'money' is to be created and to whom it will belong upon its creation.   With checks and credit cards, the ledgers are kept in a relatively small  number of computers owned and operated by banks.

**Bitcoin 'money' is very, very difficult and expensive to create.**  The number of Bitcoins is strictly limited -- **there will never be more than 21 million**  Bitcoins created.  Many have already been lost forever.  This makes  each and every Bitcoin rare, and precious -- like gold, only better.   Bank ledgers keep track of fiat money.  **Fiat money is created from thin air, by merely typing numbers into a bank computer**;  fiat money is not backed by gold or anything else; fiat money is even  less precious than ""play money"" you'd find in the toy aisle of the  dollar store.  Fiat money loses value over time as the banking system  creates more and more of it.  Bitcoin gains value over time because  demand rises (as more people understand its goodness) while the supply  is strictly limited.

**Newly created Bitcoin money goes, as a reward, to people who earned it** by protecting the Bitcoin ledger (enforcing its rules, for example).  This is fair, honest, and good.  **Newly created fiat money goes to bankers and then to their cronies.**   That's right: we have a very small group of people with the ability to  create 'money' from nothing and then use it to enrich and empower  themselves and their cronies **at the expense of everybody else**,  including (but not limited to) elderly blind widows.  It turns out that  creating fiat money and using it (to buy things, to bail our broke  banks and businesses, to bribe politicians) amounts to theft.

Fiat money is inherently flawed, dishonest, unfair, bad...

**Bitcoin is honest, fair, and good.**

Furthermore,  the banks can and will cut people off from being able to use their  ledgers/fiat-money system when a government tells them to do so.  This  has already happened to whistle blowers, dissidents, and even entire  nations.  Fiat money is not only used to rob ordinary people, it is also  used as a 'weapon'.  Bitcoin is open to everybody.  Bitcoin cannot be  coerced to ""sanction"" people (whether they deserve it or not).  In  short, fiat money supports violence and theft whereas Bitcoin promotes  harmony, peace, and fairness via ""sound money"".

You are invited to join us.  So, if you're interested...

**Welcome to Bitcoin.**  I would like to encourage you to spend a little more time learning about it.  Here's an excellent video to explain the basics:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4)

An excellent book, ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" by S. Ammous.

**This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity** to participate in something which changes the world in good ways while protecting and preserving your own wealth."
109,"The miners are hashing a bunch of data (relating to the most recent block, and the potential new block), plus a number (the 'nonce'), trying to produce a hash that begins with *at least* certain number of zeroes (more zeroes as difficulty goes up). Every time they try & fail, they change the nonce & try again. The number of zeroes required is automatically adjusted to keep blocks coming every 10 minutes, on average.

When a miner eventually succeeds in finding such a hash, they submit it to the network for validation. Assuming it is valid, all the other miners then begin again, looking for the next block in the same way. The successful miner is rewarded with newly minted bitcoin (currently 12.5 btc per block), plus transaction fees."
110,"Every time a block is validated, the person who contributed the necessary computational power is given a block reward in the form of new-minted BTC and transaction fees.

&#x200B;

Transaction fees are issued to miners as an incentive to continue validating the network. By the time 21 million BTC has been minted, transaction volume on the network will have increased significantly and miners' profitability will remain roughly the same."
111,"you need to understand nonce, hashing and merkle trees, to explain it properly. otherwise you're doing your students a disservice."
112,No miners calcuate functions to run the network and process transactions. They are rewarded new bitcoin on the network as a reward to processing information for the bitcoin ledger
113,"As from your own explanation, doesn't look you are a ""computer science"" teacher, but just a poor student.  
A teacher, even after reading quickly the [Satoshi's papers](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) will understand and be able to explain in few words, how Bitcoin mining works.

116,">Transaction fees are issued to miners as an incentive to continue validating the network. By the time 21 million BTC has been minted, transaction volume on the network will have increased significantly and miners' profitability will remain roughly the same.

126,It's good trolling etiquette to bow out once you've been called out.
127,"Sure. It's like this:

Imagine you're Melania Trump. Barron is out in the yard playing and you're once again staring down a bottle of pills contemplating ending the nightmare existence that is your life. President Trump calls and demands to see some nudes because he has some ""bigly dick energy"" he needs to disperse, pronto. He threatens divorce if you don't deliver within five minutes and hangs up. You race to the bathroom and disrobe, fearing the financial exile and destitution that will surely follow if you do not satisfy Lord Cheeto immediately. As you start snapping shots of your plastic-injected body, you get a text from Ivanka telling you she just dropped a cool 15 mil on a solid gold vibrator and wants to get you one. Suddenly realizing you haven't sent the pics yet, you fire them off and hope it's enough to keep Mango Man busy while you inform your daughter that you do, in fact, want one and ask her to buy it immediately.

Ok so Barron is the unconfirmed transactions, Donald Trump is the blockchain, Melania is the PoW required to satisfy the nonce and I have completely forgotten where I was going with this"

129,"Yes, and since they don't teach ""computer science"" to third graders... the OP is probably just a troll."

179,"Most online places require you to be 18+ to start an account.  So one option would be to have someone you trust purchase them and then transfer them to a wallet that you control.  You might be able to find a bitcoin ATM that will let you purchase with a debit card, there is usually a premium added on those so make sure the price is reasonable."
180,"If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

You indicated that you would like to maintain your financial privacy (i.e., by not revealing your age), and that you would like to pay using either debit card or PayPal.  

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card.  I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., Rebiton [**NO-KYC**], CoinCorner [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], CEX.io, Coinify, Jubiter, Bittylicious, BitIreland, Kuna.io Money, LiteBit.eu, Conio.com, GetSatsoshi.org ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), Cash App and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

There are also physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  <-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:   There are some sellers on No-KYC P2P exchanges that accept PayPal, others that accept debit card, etc. 

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro  <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).   These methods will likely require identity verification / KYC though.

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method.  These methods will likely all require identity verification/KYC.

- https://exchangewar.info  <-- Filter box for currency (e.g., EUR) or payment method (e.g., VISA)

There's always the friends and family methods.  Someone you know probably holds bitcoin and would be willing to help you out by selling to you."
181,"There are only a few exchanges that accept PayPal due to it being easily reversed:

- xCoins.io
- VirWOX
- CanCoin.com
- Upcoin.com
- eToro: You can fund an account on eToro and buy a bitcoin position.  But you cannot withdraw those bitcoins, and instead you can only later sell and withdraw the cash (including trading gains, or minus trading losses).

183,"**Credit card**

A credit card is a payment card issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts plus the other agreed charges. The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance.

A credit card is different from a charge card, which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers to build a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged.

189,"My [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e08atv/why_use_hardware_wallets_over_paper_wallets/f8cp8da/) to a similar question

***

Most risk isn't in storing the seed... its recovering the seed.  Any time a private key is given to an operating system you are at risk until the funds that key is releasing are confirmed in a block.  You may have mad ninja skill OPSEC, but I always assume that no computer or OS (even tails or Raspbian) is secure.  Maybe it's secure enough for a $100 UTXO, or a $1000 UTXO.  But what happens in 50 years when those UTXOs are worth millions.

When you use Raspbian, you basically say ""I trust the guys that developed this not to steal my keys"" or at least ""I trust random strangers to read all their code and validate it"".  Problem is that Raspbian is literally millions of lines of code.  Something like coldcard and trezor are 100x or 1000x smaller codebase.  Less code to attack, less code to review.  Higher confidence.

In my opinion... The two things a HW wallet does better than anything else are:

1. Generating a seed in a way that is disguised from the operating system.
2. Using a key to sign a TXN in a way that is disguised from the operating system.

For the years that your HOLDring , I think it matters not whether that thing in your safety depoist box is a laminated paper wallet or a laminated seed, passphrase, derivation-path.

PS... Shamir's Shared Secret is also cool."
190,"Even an old smartphone, kept offline can do exactly the same what is doing a HW.  
You could create the tx offline, sign it, on any wallet that support that feature. Then take the tx signed, paste it in a txt file that you can open it in whatever other wallet and broadcast it.  
You could send the txt through Bluetooth or Wifi share between 2 phones (one offline, one online).

223,Won't be a bad idea to remove coins sooner.  Make sure you have a chair before the music stops especially dealing with a shady exchange.
224,"What exactly should I be planning for. I have coins on an exchange (very little) Bitfinex and some on iPhone apps called Coinbase, bread, Litewallet. Anything I need to do with them?"

228,"the concept is to claim your bitcoin keys. in your case it would be to move your coins from Bitfinex to your bread wallet. (not sure if Coinbase wallet gives you your keys and never heard of Litewallet)

make sure you have your bread wallet backup phrase before you send your coins. wipe your wallet and check if you can restore it. then send a small amount and check if you can receive it.

BTW you don't have to do it on Jan 3. the date is just a reminder. do it whenever your comfortable but try not to procrastinate and prove you own your bitcoin."

237,How is Iran going to stop musk from beaming internet from space on to Iran?
238,Iran once did orbital jamming from its embassy in Cuba. it could also use a ballistic missile and take down the satellites. Either of the cases will disrupt the internet for other countries too

243,"I know that my answer sounds more harsh but this is the plain fucking truth: I never ""give away"", ""donate"", ""tip"" BTC to anybody. If they do not give or make something in exchange for my BTC, don't even think about it.  
I do not care if is for a good cause or salvation of humanity. My BTC are MY BTC.  
Why? Simple:  
1. My BTC are earned hard, for the past 8 years.  
2. Each one of my BTC means MY FREEDOM. Each time I would ""give"" (for nothing) to somebody I would give a part of my freedom. Freedom is very hard to earn nowadays. Who want it should work hard for it.  
3. Nowadays, BTC gets too valuable to be given for free. Those times when everybody were throwing around with BTC are GONE.  
4. All these ""donations"" pledges are mostly scams, begging for obscure sites, that absolutely nobody can track where the money goes or how they are used.  
5. If I really want to help a person in need I will do it directly and in private, not through any bloodsucker false ""organization"" or ""foundation"".  
6. Any of these cases for donations are in fact the result of fucking bad govs and banksters plans to decimate/enslave people. These should be the ones to pay for any disaster, crime, people in need, because they are the ones that created in the first place, not me. So please do not ask me to pay for other gov/bankster did!  
7. I never heard of how started this bullshit ""giving tuesday"" Is just a bullshit story to make people empathize and give away.  

Please stop all these begging!"

&#x200B;

Bitcoin ***IS*** money.

An excellent introductory video:  

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4)  

An excellent book, ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" by S. Ammous."
258,"If you're interested, feel free to message me. I created a YouTube account to help out my fellow Canadians get into crypto. You can check out my channel here if you're interested: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnq\_SR0vRPYjedeYWWdWjIg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnq_SR0vRPYjedeYWWdWjIg)"
259,Not sure if King is the right title...
260,Get ready for  big government to present new laws because of this SJW. Complete idiot
261,"The government does not want to stop bitcoin. They had a very populistic opportunity to do it after the bubble of 2017.
The people in power want bitcoin to become big and they are now probably accumulating. They are just against teaching bitcoin, especially to foreigners and enemies."
262,Lol imagine thinking the government needs laws to repress you
263,"Yeah, the government is so much for bitcoin they tax buying/selling/ transferring/converting/forks/airdrops with a hefty capital gains tax if you send or trade quickly.  Yeah they love it so much!"
264,This clown just provides another “logical” reason for them to do so.
265,"You are trading, they are accumulating. When they will want to start trading, they will drop the tax on trading.

""The government"" is just a bunch of rich people that want to get richer. After they finish accumulating, they will destabilise the economy and promote bitcoin as the invention of the century, find some political/ideological excuse for why it shouldn't be taxed (i.e. ""If we tax bitcoin, all the trade will move to china and the communist party will become rich!""), and those rich people will brag over how they were so smart to see the future and accumulate secretly.

You barely hear them saying anything in favour of bitcoin, and you barely hear them saying anything against bitcoin. I refuse to believe that the people in power simply don't have an opinion about bitcoin. I refuse to believe that they didn't notice that bitcoin is still alive and kicking. They will simply use bitcoin as another tool to screw the working class."
266,It's already criminalized so that makes no difference
267,"Exactly, which will call for more ridiculous laws"
268,Those don't matter since they just make up shit as they go already to get people and if you truly believe in the liberatory nature of btc then you should be hailing any government clamp down as an encouraging sign of desperation and their slipping control of the economy.
269,"Just means the bitcoin market and price discovery mechanism are maturing.    

Bakkt's bitcoin-settled futures product is particularly of interest because it is less able to create short-term ""manipulations"" of bitcoin's spot price on exchanges.  This is because bets placed on bitcoin which don't involve trading actual bitcoin can be much larger than the relatively small bitcoin market overall can handle in terms of liquidity on exchanges.  So because bitcoin is a small market compared to other legacy markets, and compared to the wealth held by top global investors, this means bitcoin's spot exchange price can be ""manipulated"" short term by placing large bets in the cash-settled futures, and derivative markets, and only needing to place a relatively small trade on a major bitcoin exchange to temporarily move the price a large enough amount to make huge profits on their derivative trade (since derivative market contracts are based on bitcoin spot price).      

The unfortunate catch is that powerful legacy traders actually like to be able to manipulate in this way, so they have no interest in bitcoin-settled futures.  That's why it's good to see the bitcoin-settled futures increasing in volume.  Really though, Bakkt's bitcoin-settled futures product should just be seen as another bitcoin exchange in terms of its ""influence"".   

  Ideally what we want to see is the liquidity in bitcoin-settled futures, and the liquidity in spot bitcoin exchange grow to counter-act the manipulative power the derivatives market currently has.    

It's growing pains of an immature market, and immature price discovery mechanism."
270,It means we told you so. Folks who thought Bakkt was a flop when it launched are looking like clowns . It means that big institutions and accredited investors are Bakk-ing up the trucks to stack major sats at low low prices. BTFD! The halving is about 150 days out and folks at Bakkt / ICE plan to make some serious Corn next year and those of us who have HODL strong no weak hands will be rewarded.
271,Weeeeew thanks for that :)
272,Winner!!!
273,Why does it matter if it is legal or not?
274,"it's at the same time impossible to use it 'in california'. 

you use bitcoin within its network which is global yet borderless and you have no tools to affect the geography of the TX.

case in point, if a citizen of china sends btc to a us citizen, are we saying that bitcoin was transferred from china to us? Their legal framework and its reality exists outside of bitcoin. 

any ban on bitcoin's use would have to make it formally illegal to sign a transaction locally, which would be a bitch to prove and cheap to circumvent."
275,It's legal to use (almost) everywhere in the world. No US states have banned it.  The Islamic and authoritarian socialist states tend to be against it.  There are few outright bans though. Usually they just restrict exchange operators because they know they can't really stop people from using it or even mining it small scale.
276,Everything is legal in Unicornia!
277,Yes.
278,I like the way you think.
279,"Sorry for unrelated question, how does bitcoin ATM work in terms of conveying BTC to money. How is that different from going through localbitcoins.com and sell."
280,"Bitcoin IS money, a new kind of money."
281,Ok right I was just wondering what the difference is by using bitcoin atm to cash vs selling bitcoin for cash. Pros and cons of both?
282,"If in doubt, use Bitrefill to buy gift cards."
283,lawyers are the real manipulators
284,"Do you mean ""unmined"" instead of ""yet to be purchased""? If so, nobody owns them, since those coins do not exist yet. The miner who mines them, will own them."
285,hehe that's funny. i've never seen anyone ask this. it's really not a completely ridiculous question...
286,"They don't exist yet, except in the sense that the bitcoin protocol allows for newly created bitcoin to be awarded to miners, whenever they find blocks."
287,"You're lacking some basic understanding.  I'd like to encourage you to learn some basics:

An excellent book, ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" by S. Ammous.

An excellent video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4)"
288,They haven't been mined yet. Nobody owns them.
289,"You own couple of coins and don't even know basic stuff? And people get mad when I say most ""investors"" are basically gamblers..."
290,"It's a great question and I hope you've since found more about how it all works and how BTC has a pretty fair method of distribution.

Many other coins are pre-mined so yes a single entity owns them and thus holds unreasonable sway over the system.  People do not seem to question this enough."
291,"you have **a lot** of reading to do. Welcome to the rabbit hole.

https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html

https://nakamotoinstitute.org/"
292,"I have them. They are stored on a memory stick. Don't worry, they are encrypted with a password and the computer is not connected to the internet. Whenever a miner successfully mines a block, I print the bitcoin and send it to him with a fax machine. This job is really tedious, I hope the bitcoin committee will find someone to replace me soon."
293,"I say purchase because I've only purchased mine, never mined any...where are they kept until they are mined, and who maintains that holding account?"
294,"i didn't get as many ""straight"" answers other than ""yet to be mined""  :( not sure I was asking questions in the right way"
295,"so the 21M initially created by satoshi are left to be ""found"" by miners?"
296,"Thank you, I was exploring the possibility of asking a community where  folks who ""dont lack the basic understanding"" I do could answer in a concise manner."
297,"so where are they kept until they are mined? ""hidden"" and waiting to be found? (for lack of a better term from me)"
298,"been okay so far and having fun with it, thats for sure. 

You sure people even care when you call ""investors"" gamblers and it's not your ego thinking that? 

&#x200B;

Dont we all (investors) inherently know were gambling, whether it be crypto, real estate, or stocks?"
299,"Oh, i see what you did there.."
300,">where are they kept until they are mined

They don't exist until they're mined, hence they cannot be kept anywhere."
301,They’re kept in the matrix...
302,">i didn't get as many ""straight"" answers other than ""yet to be mined

That's as straight as you can get :)  

Where is a car located before it gets built? We can go into a philosophical debate about what constitutes a ""car"" and what it means to exist (which is fun, too), but for all practical purposes it is fair to say that a car doesn't exist (and thus cannot have a location) until it is built, and the entity who builds that car owns it.  

It's exactly the same with an unmined bitcoin (although it's a digital good instead of a physical one)."
303,"how many answers do you need? they don't exist yet. end of story.  

 if you want to know how bitcoin works in general, there are plenty of resources out there. no need to recreate the wheel."
304,"When miners mint new coins the coins come into existence at that point. When they create a block, the miner essentially pays themselves 12.5 new coins that they themselves just created right then. But it works because this is in line with the consensus algorithm. If they tried to award themselves 100 coins the block would be rejected by the rest of the network.

We're all counting up to 21 million along an agreed trajectory, and new coins are created at the moment of mining provided it is the expected amount."
305,"It's really a philosophical question regarding when/how bitcoin are created. Did all 21m exist as soon as Satoshi imagined them? Or when the first code was written? Or when the network was established (e.g. from the second block onward)? Or upon the finding of each block? Or do we wait for some arbitrary number of blocks to be built on top of the block in question, before saying they exist? Reorgs can happen after all.

From different perspectives, any/all of these can be true."
306,Did you understand the answers you were given? None?  Some?  All?
307,"Don’t come here and be rude. Once you understand how mining works and the generation of new coins you will look back at your question and cringe. 

Even watching a couple of YouTube videos would have got you ahead of the game here."
308,"No they don’t even exist. They are generated as a reward for miners. Whichever miner solves the block (or whichever mining pool, more realistically these days), is rewarded with 12.5BTC. The first transaction in a block is called a ‘coinbase’ transaction and adds 12.5BTC to their wallet. This is NOT sent from another wallet, but simply generated afresh. 

Imagine mining for gold except the gold wasn’t actually in the ground until you found it. Freaky huh. 

Any attempt to include more than 12.5 BTC in the coinbase transaction will result in the block being rejected by nodes, and whichever other miner provides a correct block with the correct coinbase amount will be accepted."
309,"They literally don’t exist yet. They aren’t anywhere. When a miner mines a block, they get awarded the new Bitcoin, and it goes into whatever address they specify (along with all of the fees from the mined transactions)."
310,this is probably the best answer I got; it makes sense but brings up a ton of other questions i cant hit you all with
311,wow...thank you for this. Pretty digestible way for someone with a rudimentary understanding to get this info...thank you
312,damn...those are all good questions too!! (and forsure will come across my mind when i get home and pack a fat bowl)
313,"getting through them now, a couple of them made sense in theory but understanding the nuts and bolts about how they are accounted for at a number of 21M beause satoshi said it was; but about how miners can pay themselves for blocks they ""found"" is something im still trying to grasp"
314,"lol not sure if thats to me or the homie up there but im not trying to be rude, apologies if you were offended"
315,"MY favorite answer so far, other answers touched on this but you explained the mining and reward of 12.5....no one wants to go through the work to mine or find the block then overvalue it like an asshole and be rejected by the community. 

&#x200B;

Quick question:

&#x200B;

are there a certain number of blocks to be mined? or infinite available and a certain amount to be filled for a particular chain...for example, If i mine a block and try to make it worth 100 bitcoin and it gets rejected by nodes, do you then have a chance to remine the same block i mined and mis-priced or do you find/create/mine another available block and price it right thus reserving one of the finite blocks in the chain?  IF it doesnt work anything like this, i wont have my feelings hurt to hear that answer either lol"
316,"Thats pretty rad actually; is there a scavenger hunt going on to find blocks or is it basically a game of ""fastest computer finds and mines"""
317,"It's a protocol - an agreed upon set of rules.  If a computer doesn't follow the rules, he doesn't get to play."
318,It kind of is like that. Computers are competing with each other to solve a mathematical puzzle sort of. That’s not a perfect analogy but it suffices to explain it. Those with more computational power are more likely to solve a block than those with less.
319,"Thank you for this explanation, however basic it seems to you it actually really expanded my understanding of what exactly im investing in. I appreciate your time"

>While Bitfinex and Tether assured they are separate companies, the Paradise Papers leaks in November 2017 showed that 2 Bitfinex officials were responsible for setting up a Tether Holdings in 2014. This is later confirmed by a spokesperson which states that the CEO of both firms is Jan Ludovicus van der Velde.

>Tether has failed to provide third party audit results of its accounts, despite promising in 2017. Instead a balance sheet on Tether’s official website claims to provide a complete and transparent listing of all its accounts.

>Since the beginning of Tether the most important rule was, that Tether is always backed 1 to 1 by US Dollars. Even tough those funds might not be confirmed to exists there was kind of a security, that the company has enough balance to buy all coins back.

>**On March 15, 2019, this was quietly changed, so that there do not have to be an equivalent in US Dollars but the Tether commits itself to back up all 2.8 billion Tether with all kinds of currencies, e.g. US Dollars, cryptocurrencies and “other assets and receivables from loans”. As it was always unsure weather Tether had the backup for their currency, this change was a huge hit to Tether’s credibility.**"

by all means you can get away with it, but it's silly to say ""you'd have to be dumb to get caught"".  you'd have to be very smart to successfully pull it off.  at a minimum, all of your procedures and policies will be audited for wrongdoing, and *someone* will be held liable for those.  they will absolutely find out *how* the funds got stolen.  and once that person gets thrown under the bus and is facing their own charges, they very well might sing.  

people are unpredictable.  some developer was promised a handsome jackpot for letting the breach happen, but soon finds themselves at the shit end of an investigation & blamed by the company they are covering for.  they find themselves & their family & friends under severe scrutiny while they sort out very scary consequences.  they have no way of secretly cashing in on their stolen funds, all accounts are monitored for suspicious payments.

500,"But they already MADE the revenue, so they still have to pay on the full 100m. Assume that the 100m in your example is amount Y and the 30m are amount X. You can’t just deduct amount X because you got hacked for amount X, and then pay taxes on amount Y-X. You will still have to pay taxes for amount Y! That’s not how taxation works!

Edit: There MIGHT be something like “lost collateral” or whatever to claim as a loss and reduce your tax burden, but you can be damn sure that there’s a limit on that and I’m sure it’s not high."
501,"Here is a simplified scenario.  You make $100-million in net income and pay $30-million in taxes.  If you have a $30-million loss that would mean $70-million in net income, so you would still owe $21-million in taxes. 

But, that is assuming that you don't have insurance to repay the loss.  Also, if the amount of taxes were announced as owed, that would mean the loss a few days later would be applied to next years net income, so it wouldn't effect the taxes already owed and especially would NOT be a one-to-one write-off of current taxes owed.

The only conspiracy I could see surrounding the coincidental amounts is if they had insurance proceeds and used them to pay the taxes and then embezzled the ""hacked"" funds."
502,"There is a limit though. I believe IRS allows you to claim up to $2,000/yr in lost collateral (applies to stocks & crypto)

If they magically recover the amount, then they will have to declare it and pay taxes on entire 30m.

Both of those guides require cheap, dedicated hardware which can run 24/7 (so you don’t need to sync up your node after it has been off for a while).

606,Whats the catch here.. doesnt say beta or testnet anywhere.. this is yuge???
607,hmm... that's too long.
608,I was about to ask.  That's good news for anyone that wants to use bitfinex but is worried about their solvency:  it sounds like this will let you rapidly get coins in and out of the exchange to minimize your exposure without minimizing your ability to trade.
609,What’s the TPS with a 32 MB block anyways? I just don’t understand their long term vision.
610,"u/memorydealers claims to be a businessman and investor-- I wonder what he'd say about this case study:

One business has a quarterly revenue of $19 million dollars, another which considers itself a competitor has revenue that barely clears $7 thousand dollars in the same quarter with significantly fewer users and very significantly lower revenue per user. Both currently have vaguely similar operating expenses but latter has increased upside risk for its future operating expenses. The second business has no demonstrated argument how it will overcome the fact that its primary differentiator essentially guarantees extremely low revenue per user. 

Which of these businesses is likely more valued by its customers? Which of these businesses appear to be more viable?

Bitcoin isn't a business-- for sure, but no effort of man is shielded from economic realities. Bitcoin has a demonstrated viable model for paying the considerable cost of security without demanding inflation while staying decentralized. ""Cryptocurrencies"" that promote themselves on free or almost free transactions sacrifice security, decentralization, or both. ... and if someone wants to user a currency that isn't cryptographically secure or decentralized-- and many people do-- there are plenty of widely adopted traditional financial networks."

626,"They are 2 different networks.

They have to do the conversion for you in the background"

633,are there any limits for deposit/withdrawl? i heard the 0.xx btc channel limit is a client/software setting. Would this enable cheap 50btc+ deposit/withdrawl?
634,Couldn't miners just use the smallest block size and fill the mempool to get higher fees?
635,"Wow. Thats amazing.

I tried to vote but I kept getting warnings"
636,No they are not. Lightning is just a layer above bitcoin. They could also just add / subtract from your bitcoin balance whenever you deposit/withdraw via lightning. I also expect that it simply has to do with their internal architecture as u/prof7bit suggested.
637,"Having many implementations handy is useful in case you need to use one exclusively. It would be pretty awesome to load balance between each implementation, but realistically you'd use one and keep the other up to-date-as-possible-but-probably-gets-left-behind in case of an emergency.

On one project we had multiple ways to do reverse geolocation in case we needed to switch if one vendor went nuts with pricing."
638,"I didn’t say it was bad. There will be some use cases in the future for which it makes a lot of sense, and this development will help it get there. This application itself won’t really make lightning super useful though IMO.

But maybe I’m wrong. Maybe if blocks get full and fees get high again, this will be how you want to withdraw/deposit your BTC from them"
639,"If it makes you happy, it can't be that bad"

Withdrawal fees for 50BTC are relatively cheap anyway. Its a fixed cost"

I'm afraid they are different networks. There will be many different L2 networks that interact with the main BTC settlement layer.

Liquid is a different network too."
644,In software development trying this instead of focusing on one tends to cause more headaches than it fixes.
645,Arb traders are drooling at this idea.  Instant settlement between pairs across Lightning exchanges... my god!

Thanks."
647,Yeah you'll have to weigh whether it's appropriate to make some kind of abstraction layer.
648,"Eh... maybe. Arb traders stand to make more money when exchange spreads are greater.

With instant cross exchange settlement, spreads are less likely to exist at all. The people making the arbitrage money will be the exchanges themselves."

670,"I'm a programmer by trade so I use OpenSCAD for my 3d designs. I used [this library](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1659079) to generate the thread. I then used a set of calipers to measure the thread diameter (the width of the bolt), and thread pitch (the space between the screw threads), and I counted the number of windings. I chucked this all into OpenSCAD and added a small foot, and job done. If it helps, here is the OpenSCAD source code for the dishwasher foot:

    use <Threading.scad>

    thread_diameter = 17.5;
    thread_pitch = 4;
    thread_windings = 19;
    foot_height = 10;
    foot_diameter = 30;

    cylinder(d=foot_diameter, h=foot_height);

    translate([0, 0, foot_height]) {
        threading(pitch = thread_pitch, d=thread_diameter, windings = thread_windings, angle = 60, full = true);
        cylinder(d=14.5, h=82);
    }

To render it in OpenSCAD, you will need to download the library I linked above, and place the two .scad files (naca_sweep and threading) into your [OpenSCAD libraries directory](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Libraries#Library_Locations). Then you can fire up OpenSCAD, paste the above code in, and press F5 for a preview. F6 to render and F7 to export as STL."
