13,Yes it is but you are not in the DW make a blank to the ammount of purchase because chain analysis can track your transaction easily! You're fucked and you can't withdrawal to your regular wallet right?

29,"The Bitcoin Core code has had many updates. For any number of these, a person can choose to not like the change and consider it as ""no longer being Bitcoin"" with the change. For example, SegWit was a big one that people didn't like, but each forking camp has its own specific change (or set of changes) they don't like and consider any code with the change as no longer being Bitcoin."
30,I am in neither camp. Why would any of them respond to you if they will get heavily downvoted?
31,"no one gets out,  not even the winner"
32,I'm stupid and I don't understand much of any of this. I just know one feels like gold and one feels like cash.
33,Maybe a stupid question. But what chain does it sync to
34,"No. You’re welcome to not like the change, but you’re delusional if you no longer recognize it as bitcoin. That’s not how life works. 

I’m not a fan of Lebron James. I wish the Lakers never got him. I no longer root for the Lakers. But they’re still the Lakers, no matter what I think."
35,"Ahhh, thank you very much. I feel the argument of being the original bitcoin would be better made leading with the fact that bitcoin has been updated beyond recognition (from their viewpoint)."

43,"Don't you have get paid 9% of your wage  into super?

Or are you a contractor and you don't pay yourself super?"
44,"The latter. From prior to contracting, I was stuck with a Super that I couldn't really use for anything but insurance, so I use it for exactly that now and take care of my retirement savings myself."
45,"I see.. that's a good idea. Unfortunately I've never been a contractor so it's not an option ( yet)

46,"A lot of jerks, sex offenders and idiots are also there. I mean it's good news but nothing that I'd sit and let it sink for any amount of time"
47,"I let it sink in.  

Nothing."
48,"It sank. Not surprising considering the ""bitcoin exchange"" is ran by the company behind the NYSE. She won't pump your bags."
49,So much for getting money out of politics
50,"It won't change much in the immediate term. She's in Trump's party, and Trump made it very clear Bitcoin is a threat to the USD's reserve currency status (although Trump is damaging that more through trade wars and tariffs than Bitcoin is).  

Regardless, she won't break ranks in an election year, nor is she there to push a pro-crypto agenda. She's the wife of the NYSE owner, after all.  
She's there to make sure Wall St. gets its say, not Bitcoin."
51,"It means nothing, what's this moron trying to imply?"
52,The only thing I see sinking is the price of BTC.
53,She's a bit of a milf.
54,Sounds like typical Corporate/DC revolving door bullshit to me.
55,Let’s see which wins: crypto or politics.
56,"It's not a ""Bitcoin exchange"". If you think it is, you really don't understand Bitcoin or Bakkt.

Although I do think it's interesting that the media hasn't really touched on the Bitcoin/cryptocurrency aspect at all. All of the articles just say she's CEO of a financial company."
57,"She also fully supports Trump and his wall.

""While Loeffler said she was ""pro-Trump,"" and in favor of his border wall, the Second Amendment and against abortion and socialism, she did not address crypto or bitcoin in her introductory remarks."""
58,Nothing will happen
59,I live in Georgia. She is the CEO of bakkt. Bakkt is owned by ICE. ICE owns NYSE and I believe they are the 3rd largest behind CME and Hong Kong. Both ICE and Bakkt are based here in Atlanta.
60,"Both a CEO and an senator are both positions of power.  Just because they are one in the same is not nessisarly a good sign for crypto.  Remember that there's an revolving door problem with government and industry.

This more likely spells corruption or a way to nueter crypto."
61,"It's easy to profit from this, just short BTC when you see any highly anticipated event from any major institutions about bitcoin. Just look at the Bakkt launch, many trader thought it was going to moon.

It's their way of controlling, they want to suppress the price of BTC, but BTC will eventually moon, it's only a matter of time before the catapult launches, the price action will be astronomical. The longer the resist, the higher the pump."
62,It sank in... and den?
63,And the host of a reality TV show is the US President. Who cares?
64,Imagine when you will have a president who is pro bitcoin.... day of reckoning
65,[Let this sink in](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1985991742_10.jpg)
66,"You're correct about her in relation to crypto and Wall Street. She's solidly in the Wall Street camp. Bakkt futures are holding BTC prices down and it seems she's totally ok with that. She's not a true crypto advocate. 

But as for Trump: Trump didn't want her. He asked the GA governor for someone else and didn't get his choice. Kelly is a very moderate Republican, like Isaacson who she's filling in for, or like Paul Ryan. They don't like Trump. My guess is that she'll be voted out next year when that senate seat is up for reelection, and the current GA governor will lose in the next primaries to someone more favorable to Trump."
67,"You must not be informed, most of the Congressional blockchain caucus are Republicans. Hell is was co founded by Mick Mulvaney. Both parties support blockchain and Bitcoin. Politics is getting in the way. Currently, that is Maxine Waters blocking the house blockchain bills like the token taxonomy act. Which has bipartisan support."
68,Macaffee bout to eat them nuts and guts.

71,"If you can exchange ""things"" for bitcoin there then it's by all means a bitcoin exchange my guy."

106,Patently false
107,"> What did your coin do this year, besides go up and down at the whim of whales?

In 2019, Monero:

- created an entirely new PoW algorithm, RandomX, to eliminate ASICs permanently

- implemented encrypted communication with remote nodes for additional privacy

- enforced subaddresses to further improve user privacy by standardizing transactions

- made massive UX strides on the mobile front with Cake Wallet, Monerujo, and X wallet adding new features, while WooKey Wallet and Coinomi implemented Monero this year

- reduced transaction size and verification time for greater efficiency

- added native support for Tor/i2p transaction relays for greater privacy

All of this *without* a corporation controlling the changes."
108,"The problem is that whatever strides XRP may have made toward ""adoption"" are a tiny fraction of the promises Ripple has made over the last 3 years.

Those promises were baked into XRP's speculative value, so when Ripple achieves 10% of what they promised (for instance their promise of **""many major banks will be using XRP by the end of 2019!""**) , then its speculative value actually goes ***down***...as we've seen."

Just like monero, anyone of free to develop whatever they like using the XRP ledger, Ripple is just one company that is heavily utilizing it to their benefit to develop software to provide a usecase. Honestly what is the purpose of bashing XRP just to jump on the tribalism train, monero targets a completely different usecase, it's literally apples and oranges comparing with XRP. I just don't understand why people can't be happy for a commercial use of cryptocurrency gaining adoption when the majority of other cryptocurrencies make the whole technology seem like a joke."

I for sure don‘t see XRP as a blatant scam, in my opinion it could be even more useful to the masses than BTC. As i said, getting tired of maximalists shitting on anything not bitcoin, thats all."
122,"Ok bro, you sound like you really know your shit. Thanks for enlightening me.

RemindMe! 2 years"
123,"It’s use case is centered around transferring value which it is doing right now. The main use case for XRP is to move fiat $ around the world as fast as you can send an email or a txt message. Incase you haven’t noticed the world still transacts in fiat the last time I checked and I don’t see it going anywhere in the near future.

If you don’t see value in that then good for you move on with your life. I don’t get why everything in crypto is a competition. I now remembered why I stay away from this toxic sub with a bunch of fan boys (I’m not excluding XRP fanboys from this either) there are a lot of different crypto’s with many different use cases. We will see in 5 years time which ones survived. I put my money on the one with the big centralized company behind it driving adoption."
124,Nothing wrong with dreaming friend. But I recommend you reconsider which cryptocurrencies will potentially give you ‘big gains.’ I don’t think ripple will be one of them.
125,"There's no ""potential gains"". It's a pump & dump scam.

I'm sure the law enforcements will get better and better tracking down people who deal with illegal stuff via crypto. Wouldn't surprise me if we saw some kind of decentralized marketplace like Silkroad taking place again eventually, this time with no real owner, making it impossible to stop. They'd have to take down all the nodes, which is next to impossible. Pure speculation though.   


Overall I believe decentralization will be the next big focus point for everyone in crypto, including trading. It pisses me off with all these exchange scandals. Exit scamming exchanges, hacked exchanges, exchanges delisting projects as they please, freezing peoples funds and the list goes on and on.

Critically, EY has a substantial team of 200 people working on building the software modules for making the Ethereum blockchain useful for enterprise, and it is positioned to bring about a transition from enteprise transactions being  governed by traditional legal contracts to being conducted via self-executing hard code on the mainnet, because it works closely with numerous Fortune 500 companies as part of its role as a Big Four accounting firm.

This is not to say that the revolution where everyone migrates to Ethereum for conducting and entering into financial/commercial transactions and agreements, respectively, is just around the corner - there is still a lot of work ahead and development needed - but it is potentially being brought forward many years by EY's commitment to it."

""That"", being an ecologically sustainable coin (I assume you mean something like Nano, since they like to advertise themselves as ""green"" cause no PoW etc) including privacy (edit: by default) like Monero.

I follow a project called Tangram, which aims to do just that. It's still in development, and they have had their fair share of delays and drawbacks, so nothing is less sure than it happening in the end.

But the devs give themselves the means to do it, albeit slowly, they are IMO the ones, out of all those aspiring ""private Nano"" projects, that hype least and are most cypherpunk in essence, and 65% of total supply will eventually be distributed for free. Might attract your curiosity who knows."

So, what are your options for spending $9bn in gold? It's basically the same answer in that you can convert it to whatever currency you choose and then transact. Just that BTC is far cheaper to transact than gold."

238,"If you spent $9B without a drop in purchasing power you would be buying something enormous IE a large bank or a small Island Nation.

Funds were moved by Bittrex to different wallets btw. Market based transaction fees would not apply here."
242,He meant in fiat
243,that's obviously not true since transactions even larger than that take place in fiat all the time. like buying real estate or businesses. i'm sure the fees are much more than $12.50 but the transaction absolutely can happen.

247,"Bitcoin is not a store of value, so we have to recognize that right out of the gate. If you want to compare it against gold, that’s fine. The total value of gold is over $7 trillion, you can spend $9b in gold and gold will still be fine, it has incredible amounts of liquidity. 

Meanwhile $9b in bitcoin value won’t get you anywhere close to $9b in actual value if you try to spend it. 2017 bull run was caused by less than $9b, so imagine how hard it would be to sell/use without demolishing the price."
248,Upvote for the Lil Dickey reference.
249,We can compare bitcoin to bitconnect too.
250,No need to limit yourself to one commodity. Reality is that you can buy $9b worth of goods in usd and $1 can still buy $1 worth of goods. Try spending $9b in bitcoin and suddenly that .1 btc buys a whole of a lot less. There just isn’t enough liquidity in bitcoin.

254,"so that means that you should start moving around your bitcoin before selling them when the price gets higher and covers the cost of the fees... 
shake it... sell it..."
255,"Your response is subjective to a fault. Clearly anyone who has held BTC for even 3 short years has seen massive gains and this rise in value has been consistent, despite the volatility along the way. 
As for the $9b, you clearly have not been following this space very closely, and you most definitely don't have a handle on how incredibly early we are in the evolution of this new asset class. Anyway, spending $9b in a weekend is not a common problem in the world!"

And its related to the fact that there are not really that many people involved in crypto yet still, which is another thing a lot of us just dont realize while we are immersed in it.

258,Guess I’m not really seeing the point in a comparison when a specific question was asked. Thanks for clarifying though!
259,"> What 9 Billion 1 time transfer has ever happened in history??

lots of them?  Berkshire Hathaway does all cash deals of that size regularly.

here is one. appears to be about $20 billion in cash. https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20091103005847/en/Berkshire-Hathaway-Acquire-Burlington-Northern-Santa-Fe

$44 billion, $10 billion of it was debt. 40% of the rest was stock. so 60% of $34 billion was cash.

anyway this wasn't one transaction for $9 billion, it was 21 transactions."
260,AT&T bought direct TV for more than 9 billion. Although mostly a stock purchase. Still a movement of over 9 billion. Technically speaking.
261,"It has paper gains, you only realize those gains when you sell. Since bitcoin has paper thin liquidity $9b in btc isn’t worth anywhere close to $9b.

I would argue that btc is late into it’s lifecycle, look at the total supply as a ratio of it’s maximum supply, the game is already over."
262,The question was how much it would take to move FIAT. Not bitcoin. Use your eyes and brain.
263,"Ya was't over swift.... and not a ""Transfer"" so no.  Technically...  not even close to what we are talking about.  ""obviously ""....  You couldn't.  And what was the Cost?..... Ms"
264,"That's why I said you need to follow the space closer. I'm not going to rehash the arguments of technical developments, or talk about the massive strides in third party industry, or how many generations it logically has to take to switch users to something so very different from what they are used to. This information is readily available. But if you don't take the time or effort to learn, then you probably should not make comments about Bitcoin's lifecycle. Fair? 

I have only been following Bitcoin for a little more than half the time it's existed, but I've worked in the tech industry with networking and IT infrastructure, change management, digital marketing and more for a very long time. 

Bitcoin is just beginning. The problem with complacency is that too many people are too comfortable with the current status quo to be able to see what's coming down the pipe. And with Bitcoin, we have the additional issue of people only seeing the market price, and thinking price up=good, price down=bad. They have no comprehension of this new asset class, not based on any company's financial performance.

In the first 2 years of Bitcoin's existence, there was NO market, and NO market price. NO fiat value at all. Yet it somehow still managed to start catching on, long before there were whales, manipulation, or a crypto market. The total supply ratio is completely 100% irrelevant, because until the day the last coin is mined in 2140, the amount of Bitcoin added to the total supply continues to be reduced. We'll all be long dead by 2140 of course, but the price of a single BTC will likely be so high, that the small percentage of miner fees would be more than adequate incentive and payment.

Lastly, do not underestimate the effect of the next generation raised in a digital society taking over. Digital tokens, gaming currencies, etc., are a very natural course for these future investors. If anyone thinks they will continue to invest in gold dug up from the ground over a digital asset with 24/7 liquidity...they ought to think again."
265,"Ah, you’re right! I thought it was asking what fees would be in terms of fiat. Apologies for the misunderstanding!!"
266,"I've been in the space the majority of BTC's lifetime, so that's not an issue. 

>Bitcoin is just beginning.

It's not though, it ending. Again look at the circulating supply compared to it's maximum supply and tell me again that's it's still early. 

>The problem with complacency is that too many people are too comfortable with the current status quo to be able to see what's coming down the pipe.

Sure, but that doesn't mean bitcoin is going to be the new world reserve currency, it's just proof of concept, something to spark new ideas. It's 5-7 TPS can't service a small town, let alone the world. Halving rewards ensures that it would always be top heavy and never adopted by the masses, let along the uber wealthy that bitcoin needs to take off. It also ensures that the network gets weaker if the price doesn't continue to double every few years, again see the point about uber wealthy not buying in and over 85% already pumped out. 

Bitcoin was only ever proof of concept, it was never going to be a serious contender."
267,Way to own it! Now we can all be bitcoin buds :)
268,"Well done, would like to see the experiment continue in 2020."
269,Your experiment is one of the few things worth reading in this place. I implore you to continue and repeat the experiment in 2020 with another top 10. Keep up the good work!
270,Not sure why your including Tether as an investment - yes it’s a top 10 but as a stable coin (cough - bullshit) it’s never going to appreciate.
271,I reckon stick it out cuz. You’ll be remembered forever if you hold strong and pull this off.
272,O man ! I did that same experiment in 2017 ! Guess what ?! Same thing happened to me. Lol

274,"really interesting, thx for endeavoring on this project and documenting it.

now that i look over the graphs, i remember the latter part of 2017. thats when we peaked, i remember selling most of my btc at 18k, so buying in at 1.1.18 i can see why its down 85% since then. everyone was jumping on the train like crazy, fomo was high i guess. and like most things, interest dies down, and its just a fleeting memory.

all in all that was a very bad time to start the experiment lol, but hey, makes for a neat story."
275,"My suggestion: weighted investment. Buy 1 unit of 10th, 2 units of 9th, ... 10 units of 1st. Or something along those lines.

Could also be interesting to rather do a smaller monthly investment. Could have non-traditional strategies for how to rebalance..."
276,Do top 11-20 or top 10 shilled on here. Or bottom 10.
277,"How about doing the top 10 shilled coins by community vote?

They have to be coins you are not currently monitoring in this experiment already.

For example, I'd be very curious to see how VET would perform, especially at this point. VET is still down more than 93% from ATH and VET couldn't be more loved/hated in this sub."

284,"You should try top 20, there have been some gems that have seen better returns than coins in top 10"
285,"Cannot wait to see iota out of top 20. Iota had a seed round of 500k and then evaluated themselves at $1 billion, putting them in top10 and in public eyes. These guy are the stock market equivalent of wework and other startups.  Only that the crpto space is not mature enough to deal with such tactics.

Iota printed money out of thin air and convinced people to invest in them at their obsene evaluation. People who did invest got dumped on by the seed investers who made a killing


Edit: don't confuse seed round with ICO. In ICO's companies set a evaluation of say 30 million. And people give money to the company and get tokens in return.  Ex- EOS had an ICO where they received eth worth $4 billion. 

Iota didn't have an ICO. What they did instead was do a closed seed round.where only few people contributed $500k and then iota said that they were worth $1 billion(and people fell for it). Unlike eos which actually had received money from the public, iota didn't receive $1 billion.

Edit2: wework had received funding of $12 billion and evaluated themselves to $47 billion before reducing it, When people laughed at them. Iota however received funding of $500k,made a evaluation of $1 billion and crypto accepted it.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/28/wework-finance-workspace-unicorn-economic-model


Another example is of eth where it received 18 million in ico and didn't start with a billion dollar evaluation.

286,Keep buying for the 2020 and 2021 top 10's. Between now and Q4 2020 is the best time to buy.
287,By buying again in 2020 you will average the purchase price down and will be better positioned if/when a bull market returns.
288,"Wouldn't the S&P investment have yielded more than just the change in stock price? Wouldn't you need to count dividends?

Looks like something like %1.85? So maybe itd be 175 + 18.50 + 18.50? Roughly?"
289,Shoulda bought chainlink!

293,"i mean, couldn't you just check the price from 2 years ago?"
294,A repeat in 2020 could be very interesting indeed especially because of the halvening.
295,You should drop $1K into the 10 coins at the BOTTOM of the top 100.
296,"I hear for the year, ripple was down 40 percent. Is this true?"
297,"Let's think on a macro scale the m2 money supply is at 70 trillion dollars and growing with all the money printing every day. Crypto is around 200 billion dollars. Most of that wealth is with baby boomers. It is will get passed on to millennials and younglings. Even if some of it goes toward crypto, few of these projects will hit 500x."
298,So alts are poor investments? Color me surprised.
299,"Maybe instead of the top 10, you do the top 21-30. I bet those would change over a year"
300,keep going- if you do this every year it will become a legend once things bubble up again!

303,Are you going to do the same thing for 2020?
304,"May be, you can try the same thing in 2020 but on the Top 15 cryptocurrencies."
305,"Buy $50 in top 11-20 coins. Also, I'd throw you $5 to build up the fund if need be."
306,lovely shitcoin experiment 👍 turning $100 into three bucks one could say you met your NEMesis ;)
307,"Oh man, I was gonna say, you must’ve gotten rekt. -85% is actually better than I thought it would be...

Do the experiment every year, go top 20 if you have 2k. Buying low is the name of the game and you gotta get back your losses so lower your cost basis in these things and buy more now that it’s super cheap. In a decade, you’ll be glad you did"
308,One idea is to invest $10 in each of the top 500 cryptos on Jan 1st 2020. If one of those coins does a 500x in the next hype cycle. You should get back your initial $5000 investment or $10 into top 200.
309,A simple list with +/- x% would be easier to read.
310,"this is a ridiculous 'experiment'. you can just chart the info whenever you would like. so no, we do not need these posts in 2020, its literally pointless."
311,"You should put in $2000 down here and average down hard.

Exit in 2022-2023 when Bitcoin is at $250,000

Good luck"
312,Ouch. It sounds like a good time for us all to repeat your experiment. The only way is up!
313,2020 is theeee year you shud do it 🤞🏼
314,"I think it would be interested in you dollar cost averaged a small amount each month either the initial top 10, or the top 10 of each month, and tracked that to see how that compared."
315,Should give [AXIA](https://www.axiacoin.com/) coin a try in a future.
316,"So you've done the top ten 2 years in a row, for 2020 why not pick ten 'moonshot' low marketcap ones and see what happens?"
317,Why not by as many of the lowest cost cryptos as you can. Buying so low would have to generate a profit right?
318,Invest in MATIC. It's had a 125% increase in the last 30 days and still climbing. And the project is solid.
319,"Well, you can't see it continue if the holdings drop to less than $0.001.  The minimum transfer rate it $10 I think. Lol"
320,As would I as we’ve been in an extended bear market but feel sentiment will change 2020.
321,It would be better if he does a top 10 index. As in when a coin drops out of the top 10 he unloads it and buys the new entrant
322,no thanks. we know when its down. we know when its up....
323,haha i had the same exact thoughts. the fk is the point of a stable coin. the whole game is in the volatility
324,Pull what off?
325,"
As did the vast majority of buyers. 90% of people I know with crypto bought for the first time then."
326,Thats an interesting idea. $50 in each of the top 20 coins for next year
327,Or you're at risk of throwing even more money away.
328,In what timeframe?
329,"The market is still liquid though. People are trading it for something. Maybe just delusional but it's at least priced fairly off something. ""Fair"" is subjective though I suppose. 

Iota definetly seems like something that wouldnt attain a premium, is there any economic economic for it to accrue value? I regrettable have some as part of an index, but wont be surprised if it falls away, even if Iot is a big use case."
330,"On the topic of EoS's ICO as I understand it their ICO wallet was not locked/untouched during their ICO. It was therefore possible to recycle funds over and over into the ICO and blow out the market cap.

Do you know anything concrete about this?"
331,"Your comments are clearly suggesting that Iota is some sort of scam coin, which it clearly is not.  It has one of the largest teams in the entire space, and is one of the very few that has made very real deals with legit organizations and is seeing legit real-world adoption. 

Also, the Iota Foundation works very, very hard to avoid any involvement in price speculation.
 
The ""seed investors"" that you criticize bought their Iota with their own money, and they don't discuss how much they own or have sold.  They bought it at the same rate as everyone else.  Iota has been incredibly fair and transparent from the beginning.  
 
Your comments are just ludicrous."
332,"How the hell did they value (evaluate... what?) themselves? It’s the market who sets the price. Don’t be so sour.

Every ICO has printed money ‘out of thin air’. Even when you dislike Iota I don’t understand people upvoting this comment."
333,"What the hell have you been reading? IOTA never did any seed round. IOTA did an ICO back in 2015 when the community was way smaller so only like 1000 people bought in. They didn't evaluate anything, the market did. In fact, IOTA did the most open and honest ICO of all with no premine for the founders.

  
How does obvious lies like this go almost unchallenged in here???"
334,"Oh, yeah, midcaps, just like the Elizabeth Banks commercials that pop up in my crypto youtube."
335,"
If"
336,"So I’m a pretty noobish in the space but I thought after the hard fork that created BSV, that’s it’s just a separate token all together like BTC and BCH.  Is that not how it is?"
337,500x is a lot. It may not happen again.
338,"It's not impossible, but it's a damn large amount of work getting on all the exchanges needed to get some of those coins. Also, I wouldn't want to manage 500 wallets. I wouldn't want to leave them on an exchange either - the more random of a shitcoin it is, the shadier the exchange tends to be."
339,"I love how the good times continue to get pushed back by prospectors. 100k in 2021, I mean 2022, no wait 2023..."
340,Looks like you need a lesson in supply vs cost vs market cap
341,They may be low for a reason.
342,Huh? What do you mean?
343,Wouldn't that mean that he has no choice but to continue? Since he can't withdraw
344,that would be a PITA to maintain.
345,"Well let's just think about what could potentially happen here. This would be very dangerous, because when a coin falls out of the top 10 it is losing value, and when a coin is coming into the top 10 it is gaining value. Basically what would happen is you're going to repeatedly buy higher and sell lower on the coins going between 9 and 10. Knowing crypto currency and it's volatility, especially alt coins, this could happen a lot. I think it's safe to say that with that and trading fees it wouldn't be any better than holding the top 10 originally bought."
346,lots of taxable events..bleh.
347,Not losing his ass.
348,this
349,"Those fools. I cleverly bought in a whole two months before then, so I have *twice* as many tokens I held all the way down."
350,That's because they were buying when it was in the news. I'll bet they didn't touch in December 2018.
351,Probably the only useful strat is to just buy btc and exchange it if/when there is bull run. Alts usually lag behind btc in a bull run by a bit.
352,exactly!!!!!! people do not seem to have a memory longer then a moment....
353,"Don't even ask this man questions, everything he said is a lie. IOTA did an ICO, just like Ethereum did, but they did so in 2015 when a lot less people were around and raising millions only happened if you splurged on marketing like Ethereum did. IOTA Is the most honest project in the entire game, what other project did no premine or bribing of exchanges to list? I'll wait, there's been none."
354,"Nope. Look at the trading volume for iota, since it's debut in top10. It has the lowest volume in top10/20"
355,"Its possible that eos actually didn't receive $4 billion worth of eth for their ICO, it could be that they recycled it to increase their evaluation.


 However eos is far better when compared to iota in this matter. Iota received only $500k BTC in 2014 yet evaluated themselves 2000x times what they received"
356,"I am raising question about iota's evaluation. I am questioning how they evaluated themselves at 2000x the amount they raised.

I am not commenting on anything else on their team or how they market themselves"
357,"Ico- intial ""crowd"" offering. 

Iota didn't have one. Instead it had a seed round where only few friends and family of devs could contribute to.

Can you show me where iota conducted an ico ?"
358,Wsb has legends that lose money. So legend status regardless?
359,It was a split of the community and caused a big price dump but everyone that held BCH got the same amount of BSV..   It's similar to BTC/BCH but the impact of that isn't so clear.  I wouldn't have a problem if the same math applied in such comparisons though.
360,"They are separate coins. But if you held BCH at the time of the split, you also have BSV.  Thus, BCH coins purchased in Jan 2018 resulted in more value to the user than just what is stated by the BCH ticker price."
361,It definitely won't happen again
362,"There is pretty no doubt that a handful of platforms are going to go up in value astronomically.  Most won't, but a few are guaranteed too."
363,"500x will happen again countless times. Think about startups. Millions are started daily, a few of them every day end up doing 500x. It's almost impossible to find them though because millions are started daily.

Eventually crypto will get to mass adoption levels, and thousands of startups will be launched daily."
364,I actually heard 2024
365,"No that’s just your bias. Everyone has a range between 2021 to 2023. 🥰

No-body with half a clue is expecting $100k to be the ultimate parabola top in the next run (followed by an 85% retracement). 

Just because you’re Bearish and a coward doesn’t mean real investors are. I am more Bullish with every advancement every week and I love these cheap prices as I accumulate a lot more Bitcoins every month. 

Here’s a word from multi-millionaire Hodlers 💦💦

- Tim Draper bought 19000 BTC at $400 and he’s hodling until $250,000 by 2022-2023. He correctly predicted $10,000 BTC when it was only a few hundred dollars and he called it 3 years earlier.

- Trace Mayer, same thing

- DaVinciJ15 owns more than 3000 BTC and purchased at $32, he said the same thing

- Max Keiser bought heaps of Bitcoin at $1 to $5 and he is Hodling until $100,000 and clearly said “There is nothing unique about the number 100k, I only said it back in 2012 to my viewers because it’s a round arbitrary number target”

Arthur Hayes, same thing

Five people who are deep in the industry and worth between $20 million to $1 billion, who all have a track record of being correct many times before.

If you’re not on this train then good luck to you. I’ll be holding. Come back and quote this comment in December 2022. I already have cry babies quoting me from the $4k levels 😎"
366,"I admit complete ignorance to that subject and I appreciate the suggestion I will research that promptly.  Are there any other subject readers found really helpful when first learning the cryptogame?  

Also is there a really brief way of explaining why one wouldn't want to try to find the next big thing instead of taking top 10 when that's proven highly unsuccessful til this point?  Maybe putting 5 on top10 and spreading 5 among the lowest coins that have explosive potential would be a good expierment or teaching tool.  Ijs,  I'd watch that on YouTube"
367,"Plus, with fees, would that even be accurate in the end?  You would be losing part of your initial investment every time you shuffled."
368,"There is actually an index fund ETF.. but it was launched only around may 2018, so the early part of 2018 is not in the picture 

https://www.hbg.com/en-us/etf/hb10/info/"
369,"Thats true doing it for a small folio wont make sense. There is an ETF for that though, 

https://www.hbg.com/en-us/etf/hb10/info/"
370,lol calm down
371,"
Yup, been in this for nearly 7 years now, I told them not to buy during that crazy spike. I basically said that IF they were gonna buy, they should do it when everyone was declaring crypto dead or there are no interest. But nah."
372,"I was lucky(?) enough to get in for the first time around May of 2017.  I had enough balls to hodl through the huge dip/crash, but did not have the foresight to buy more during that time.

There's actually a post I made on a private forum I belong to in Jan/Feb of this year (2019) saying ""I think the bottom is finally in"".

Did I buy right then, though?  No.  Of course I didn't.  That would have made to much sense."
373,Bitcoin. You may stop waiting
374,"It's still liquid, I'm not saying its outstanding but most of the coins have almost no liquidity whatsoever, it's just random price walking with bots. Again, I'm not saying it's a great investment but theres people out there at least trading it and putting orders on the books. 

Being in the top 10 by volume and liquidity means something when the majority of the coins have 0 activity. The price is a result of active participants engaging with the market, rather than just statistical noise.

Liquidity is not the same as daily trading volume. Especially when you account for trans mine chines let exchanges."
375,"The irony is that this is because IOTA refuses to participate in washtrading which makes up more than 90% of all volume of crypto. They also refuse to pay exchanges to list IOTA. Again your ""concerns"" about IOTA are actually its strong points. Fair open ICO, no premine or special seed funding deals like other projects did, no exchange list bribing, no fake volume."
376,"IOTA didn't evaluate themselves, the market did. How is this difficult for you to understand? Are you paid by EOS or something to shit on competitors? How is EOS far better? IOTA arrived years before EOS, EOS came in at the peak of the hype and drained 4 billion into a project that has not achieved anything of notice. The team behind IOTA did more with 500K than a team with 4 Billion dollars. If anything IOTA should replace EOS in the top 20."
377,"Woo, EOS, the Richard Heart mentor!"
378,Then you clearly have no idea how the free market works. The Iota team did not decide what the token’s value was. It was the market.
379,Nobody is 'blindly accepting' Iota's 'evaluation'. The current supply is the total supply. Anyone can trade it on the biggest exchange in the space. It's extremely dishonest to pretend otherwise.
380,BULLSHIT. IOTA did an ICO back in 2015
381,"I always thought it stood for coin, still many coins have sold a part to investors first. Iota didn’t cause there weren’t any around at that time.

Their sell of was an ICO like any other in 2015.

Here’s the link for the down voters: public forum post from 2015 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1262688.0

Who’s the one whose lying."
382,They’re basically shards.
383,It's a different coin.
384,Nothing is guaranteed.
385,Cryptocurrency is one type of startup. Not every idea has a hit that delivers value.
386,"The only thing that's proven to be unsuccessful is buying the peak.

If this experiment started in 2013 there would be massive returns by this point.

Anyway, a coin's market cap is just supply × price.

Market cap is the indicator that tells what the whole coin is worth. That's why XRP can be under $1 and still be #3 on total market cap. There's literally over 43 BILLION coins. Compare that to Bitcoin's current 18 million, you can see why the price is different on the scale of thousands of dollars.



As an example to show how market cap changes, imagine I create a coin called Xcel coin. 

There's only 10 in existence. I sell them for $1 a piece. That means my market cap is $10

If the going rate for Xcel coin becomes $1.20, that's a 20% increase, and suddenly market cap is $12. 

If they become worth $100,000 each, then market cap is $1mil.  Etc."
387,"But crypto changes too fast for any of these funds to keep up, they're just snapshots of the starting point.  This one has ZEC and ETC.  

They all seem to be different collections, for example this one:

 [https://digitalassetindexfund.com/](https://digitalassetindexfund.com/) 

Whoa, just added XTZ!  ZEC is out. 

This one is a little different, adding ""Not in the dictionary""

 [https://www.amun.com/product/keys](https://www.amun.com/product/keys) 

Based on the price and the single asset funds they have, I'm guessing XTZ again, replacing ETC in this case. 

I had to refer to my posts of 21 days ago to spot the changes."
388,no u
389,That sounds now I’d the buy moment
390,Yeah. I remember January 2015. It's times like that you should buy. Although it's easy to say.
391,"> Did I buy right then, though? No. Of course I didn't. That would have made to much sense.

Yeah. It's easier said than done. Buy when there's blood on the streets but you don't know when it will stop dropping."
392,You mean Satoshi who premined 1 million bitcoins?:) ok
393,"https://www.bti.live/tracking/

Even iota's low volume is fake"
394,https://www.bti.live/tracking/
395,"They definitely did evaluated themselves. Their was no price discovery, just started with a 2000x the seed round price"
396,"If it did an ico then how many people participated in it?

There are no information in detail about this. What's stopping them from releasing the information about how many people participated and how much tokens they received each"
397,You lie again. Their was no ico. Look at my original comment to know the difference between ico and a seed round
398,"True but not helpful in this case. If you bought BCH in January 2018, and cashed everything out today, you also have some BSV to cash out. (And you should, lol)"
399,"> They are separate coins.

You are such a difficult person to talk to.  It’s like you didn’t even read what I wrote but felt like correcting me anyway."
400,"Regardless of what you think about Bitcoin long-term, there is no possible way that it will be the only blockchain platform that finds a large measure of success.  Blockchain will be used in smart contracts, logistics, IoT, and the list goes on.  Bitcoin is not built for those applications.
 
This means that there is no doubt that other platforms will succeed too, and given the current market, there can be no doubt that the ""winners"" will be massively more valuable than they are now.
 
It is like we are sitting in 1996 and someone says that Yahoo is going to be the only mass-adopted website because at the time it was #1 by a wide margin.  Anyone with half a brain knew that others were guaranteed to become huge as well, and there were."
401,"Oh, missed that dollop of Huobi Token in that Huobi index."
402,No u
403,"What's %WT, percent wash traded? It's ranked %WT less than BTC, ETH, and XRP which are the most liquid u/ still has IOTA still has over $1 million in  24hr trusted volume using Messari's metrics. That's not very much but certainly has some activity, which means the floor its at right now still acts as a somewhat valid price support. Order books have depth, and it provides liquidity

Another interesting fact is that all of the tokens that will every be produced are effectively fully distributed, with  93.38% of all outstanding supply held by investors, not founders. There is no real inflation, and is fully distributed, with no hidden inflation that would occur from tokens unlocking (like XRP/XLM, which have significant hidden inflation concerns). Check out their distribution [https://messari.io/asset/iota/profile](https://messari.io/asset/iota/profile) 

All that said, I still don't know what would raise its utility floor from what it is today. Coins like BTC have properties that make people obviously want to hoard it, which pulls from circulating supply available to the market, and it has properties that lock them away like lightning and other 2nd layer protocols. Ethereum and other staking protocols do stuff like this too, and anything with a burn mechanism will help push that price up too. I don't know if users of iota in the IOT network will be forced to hold it, or how the market will end up pricing it. Its hard to say how it will produce any monetary premium other that the fact that the next speculative bubble will push it up, because its clearly being chosen as a speculative asset by the market based on its liquidity, supply distribution and corresponding market cap. I'm not trying to shill, but these are just the objective facts. All I do is include a small percentage of it in my bags because it hits the mark on indices I follow, and if it falls out someday I will not be surprised or butthurt. I just choose passive index investing because its reasonably easy to do and should work well assuming the market stays efficient."
404,"How would that even be possible? Iotas was in the hands of thousands of people and then Bitfinex listed it, at the time the biggest exchange. How did anyone decide the price? The market did."
405,...That's the price discovery. They got listed and people started trading. You can't set a fake price point for something that is publicly traded and expect the price to stay at the fake point.
406,"It's all public information on Bitcointalk which was the main website for all things crypto since Satoshi made it until around 2016-2017 when the mainstream caught on. You can check for yourself through the Bitcoin recipient address. All of this is very well known, what the hell? I don't remember the exact number, there were 100s, then 1000s entered in 2016, 10 of 1000s in 2017 and then when it was listed it had the valuation the market gave it. Keep in mind that IOTA is one of maybe only 5 serious crypto projects, so it's really no surprise. I would argue that until IOTA is in top 5, the top 20 list is just a random mix of exchange manipulation and marketing, not reflecting anything real in terms of either code, research, executive ability of the team, partnerships or adoption."
407,"You please stop lying. Iota had a public crowd sale on the bitcoin forum in 2015.
Maybe you are confused with the Jinn token sold in 2014 I don’t known but stop stating I’m lying.


https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1262688.0

The first response in the topic actually calls it an ICO and that most ICO are scams... lol

Please do your research"
408,I cashed out the bcash early 2018. Thank god.
409,So you are contradicting yourself. You can't say BCH is intrinsically worth more than it seems because you can gather airdrops.
410,"You can't predict things like that though. For all we know crypto will trend downwards until it hits 0. Not likely, but possible.

In 5-10 years some random guy may come up will a better solution to currency and make crypto and generic currency irrelevant, who knows, you can't predict things like that. 

Just because crypto got off its feet doesn't mean it will be forever."
411,One i
412,The fact that you aren't saying the amount of people who contributed during the seed round is enough reason to see that there were only few who did.
413,"And how much worth of BTC did they receive ? It's one thing creating a page on forum and another to actually ask the public. 

Even assuming that this was an ""ico"" . How did $500k of BTC in 2014 become $1 billion of iota in 2017?"
414,OP is tracking his net worth after investing in coins two years ago.  That investment in BCH in early 2017 is now worth more than the individual value of the BCH tokens alone.
415,"Some random guy may come up with something better, sure, but it will be some other version of DLT architecture, in which case that one will take off. DLT is here to stay. Assuming otherwise is absurd.
 
That goes back to the fact that some platform is going to go up in value astronomically. Bitcoin may or may not stay on top, but others will also become big."
416,"What? Do your own research. I said it's several hundred people, I don't keep count of how many people were around in 2015 and putting money into IOTA. What does that have to do with anything? Your entire post is one long crazy lie you made up on the spot and you refuse to correct it"
417,"Wait what? How did they do that themselves? They bought bitcoin for exorbitant prices? Didn’t other ICO’s go up enormously at the same time. Wasn’t the market just retarded at that time. ICO’s a bit later were valued 10 times that in their initial sale...

Like how did they manipulate the market? Did they spoof their own bitcoin address, faked all the reply’s on the bitcoin forum. What the hell are you talking about and why?

You clearly weren’t around in 2015 but the bitcoin forum was the public portal of cryptocurrency at the time. This is where you made ICO’s public."
418,"You just said that their is a receipt addresses and yet are making comments to divert the matter. 

We will talk when you give the amount of fund raised and no of people who contributed to it. Since BTC is public chain you can find it easily."
419,"Take the example of Cardano which also conducted an ico at the time. It had a high evaluation at the start because people who invested in 2015 did in eth and when it debuted in 2017, eth had a high value.

But it is not the same for iota. Iota raised $500k of BTC in 2014. Accordingly it should have started with a market cap of 10-20x depending on when the seed round was closed. But it's starting MC was 2000x the amount it raised."

422,Obligatory: Fuck Polo
423,"Brave of you, assuming they had a soul to begin with"
424,This exchange is a joke. It's a shame I used it once
425,Polo is garbage and has been since the trollbox disappeared. Tron is a complete scam and the entire mess should be avoided and fucked over at every opportunity.
426,This is just abysmal...
427,Private companies do as private companies do. They have every right to list/delist whoever they want. On whichever ground they choose.
428,"DigiByte is garbage, so I really don't care."
429,Justin prolly bought Poloniex
430,After having bitcoins taken away from me to cover some margin trading mess they created I would never ever keep any funds in that exchange. They promised a series of repayments but we have heard nothing for half a year now. All they do is to move their business to shady offshore territories to avoid being sued. 1800 BTC are missing!!!
431,So now you can only get Digibyte on 22 exchanges instead of 23? Dang. 🤷‍♂️
432,"Does anyone know why digibyte is not more popular? It's super fast, has multiple algorithms and seems to just work all of the time. Why hasn't it caught on? It feels so underpriced"
433,"To be fair, the guy was acting like a twat. Could have been much more civil about his criticisms and would have gotten away with that.

And it's not like DGB's trading volumes were worth while. Very little impressive updates either. He should be focussing more on development rather than making more enemies on Twitter."
434,How is this controversial?
435,"FFS people CEX are private companies who seek for profits... WAKE UP this is the real world and no crypto is going to change that. Don't expect the companies providing service doing it for free.  DGB had not enough volume so why would POLONIEX still provides a service that barely brings in turnover or at a cost?

&#x200B;

People winning but still 99% of us are here first for profit then comes other hopes."
436,fuck poloniex
437,"Let's not forget Circle, who knew what they were doing in selling off Polo to a non-credible buyer without consideration of the projects or users."
438, wen polo?
439,I'm on it
440,Fuck Tron
441,"Polo was my first exchange so it will always have  a special place in my crypto heart.

The Polo of today is a dying dino and has been going downhill nonstop since the troll box was removed. Now with Justin it will die soon, like TRX."
442,"Yeah, well criticizing their shady dealings also helps inform everyone’s choice of an exchange based on more complete data. I’m definitely avoiding them from now on."
443,"And users can do as users wish, if an exchange sells to a shady/scammy project and then delists any projects that go against that crypto, then i won't use it. I'm not going to say they have some sort of legal obligation to not delist coins, but i don't have legal obligation to keep using them."
444,So is Tron
445,Can you explain why you think that? I've never had any issues using it. It's very fast.
446,"Aah, DigiByte. Bought it once long long time ago on a news/conference attendence hype, got burned. Atleast DGB thought me to DYOR after that. So kudos to DGB for being a bad example and a good lesson. Also, couldn't be arsed about a delisting either :)"
447,You could have just scrolled past this thread then?
448,"You are wrong, DGB is no gargabe. It has technology that other projects have adopted, like MultiShield and Realtime Difficulty Adjustment. Also, there are companies building with DigiByte technology, DigiAssets and Digi-ID."
449,"Actually, I wouldn't be surprised - on Tronscan they now refer to the DEX as ""Polonidex"""
450,"Gonna say, people in crypto are so dramatic, poloniex sells its soul and credibility, lol.

These are private exchanges and can do whatever the hell they want. The stuff I was reading on twitter made it sound like poloniex  employees went around killing and eating children.

This is how free markets work. Dont like it, and there are literally dozens of other choices, even for dgb."
451,"I personally feel Digibyte lacks innovation. For starters, is a bitcoin fork. They haven't innovated anything meaningful so far from a development perspective. Also, the hashrate is not impressive. On a personal note, the Twitter shillers are pathetic, they are EVERYWHERE.

But I gotta give it to the founder. He has stand up against the mafia of Justin and CZ. Kudos for that. Dgb is better than tron 1000 times."
452,"Circle are just bidnessmen... they bought polo for a $bag, someone offered more and they sold it..

But the guy behind polo jeremy aliedaire is still calling the shots and he made the call to delist dgb"
453,"Mine too, it hurts to see them slowly die."
454,"Also true, that is your right as a consumer. And neither is to blame, and either is right; welcome to free markets. :)"
455,"Because Nano is vastly superior, so why would I choose DGB over it? Literally zero reason to. Same thing with Bitcoin and Litecoin, except at least Bitcoin and Litecoin have liquidity. DGB has nothing over Nano."
456,"Bought it when it and hundreds of other shitcoins were new and dumped it after it ran and made me some nice fiat gains.
 Held a few too long and gave profits  some back, but overall, I’ve done well in the crypto markets"
457,✨👍✨
458,Jeremy is no longer behind polo because they sold it. And ceos rarely meddle in small day to day things such as delisting a shitcoin
459,"Compare cryptocurrencies to torrents. No matter how much goverments tryed to erradicate them, they are still alive and will continue to be as long as they fill some niche of functionality."
460,"""You can't kill an idea"". Albigensianism seems to be dead enough."

463,Warren Buffet truly is a legend. It will be very hard to find anyone else with more wisdom than him.

466,Great to see established players like Microsoft collaborating with legit blockchain companies like Enjin that have been dutifully building useful tech that actively adds value compared to the way things are currently done.
467,Congrats! Any store that accepts crypto is a good thing. Good luck!
468,"after 10 years, btc adoption still hasn't moved past ""look at this quaint little store accepting bitcoin""."
469,Website looks amazing. May i ask what is she using for the website?
470,I'd wish she accepts a stablecoin instead. BTC can be crazy sometimes
471,That's awesome! Props for using BTCPay for processing payments. Did you set it up by yourself?
472,Bearish.
473,Galaxus accepts bitcoin and it's the biggest e-commerce in switzerland. What about that?
474,Wrong
475,"That's why I look forward to Facebook putting Libra in the hands of 2.5 billions potential customers, to finally see crypto reach mass market, and have users transition naturally to Bitcoin ultimately"

478,"BTW, you should add your mom's store on https://cryptoaccepted.app (shameless plug)"
479,"Thank you, yes I did. The website and BTCPay server are both self hosted on my own hardware!"
480,"wrong, they accept fiat.   
bitpay is the intermediary that converts bitcoin to fiat."
481,"Still, it is a win for the consumer since he can pay with bitcoin without converting to fiat. What the retailer does with the BTC or other cryptocurrencies is none of our business.

For example, I recently bought web hosting with nano and they used Coingate for processing funds. I'm pretty sure they must have converted to fiat as web hosting space is heavily competitive (and thus, every single dollar counts). But paying using cryptocurrency is a huge convenience for me. I am able to pay without entering my credit card number online. **This is huge.**"
482,"when was the last time you bought something with btc?   
other shitcoins don't count btw"
483,"why the fuck would any libra user transition to bitcoin? libra is more stable and cheaper to use then bitcoin, and people don't care about centralization."
484,May I ask which theme. Looks pretty solid.
485,Wonderful. No middle man - that's the main point of Bitcoin.
486,"Why don't other crypto currencies count? You think there's only room for one, that happens to be slow and not scalable? Talk about moving the goal posts."
487,They don't care probably about any of your points. The only reason would be convenience.
488,It's the standard WordPress Storefront theme. I've just changed the colouring around a bit!

491,"From the official source:  


***Dear global Waltonchain supporters,***

*On December 5, 2019, Mr. Do Sang Hyuk will become the new CEO of Waltonchain!*

*Mr. Do Sang Hyuk, the new CEO of Waltonchain, comes from South Korea. He is the Vice-Chairman of China-Korea Cultural Exchange Development Committee, former Director of* [*ET News*](http://www.etnews.com/) *and former Chairman of China-Korea Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Committee for Seongnam, South Korea.*

*As one of the initiators of Waltonchain, Mr. Do Sang Hyuk has been responsible for the promotion, technology application and commercialization of Waltonchain in South Korea. He was commissioned by Walton Chain Foundation to establish the non-profit foundation Korea Blockchain Institute to cultivate blockchain industry talents and technology developers. In the past two years, the Institute has trained more than 200 blockchain professionals in line with the Korean Governments requirements.*

*Mr. Do Sang Hyuk has been making a great contribution to the development of Waltonchain over the past years. We believe that, as an ecosystem and a team, Waltonchain will have an excellent future under the leadership of Mr. Do Sang Hyuk.*

*Mr. Mo Bing, the former CEO of Waltonchain, will continue to contribute to and provide services for the Waltonchain ecosystem in the same capacity as before but in the role of Chief Expert of Waltonchain, focusing on the blockchain industry development, namely enterprise incubation and empowerment.*

*We hereby thank the global Waltonchain supporters for continuous support and trust!*

494,"Yes, there were some recently actually."
495,"Just give them your nano address, no more. If they send you nano you're set. They don't need any other additional information, just create a Nano wallet and receive your prize. If they ask you for some additional info, mostly sure is. Scam."
496,"Holey dooley looks legit! You need to setup a nano wallet, I recommend you download the natrium wallet on your phone. From there you will have an address for the reddit tip bot to send the nano to. From there I recommend you keep hold of it, but if you prefer to spend it there are places that accept it."
497,"r/nanocurrency for more info about Nano. 

You'd be better posting there if you need help with the tip bot etc."
498,[deleted]
499,"""Free something "" is always a scam"
500,"Its a scam. Its called the ""free nano"" scam. 

They'll give you ""free nano"", you'd end up getting interested(and buying some), then it will crash 98% putting your future at risk. 

Stay away."
501,Thanks!
502,"There is a message you send to the tip bot to make it pay, I don't remember the instructions but look in your reddit inbox."
503,Thanks!
504,Thanks
505,It looks legit to me. Did you even follow OP's link? They're using the Nano tip bot.
506,"Not sure I understand. According to what you write, I would think the following would happen. OP gets USD 100 in nano, it crashes 98% and OP ends up with USD 2. If OP provides nothing else than his NANO address I don't see where the scam would be. (Though, as a rule of thumb, something like money for nothing always smells of scam to me from the get-go)."
507,Yea I found it thanks!
508,"""getting interested"" meant he buys some too. That's what results in financial loss.

Even without that, its a waste of time, since this $100 would likely soon be worth much less."
509,It's a free bag on a fairly relevant crypto. Even if you don't like nano there's 0 reason not to claim a free $100 lmao. You make it sound like it's some $20 volume etherdelta trash.
510,I liked you better when you were shitting on xrp. At least it makes sense🤨
511,Now post from your other username(s) to validate your comment and make yourself feel better
512,"It was going for some **hyperbole** humor here. Didn't expect people to take it seriously. 

Ofc $100 in any tradable currency is $100. With some effort he can sell it and get $98 or so, less exchange fees. 

So my comment makes no sense if you take it seriously. 

Anyway I almost never say anything negative of nano. Never looked into it much. Its an interesting project, better than ltc/bsv which are outright copies of btc in top ten."

514,So happy I got out of this token without losing everything.
515,"When a CEO leaves their position its generally for one of a few reasons if they are also the founder. (Speaking from experience)

1. They have lost heart in their mission and are giving up.

2. They lack the necessary leadership qualities to drive the business to where it needs to be.

3. The company is performing poorly when the potential of the business is actually high.

I don't know their former CEO obviously, but I hope for holders of WTC that it turns out to be a positive move."
516,"Poor Walties, getting rekt over and over, and over, and over...."
517,"Hello there, I sold my Waltons 2 years ago (at 6$ before the pump to 40$), was a bit salty about it. But now with enough time I can objectively speak my mind.

Hardware related projects are often missunderstood here by the plebs. The difference between a software project and a hw one, is that a software driven project requires a programmer and computer, and generally if a solution exists, it can be very fast to developp.

With hardware, it's a lot more complexe than this: you have several fields of engineering involved, including System engineering, Hw engineering, Layout engineering, even software engineering to do embedded systems programming, and on top of that a blockchain engineer. Also, to construct your product, you need to do a lot of sub contracting to other companies, because if you want to construct just 1 PCB, you need a whole industry of techniques.

Most people in the space are either clueless about tech investors and are just here for the pumps, or blockchain veterans that have spent so much time behind a computer, hacking and doing cryptography, that they have absolute no idea how a hardware is produced.


That being said, I know nothing about Walton anymore and can't judge, but can understand the delays and the problems.

I am very excited about any hardware solution"
518,cant believe it 🚀
519,Oh boy
520,"Frankly I would be very worried if I was in WTC right now. Let's just set aside the 100+ red flags that this project has for a second and focus on this area in particular.

First, they lose Monitor Chan, their original COO (completely left the project). He exited fairly early after realizing how stained Walton's reputation is. He played a pretty significant role in the initial pump and dump in September 2017 during the slack days. 

Moving on, July 2019, Mo Bing, CEO, posts a ridiculous hype tweet promising the ""greatest news ever for WTC holders"". I repeat again, the ""greatest news ever"". During this time, the price pumped as expected. Sources point to Mo Bing dumping around the $3 peak. Naturally, what did the news end up being? A pump and dump scheme where the team would airdrop tokens if certain price targets are met by January 2020. 

Just think about that for a minute though. The CEO claims greatest news ever, and it's a price pump scheme. Just take a step back and really analyze that for a minute then get back to me. I don't blame him for stepping down and mitigating his risk. This is not the kind of man I would want as a CEO."
521,"This is one of the biggest shitcoin scams going. That people still think that this is a viable project shows what a state the crypto world is in. Fake competitions, fake partnerships, fake offices, fake miners (that magically sell out and nobody has bought) and to cap it all off, a fake token swap, and a product that has been proved completely unviable repeatedly. RFID on blockchain is laughable to anybody that has been near a supply chain. Yet it soldiers on, now being passed to the next bunch of scammers. Anybody holding this junk, this is what happens when you think a YouTube video is DD."
522,"So, that likely explains that large fat-finger dump to 0.0000629 on Binance..... an insider dump.

&#x200B;

This may be some dark times ahead for Walties, all the best!

I'm going to cast some more FUD here, as I do have a tiny Walty bag, and I want to know what the new policy and direction of Waltonchain is going forward. This is more important now."
523,is it that hard to stay away from blockchains with a CEO?
524,When another Twitter raffle?
525,"Mr. Mo Bing, the former CEO of Waltonchain, will continue to contribute to and provide services for the Waltonchain ecosystem in the same capacity as before but in the role of Chief Expert of Waltonchain,

Mr. Mo holds several positions at once. This move is to better concentrate efforts. 

The new ceo is also a co founder of waltonchain."
526,"well  Mr. Do Sang Hyuk, the new CEO, is a co-founder of WTC and managing the korean part, so not somebody new. Waltonchain is probably adapting for chinese regulations.

*Mr. Mo Bing, the former CEO of Waltonchain, will continue to contribute to and provide services for the Waltonchain ecosystem in the same capacity as before but in the role of Chief Expert of Waltonchain, focusing on the blockchain industry development, namely enterprise incubation and empowerment.* 

In my oppinion nothing to be dramatic about"
527,"Bullish!.....?

The hardware phase is over! Time to go for business adoption, especially in Korea!!!

I'm not sure if I'm being sarcastic, as may be true also... we'll have to see how Yayo spins it...

Hence the Throwaway, as he'll call me a Fudder."
528,"I have to admit it doesn't appear the source knows anything about cryptocurrency, china, or blockchain. They fail to mention that Mo Bing is a representative of the China Blockchain Standards and that the new CEO is in fact an original founder of Waltonchain and is one of the founders of the Korea Blockchain Institute. 

Obviously its a reputable news outlet...

Lying about waltonchains performance but only refers to price and nothing else."
530,Not to mention their COO and project leader left over the summer and their was little announcement. He is now starting his own project
531,Or they will start another scam.

533,"find it hard to believe someone decides they don't want to scam anymore, and it's clearly not number 3....so 2 it is!"
534,Why are people trying to spin this as something bad? CEOs changes often in companies and there is nothing weird about this. It seems like 99% of all FUD here didn't even bother to read the whole explanation. Mo Bing is still there and will be just as involved.
535,"As someone who bought Walton in 2017 sold in early 2018 and had made several negative Walton posts, I have to say alot of your comment is baseless. The office fud is ridiculous and to my knowledge the miners aren't fake(granted I have issues with them). I believe Walton is a hyper incompetent company that borders on fraudulent. However, when you make these low effort comments you are only playing into their hands."
536,"The token swap is ongoing. There are a few exchanges that have the new chain available. 


Fake competitions --->  wrong

fake partnerships --- >  wrong

fake offices --- > wrong again, you're not doing very well here

fake miners (that magically sell out and nobody has bought)-> wrong

and to cap it all off, a fake token swap  --- > wrong again. 

This is one of maybe, maybe 10 out of thousands of cryptocurrencies that are combining hardware and software in a block chain project. Sorry but this takes time. If you have ever done programming in embedded systems and understand the enormous amount of work to get this off the ground, well, clearly you don't because you wouldn't be here whining about a project you have no interest in other than to cry bloody murder, clearly reflecting your ignorance on this topic.

I get it, everyone is mad about the price. Let's face it though -- how are ETH, Cardano, NEO and on and on doing price wise? They are all down %90 or so, hardly leaving Walton unique as far as price suppression. The dipshit clowns who have nothing better to do than attack legitimate projects just because they don't have it in their portfolio is grotesque. These people are such losers it's actually funny. I sure as hell laughed about it all -- by the way I have only *ever* put about $300 into this project so clearly I was reasonable about only investing what I can afford to lose. I intend to hold for the next ten years. If you are saying Walton will never recover to it's previous price, you are literally saying you believe the *market cap of the entire crypto space* will never reach anywhere near it's all time high."
537,"Can't believe they made this fake miner that nobody bought or reviewed. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3mmwlTd0w4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3mmwlTd0w4)"
538,Wow. Not one word of truth. Yet in your own mind you seem to know it all. Well done. Son of cream.
539,"Let's be honest, most here *want* a CEO and large company to pump their bags. They couldn't care less about blockchain, it's all about partnerships now."
540,"Notice how the only, and I mean literally the only people in this thread talking shit and blowing this out of proportion are VET holders. Man the CCP must be treating them great."
541,I cannot believe there are still people believing this WaltonChain bullshit...
542,[deleted]
543,So it’s a failure and he is looking for his next gig because the scamming days are over ?
544,"Perhaps you should read my comment again. I said I didn't ""know"" him... rather than what you took it to mean... knowing his name.

Edit - the fact I'm being downvoted on this comment for pointing out the obvious is weird as it gets. Perhaps you need to get outside."
545,Just restart with some other coin.
546,It is odd when a top 4 cryptocurrency loses its ceo and ceo in lesser than a year
547,"First they lost their COO (completely left the project), and now Mo Bing is stepping down? They haven't even carried out hardly anything yet and they're already having 2 significant changes in management? It's way too early in the game for this to be happening. Why else would Mo Bing write up the hype tweet though and try to pump the price in July? I'm sure he's happy now that his risk is more limited."
548,"I didn’t post anything, but ok. Great input, thanks."
549,"I never mentioned the price, I was being kind, yet somehow you triggered yourself. Hold for the next ten years, you couldn’t make this shit up! Great way to spend $300, it’s the other people who are losers right? It is indeed funny 😂"
550,"A lot of misinformation is spread about walton regarding the offices, giveaway etc. But there are a lot of legit concerns too. Fake partnerships wrong? Tell me more about Fuyao, Septwolves, Alibaba cloud, and China Mobile to start with. I can dig a lot of these old announcements out that amounted to nothing. When was the last time you heard anything about these? 2017, maybe early 2018? Medium articles written by Walton don't count."
551,its over dude.
552,Did you not read my last sentence?
553,Calm down incel
554,This is simply not true. There are plenty of non-VET posters criticizing Walton. Check my post history to see what I think about VET.
555,I can't believe that there are still people thinking if they knock legit crypto projects online that somehow the projects *they themselves* invested in will be worth more money.
556,You need to do at least a bit of research mate.
557,Uh yea you did...
558,"> I was being kind

Actually you were not.

>biggest shitcoin scams going

Nice mastery of the English language there."
559,"Fair enough, although what do you suppose the Chinese Communist Party being rabidly anti-decentralized crypto has to do with this? Everything. They are actively opposed to any project that hasn't greased their wheels. I will tell you more about these partnerships: The Communist Gov't does *not* approve. That is why it has been ignored."
560,"Didn’t I just disprove your entire post? You claim everything is fake - I show you a real miner. You’re making things up and I’m calling you out on it.

Edit: it’s amazing how you guys get away with brigading btw."
561,Lol. Had to look that one up. I guess it takes one to know one. Theres some desperate butthurt keyboard warrior princesses getting about nowadays. Again. Good call. You deserve an up vote.
562,+1
563,Since I haven’t invested in a competitor I couldn’t care less. But it’s still fun to see you guys being so blinded that you are still following their bullshit even if everything screams scam!
564,[deleted]
565,Nice investment
566,This is the most baffling comment I've read today on any platform in any language.
567,"You posted a YouTube video, do you think that’s the same as showing me a real miner???"
568,"Yes, that’s brilliant research! You should become a detective with those telegram reading skills! Look out MI5, we have the next code breaker right here!"
569,"Ok, come round this afternoon I’ll show you. 

The guy in the video is one of the most respected miners in the space. Maybe he’s using Tony Stark’s holographic technology, or maybe JUST MAYBE the device is real. 

I seriously can’t believe people like this are allowed to communicate on this platform."
570,"Fuck knows what you wouldn’t and would believe.

One of the most respected miners in this space. This shit is gold. Investing on the back of YouTube videos, you got what you deserved 😂"
571,"So now that I've proven the miner is REAL, you're pretending that people invested because of a video? What do you guys get paid to come up with this??? hahahaha"
572,So now it’s real because you put it capitals?
573,I bet you think electricity is magic.

603,"The dream is unironically dead.

The HOLO team have embarrassed themselves in various ways, including but not limited to not having a network, and selling people hardware and not delivering it.

Unfortunately this was probably their best move.

If they would have shipped the (now obsolete) warehouse PCs they sold people, it would be painfully obvious that they are just perpetuating a scam.

Now they have no choice. It has been too long. They have to make a move because people are running out of patience.

This shines a light on the most glaring issues: there is no working software, no Holofuel, and Holoports are about to be declared paperweights in videos and reviews on youtube and all over the internet.

So not delivering looks bad, but it gave them the opportunity to squeeze out this last big PnD before they are caught red handed selling useless legacy hardware with no real software platform to speak of.

At this point there is zero hope for this zombie project and the slow exit scam is underway.

I guess that's what happens when you steal your product strategy from a parody show about Silicon Valley.

To sum it up, if the ports ship it's going to zero. If the ports don't ship it's going to zero.

This latest effort is just a poorly paid shill group hired by the team and the few ramaining bagholders that know they are stuck with this garbage.

The team is exit scamming on you right now. There is no software and the hardware they sold and never delivered is outdated now.

Dump now or learn the hard way how fast dying scam coins under 10sats can crash to zero."

Low tier strawman right there.

839,"I think it would be easier for China to just take control of mining pools and the hardware that already exist in China's BTC farms than it would be for them to obtain enough new hardware. A few well delivered pieces of espionage, some substantial bribes and you could take out other large non Chinese farms from the network. Add to that stopping the export of miners from China for a few months and stock piling it. I don't think it would be that hard at all for China to obtain 51% of the hash rate if they wanted to.

I believe this is what David is alluding to, not China obtaining enough new fancy miners to out pace the rest of the ecosystem on the down low.

But if china wanted to kill bitcoin all they would need to do is to spend a few $$ sending BTC transactions back and forth forcing up the fees and delivery time on chain. It's possible that they can use their own farms to process and collect the huge fees so they are not actually losing that much right? over night the cost and speed of a btc transaction goes through the roof, they don't loose much on fees but anyone else that wants to transact has to pay through the roof or they cant transact.  Effectively making the network unusable for 99% of its current users. (Knowing the crypto market speculation might send the coin to an ATH having the opposite effect of what was planned.)"

841,That is very true. All it takes is money to initiate a  51% attack on bitcoin.
842,If governments got together and spent 100 billion for example on equipment to take over the chain. The devs will very quickly come to a consensus (like the inflation bug) and fork the chain with another algorithmn. Rendering 100 billion dollars spent. Worthless.

There's no way a government would be able to do it in secret without leaks, and also there's no way a free government would actually allow wasting so much resources, time and effort to actually do this. Maybe the chinese or russian government would pull it off, but for what? It's completely futile. People will just fork it with a different PoW algo next month and then they gotta start making a new billion $ hardware farm... over and over. It makes no sense for a government or anyone to do this. It's completely futile. 51% attacks don't kill bitcoin or crypto, they just cripple it. It's unkillable, so why even bother when it takes so much resources to do it?"
847,"Hmm I think it's possible but unlikely because the miners would be blacklisted from the network and successfully defending attacks ends up adding value to bitcoin and anything they did manage to make they'd be selling for cheap compared to what they're investment was, the attack can't go on forever so when it stops the value returns."

850,Does anyone have a link to this patent?
851,"""All it takes is money""

Um, It also takes electricity, space, time, man power, and resources to create all the ASICs that they would need to gain the 51% attacking power...

And currently, there is not enough ASIC production to meet the demand they would need.

Just because you have billions of dollars, does not mean you have everything you need to attack the BTC network.

In all seriousness, all it takes for XRP to plunge is a shutdown of Ripple, no money required even! Here's the deal; Bitcoin will fork off and live on, as will XRP live on too. In both cases the chances of it happening in the first place is extremely low, the whole point of decentralization is *lowering* the amount as much as possible.

As many of the portions as possible are distributed for processing on the lowest level of the system.

Can also prohibit any account from transacting, by not including un-wanted transactions in the blocks they hash.

Regradless, once a 51% eventually happens on BTC, the damage will be done. Who will want to store wealth in a exploitable system?

We have already seen many PoW DLTs such as BTC been 51% attacked: Bitcoin Cash (which once had 60 Billion+ in Mcap, currently Rank 5), and others such as Ethereum Classic, Verge, Bitcoin Gold, and more recently Vertcoin (which supposefully had anti-asic mechanisms).

The problem with this security model is that attackers don't need to have **skin in the game,** that is, being invested in the actual Token. They just need to invest in Hardware, which can be used to compute whatever.

That is why I see NANO's ORV as much more secure. The only way to attack the network is to have more than 51% of the ACTUAL TOKENS delegated to your node. For that to happen, you either need to buy it, or get most of the community to trust you.

Not only its way harder to pull it off, the cost involved is much bigger than to attack a PoW chain. If you achieve 51%, you'll be hurting yourself the most - as you are the biggest investor in the network (either in Capital or Time). Unlike a PoW DLT, where you can attack a chain and switch your mining power to any other chain, sucking as much profit of it as you go (minting + fees), then shorting it 100x and 51% attacking it to secure your trade."

911,Let’s lid up on some NSA coins or China coin!
912,So BTC forks with a new hash algorithm so the attacker can't use the ASICs anymore. BTC loses all its security from existing ASICs and it's back to GPUs on the new algorithm. The attacker has GPUs ready and 51%s the fork immediately. What now? BTC would be dead.

916,"I suppose technically if the 51% attackers used all old nodes not upgraded to SegWit then they could move any BTC held in SegWit addresses to their own address. Because to prevent old nodes from being excluded from the network, as in the case of a hard fork, SegWit uses a clever trick that enables old nodes to see SegWit transactions by making them appear as ‘anyone-can-spend’. SegWit addresses have been spent by miners on BCH (because BCH forked before SegWit activated) to rescue coins accidentally sent to SegWit addresses on the BCH chain that were otherwise rendered unspendable."

If Ripple exploded today, the XRPL would continue on, yes its value would drop but nothing would stop the ledgers from closing and being processed.  You are equating a drop in price with the project stops working, which is false.

>Here's the deal; Bitcoin will fork off and live on

> In both cases the chances of it happening in the first place is extremely low,

XRP is immune to 51% attacks.  It would take infinity dollars to even do one (because you cant use money to buy hashrate as there is none for XRP)  so 1 is mathematically impossible. the other is highly improbable.

BTC has become more centralized over time, not less. XRP is the opposite. started very centralized and has grown to become much more decentralized than many of the top assets today.

in a POW system, yes. In XRP's system, no it isnt impossible as I said above, a 51% attack on XRPL isnt possible. it is designed to be immune to it.

The fork would be also cheaper to attack.

Wrong. Yes XRP is 51% ""proof"" but money can absolutely bribe their way into the ULR. Every project can buy control, you're ignorant to think otherwise. 

>If Ripple exploded today, the XRPL would continue on, yes its value would drop but nothing would stop the ledgers from closing and being processed.  You are equating a drop in price with the project stops working, which is false.

How did I say otherwise? The drop in price (and impling the NSA would short the market) is the whole point of his comment? Forking away *is* keeping Bitcoin working after such a thing happens. The whole fucking statement is ridiculous implying a 51% would break Bitcoin entirely. Markets would stop, roll backs will happen and the abusers would lose millions. How the hell do you think is logical that they can spend millions on hash *and* having that covered with ease? You really think that it is harder for the state to break XRP through Ripple, which wouldn't cost them a penny? 

>and who decides which algorithm to fork to, if you're leaving SHA 256 now every ASIC for it becomes useless, Who decides which is ""best"" going forward? The community has historically been awful at making these decisions, it would just lead to multiple forks. 

Ahhh I see now where you are going with this, the community can't decide so bitcoin dies? XD Let me remind you that XRPL forks/updates whatever are ""forced"" upon the community, don't update and your validator doesn't work anymore. You think a Ripple-less XRP can have a decisive nature in choosing their path? There are hundreds of algorithms, thinking this is the issue is downright foolish. 

>XRP is immune to 51% attacks.  It would take infinity dollars to even do one (because you cant use money to buy hashrate as there is none for XRP)  so 1 is mathematically impossible. the other is highly improbable. 

Again, my comment is about a attack by the state, one would cost 0, one would cost millions. You notice I'm making the same extreme as you? Also, stating a 51% is impossible is correct, but also semantics because that percentage is higher. You can in fact gain enough on the XRPL control albeit not 51%.

>BTC has become more centralized over time, not less. XRP is the opposite. started very centralized and has grown to become much more decentralized than many of the top assets today.

False, pools grew more decentralized over time. You can check yourself using the Herfindahl-Hirchman Index (HHI) which is used for checking market concentration. The days where pools actually controlled near 50% often were in 2014. XRP is not much of a celebration, it took YEARS to even be considered decentralized, we need lots of more years to check whether that trend continues. Considering many of the validators are Ripple partners as well it's hard to say whether that means no Ripple control.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed\_computing#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing#History)"
1015,">And this is way before Satoshi's whitepaper.

This has little, if anything, to do with Satoshi's whitepaper. Satoshi did **not** invent distributed computing or parallel processing; he invented the blockchain. The patent seems to be about distributed computing in general: i.e., breaking up a problem into smaller pieces across different machines in a cluster, and then reassembling the outputs into a final solution (in a ""split-apply-combine strategy""). Indeed, this has little to do with blockchain or, say, what nodes in Bitcoin or Ethereum do.

In Bitcoin or Ethereum, individual nodes do *not* each receive a little piece of a problem in order to solve one larger computation. Rather, they all perform the same computation redundantly. For example, every Ethereum node will execute the same smart contract code; the smart contract code is not broken down into smaller pieces across nodes, and the overall task is *not* split up among the nodes/computers to be processed.

The distributedness of blockchain is not what makes it interesting. Public key cryptography is not what makes blockchain interesting (we've had such cryptography for a long time), and Satoshi did not invent it. Hash functions and proof-of-work are not what make blockchain interesting (we've had them for awhile, too), and Satoshi did not invent them either.

What makes blockchain interesting is its solution to the consensus problem. The solution to this problem *allows a distributed system—and in the case of blockchain, a distributed database—to become a* **decentralized** *system*. All decentralized systems are distributed, but not all distributed systems are decentralized.

1039,"It would be alive in practice and only dead in value short term. There was a ban on gold and look how that turned out. Crypto is much much easier to hide, transact and secure. Banning Bitcoin will only ensure it gets the upgrades that could otherwise take decades or more.

The first major benefit of a full on ban would be finally reaching consensus to upgrade bitcoin with privacy features. Bitcoin would get Mimble Wimble or something similar faster than Charlie Lee can make another false Litecoin promise. Bitcoin would go back to being the private store of value that it was originally intended as. The only reasons we can't agree on making BTC private is because too many would be concerned about scaring away institutional money or losing government indifference. Well, there's no institutional money or indifference if BTC is banned. Side note: Let's not forget that chains like Monero will be right at home under these circumstances. Future decenteralized exchanges will be easier and better to operate. This will add to the appeal of private networks.

Not only would BTC privacy upgrades be highly likely and fast paced, but sweeping network scalability upgrades would be the logical next step. All miners would be at a massive net loss and network security would be at risk. BTC would likely move to a staking model and the old chain would only be run as a historical network. Public social consensus will pave the road necessary to realize the new BTC network as the ""real"" Bitcoin. Snap shots, air drops and coordinators would make the transition easy and full of options.

A staked, private, code-able and properly scaled BTC network would open the doors for private transactions, micro transactions, private smart contracts and even features like off chain peer-2-peer in person transacting. There would be absolutely no way to fight this and this would be the worst outcome for any government looking to stop digital world monetary systems run by the public.

Honestly, this is the reason I don't think there will ever be a full on ban, but governments don't always think long term. Governments are better off just leaving things be. The community is already too nervous to really upgrade Bitcoin and a large percent just spend their energy fighting over which coin is better. Coming together for financial freedom has become a low priority... If even a priority.

So no, I don't believe banning Bitcoin will do anything but make it much stronger in the long term."

1054,"> There is no problem

Someone has the ability to double spend, or vastly slow down the network by refusing to process any transactions that arent their own. This a massive problem that gets exponentially worse every 10 minutes they are doubling their stack of BTC essentially...

The problem with forking BTC means you are now Ditching SHA 256. so All ASIC's are useless, so you go back to GPU mining for a while (which means the network becomes more vulnerable to attacks) and you also need the community to come to an agreement on which new algorithm or system functions you are changing are ""best"" and the community has a horrific track record of not coming to agreement and a lot of infighting over the basics.... There is no way forward after a 51% attack except Multiple forks. which is a massive issue.

>By the time btc gets that big it becomes a threat the amount of money required to 51% attack it could be stupid. 

To the chinese government the amount of money it costs to attack it is equivalent to the cost of about 4-5 rounds of 7.62 ammunition. that's about.. 50 cents in cost to them?

Because of the Byzantine General Problem, you cannot ""break up your problem in small pieces and have the nodes each compute a small piece of the problem"". Most, if not all blockchains do the exact opposite: every Bitcoin node calculates each and every transaction. Every Ethereum node runs *all* the smart contract code for a transaction.

With Ethereum, your cryptokitty smart contract is ran on thousands of computers in parallel. Each one coming to the same outcome. 

Sharding in ETH will distribute the computing a little. But the nature of permissionless blockchains requires a majority of nodes to run a piece of code on each and every computer over again.

Except that is wrong and incorrect.

&#x200B;

When you double spend you are NOT creating new money, you are changing the address you sent it to.

Example.

I send 1BTC to you...the block chain says I sent 1 BTC to you...

You have been paid 1BTC according to the block chain...you send me my product...

I the attacker, do a 51% attack and instead of sending you the 1 BTC, I send it to myself on my secret chain I have been mining without telling the network.

I now release my 51% attacked chain which is longer than the one I sent you money on.

Everyone on the network agrees, this longer chain is the valid one, not the one I sent you money with.

The money I sent you on the other chain never happened, everyone agrees this new chain is the real one.

How was money printed or created in this example?

NO MONEY WAS CREATED!

Only the destination of the BTC I sent to you was changed back to me, so it was sent to me instead.

&#x200B;

Even with double spend attacks, there will only ever be 21 million BTC. None are minted or created during a 51% attack.

you and I both know legislation wont stop BTC (it has already failed to do so in multiple countries)  The only way to stop it is to erode the trust/make the chain tainted. the only way to do that is to prolong a 51% attack.

1152,"lol, it is indeed what that entire convo is saying.  if you dont want to look into things yourself or would rather just get spoonfeed nonsense by someone who says in the report 

""the image depicts some complexity in the process and the BitMEX Research team is unable to understand the detailed inner workings of the system or how it has any of the convergent properties necessary for consensus systems.""

then be my guest, but you are quoting and following a report that has been proven to be full of misinformation/lies and even openly admits to not understand what the heck they are talking about

read for yourself

https://www.xrpchat.com/topic/32657-bob-i-could-use-some-help-clarifying-these-claims/?tab=comments#comment-758942"
1153,What's your reasoning?
1154,"Right that is true, if some 51% attack wiped away days of transactions then Bitcoin devs could release a new Bitcoin client hard-coded to accept the original transaction history as the valid fork and ignore the blocks created in the attack. But co-ordinating hard forks is quite hard and if the community was forced to do this, say, semi-monthly, it could lead to enough instability to prevent the coins from being usable as money."
1155,The fork would require changing hash algorithm away from sha256 so the attackers ASICs couldn't be used. Then mining would be all GPUs again assuming they go with something new. If the attacker is ready for that with GPUs then bitcoin would be destroyed as there's no where left to go and any fork can be ruined by the attacker. So PoW chains can be destroyed absolutely with a 51% attack. With PoS the attackers funds can be slashed as soon as they do anything wrong and the problem is solved.
1156,"No. It's much simpler. When the 51% attack ends (probably after a few hours) anyone who had transactions settled shortly before the 51% happened is hit by a rollback. That's the effect of a 51% attack. No one would rollback the Bitcoin blockchain as Ethereum did, because a ""51% attack"" is not actually an attack, but a legal way to ""use Bitcoin"", aka mine blocks.

Actually it is not even the senders that are harmed, but the receivers, so only recipients must take care. A good way for recipients to lower the risk  is to watch the hashrate for abnormal peaks after having received BTC and waiting an appropriate timeframe for important settlements (= big transactions, like half a day or so)."
1157,They can do a single double spend. Big whoop.
1158,You know that’s not what I was talking about. When we are talking 51% attack we are talking about walking back the chain on transactions with more than 6+ confirmations.
1159,Yet 10 years later and here we are...
1160,"I don't understand your comment about there being little incentive for governments to attack Bitcoin.

I feel like nation states are the single-most vulnerable entity to this technology. Decentralisation has the capacity to unbundle almost every service that governments provide, making them redundant. Bitcoin is an existential threat to the nation state."
1161,"Complex hardware? No. It would take miners, a lot of them. Nothing “complex”. And the whole point is that a single source COULD do it. Money is all that is needed.

Whether or not the network would be forked after the attack is irrelevant.

The entire point of the original post, and what the other guy i was talking to disagreed with, was that its possible. And not difficult except for the need for money to execute it.

Disagree? Then either prove it isnt possible. Or acquiesce that it is possible."
1162,"You prove your ignorance with every word. Repeating what other people say, when you have no proof, and furthermore are wrong, doesnt make you right.

A 51% attack...is THE attack. It gives you control of the network. That you dont understand this is disturbing."
1163,"No we won't. Nano would need to become relevant before that ever happened, but it's already redundant."
1164,"Basically, yes."
1165,"I believe that there are transaction history checkpoints which get encoded into the chain itself.  If you try to go back and change history, nodes running Bitcoin Core software will notice.  Doesn’t mean they can stop it but it will be detected as a fork.  That being said, all you really need to do is confirm one fake transaction (for instance, xfer all satoshi wallet coins to your address) to significantly disrupt the ecosystem."
1166,I agree with the last part. The reason would not be all the money you’d make shorting/double spending btc. It would be a government level flex.
1167,annnd its’s done*
1168,"From all over the world?  Including China?

Some of you vastly overestimate the actual power that any government has."

1173,"If by conversation you mean xrp shills, then yes that is what they are discussing and what you are quoting. Doesn't mean they aren't entirely twisting the meaning as described. That people can run their own validators doesn't change the initial pubkey check. Validation != consensus."
1174,"Nah, it would just spawn innovation and automatic fork distribution systems."
1175,Monero just switched to randomx making cpu mining way more profitable than gpu or asic mining
1176,">No one would rollback the Bitcoin blockchain as Ethereum did, because a ""51% attack"" is not actually an attack, but a legal way to ""use Bitcoin"", aka mine blocks.

Only if no one finds out about it"
1177,"lol... they can in essence ""halt"" the network if they want, they can do actually a lot of things with 51% control.  Forking doesnt solve the problem. The community would need to ditch SHA 256 to solve the issue, the problem is then you are swapping back to GPU's which are less secure and you actually need the community to agree on what is ""best"" going forwards.... look how well that has gone in the past lol... If a 3rd party gained 51% control and chose to sit on the network, it would be dead within a month."
1178,Having 51% of the hash power means you will find a new block approximately 51% of the time. Which means in order to re-write 6 blocks you'd have to re-do the proof of work for 6 blocks by the time the other 49% of the network found one block. Now imagine trying to rewrite a transaction from 9 hours ago. It almost literally cannot be done. The way a miner can most feasibly attack the network is by producing empty blocks. Hard to even call this an attack.
1179,They haven't had any goal to bring b it down.
1180,No its not.  Its the IRS' wet dream.  Tracability of every transaction is what they want.  The idea that surveillance coin is a threat to nation states is asinine.
1181,"Anything's possible. I won't argue that it's impossible. It just seems very unlikely. And if it's done, it seems like it will likely be ineffective."
1182,"I think the best advice this sub could offer is to short anything notmyrealname and his gaggle of fake accounts pushes.   He’s laughably wrong about absolutely everything.  

At least it’s proper entertainment."
1183,How is it redundant?  What other coin is like it?
1184,\*yawns\*
1185,"> That being said, all you really need to do is confirm one fake transaction

PoW attackers can remove valid transactions from the ledger, insert their own valid transactions into the ledger, and prevent transaction confirmation. They can double-spend or censor, but they cannot spend coins they don't control. It's not possible to make the network accept a block with a fake or altered transaction. Nodes check signatures and such a block (and anything built atop it) would fail validation and be rejected."
1186,"aaaaaand it's done gone, it is."
1187,"What does that even mean? You can’t have a 0.000000001 block. Only whole numbers like 1 block or 2 blocks or 3 blocks and so on. Yeah sure, reorg is a reorg but it is NOT a 51% attack. I think you may need to do a better job of doing your own research on this stuff my man."
1188,"Its funny you seem to think that a complete erosion of trust, the only thing bitcoin has going for it, would have no effect.

Naive to the point of idiocy."
1189,"Grade school tactics, less mature than i initially gave you credit for. A defeated and neutered conversationalist resorts to childish attacks. Funny you would think anyone would care what you have to say. And terribly narrow minded to assume i dont equally support btc. 

Fool"
1190,"It couldn't be completely automated, it would have to use social coordination. Otherwise it would be vulnerable in the same ways blockchain consensus is. The process of social coordination could maybe be made very efficient if there were a set of widely trusted community leaders all working together to make it happen, but if the government started targeting these people as well and everyone had to coordinate while staying anonymous and underground, it would be difficult."
1191,"No, that isn't how the blockchain works.

If you have >50% of the hashing power, you can rewrite as far back as you want - given you have been running it for long enough.  

The reality of a 51% is that you start mining at block B, and keep the 51% chain private.  You send the coins in block B+1.  Wait for a confirmation - block B+7.  Then, you release your chain as soon as it is one block longer than the main chain.

Ex: you release 8 blocks (B+8), and since your chain is now longer than the longest alternate chain (B+7), the entire network switches to your chain - without the sent coins.

That is the strength of a 51% attack.  You can literally undo every transaction since you started the attack.

It only gets worse if you have >51% of the hashing power.  You could start reversing time, and reversing transactions that started before you even started the attack."
1192,"Despite your tone you make a decent point – governments may be less worried about the rise of crypto because it has an advantage.

I won't bother making an argument for someone who has there mind made up – good day!"
1193,"I never said it was likely, just that it is entirely possible. And its effectiveness is all relative to what the goal would be. If the goal would be to disrupt or cast doubt on the network, it would be very effective."
1194,"Was gonna say: no matter What: no key, no coin... you can't ""spend Satoshi coins"".

 Just because the bank repoed my car on paper, doesnt mean they hold the actual key, right?? :)"
1195,Clearly you didn’t get me.. was just saying a reorg is a reorg..| and is 51% attack
1196,"I never mentioned an erosion of trust, because there would be none.  It would only serve to strengthen Bitcoin.  You might consider learning about anti-fragility and how the concept applies to Bitcoin."

1199,"Not trying to throw shade, but I honestly think you're unaware of how capable systems can be, and how environmental pressures push something to become better."
1200,">It only gets worse if you have >51% of the hashing power.  You could start reversing time, and reversing transactions that started before you even started the attack.

This is so very unlikely to happen its almost impossible.

You would have to start hashing from block 1 and mine more blocks than have been mined since the start, while at the same time outpacing the new blocks being added on at the end.

Currently even with all the hash power of the network, it would still take months if not years to make a chain that long....and by that time the current real chain will have months if not years more blocks on them.

You would never be able to rewrite the entire chain, its not possible."
1201,"If you want to do this privately that's not a 51% attack, that's a 100% attack. You're out hashing the entire public network."
1202,Sorry. I didn't mean to put words in your mouth. I also don't think we're really holding different viewpoints here.
1203,Tell that to the guy on the street who doesn't know much about BTC.  Mass adoption wont happen.

* You need to seriously overhaul the text.

The first line is just stupid and the second either shows disillusion og just plain stupidity."

1213,NO.
1214,Yeah the pre-installed key doesn't sit right with me.  It'd be cool if we could use the app to generate a key and write it to the card.  Why couldn't that be done?
1215,"Keys are generated by Tangem and their process is certified by Kudelski.

Cheap website? please make suggestions...this is a work in progress."
1216,"The Key is the card...you use the app to sign transactions, verify the balance, and get the pub address."
1217,Thank you for the feedback. Will integrate.
1218,thank you for this feedback. I truly appreciate it and will integrate your suggestions.
1219,"So In this case would you see the key? Or trust that the app is securely generating the key? If the private key is seen then the card loses its utility as a bearer instrument. What could Tangem do, beyond the kudelski audit, to generate trust that that key exists only on the app"
1220,"Damn, I gotta go update my resume cuz I make memes too! I just didn't know it qualified as web development."
1221,"Kudelsky did not certify the manufacturing process and neither the key generation, just the app with the wallet functionality:

From your link: 
""Tangem provides [...] smart card storage media for Bitcoin private keys with basic wallet functionality. Tangem hired Kudelski Security to perform a security audit of **the source code written by Tangem to offer these features**""."
1222,"First, stop behaving shady. On their website they claim the Kudelski report can be downloaded in full. But when I actually followed the link Kudelski states that they actually did NOT get permission to publish the full report."
1223,Lol. I’d add it as a skill
1224,If they hack your account they can trade it for crypto...
1225,Use coinbase to store fiat. They have fdic which if stolen they replace up to 250k and I believe binance.us also has it but only for fiat
1226,"Cash is almost equally at risk in the event of an exchange hack. If they get hacked, they are either insolvent or they stay afloat. If they are insolvent, administrators are appointed and all value (crypto, cash, buildings, assets, etc) gets sold and returned to creditors (in order of priority, minus fees) - you as a user will likely see nothing. If they stay afloat they will either absorb the losses as a company (unlikely unless they’re big) or socialise the losses and give every user a haircut."
1227,"Yes it can and it has been reported even on reputable larger exchanges. If a hacker gains access to your account, they can then use your fiat to buy Bitcoin for example. Then they can withdraw the Bitcoin to a public address that they control with their private key. Your fiat would be gone and the exchange will blame you for poor account security. To guard against this you should obviously have 2FA setup on your account. But you should also have a ""whitelist"" for both your IP address and your withdrawl public addresses. That way you (or the hacker) can only withdraw to a public address that you control, not them, and as such no harm would be done. Typically adding a new whitelist public address takes 48-72 hours to occur and requires email verification from the email address that you control. IP whitelisting is also good, meaning only someone with your IP address can withdraw. Each exchange is a little different in how they implement whitelisting, so read the details on the exchange carefully. Stay safe !"
1228,They can definitely exit scam....
1229,Of course. Sometimes easier than think.
1230,Should be safe. That doesn't mean that it can't close shop though.
1231,Most people fuck this up by storing it in USDC or DAI.  Plus only US customers are insured.
1232,I'm using Kraken. Pretty safe right ?
1233,"Kraken is one of the oldest classical exchanges, it should be pretty safe. 

Another option are decentralized p2p exchanges like bisq"
1234,"If Kraken gets hacked or attacked by an internal bad actor there is nothing stopping them converting your fiat to a crypto then transferring that crypto somewhere else.    
Exchanges are not banks, one should not treat them like banks."
1235,"Yes, but create a white list for withdrawing addresses and different 2FA for login, trades and funding (3 different google authenticator codes).
Also lock the security settings with a password or a different method so it cannot be modified. You can even setup a yubikey if you are extremley paranoid."
1236,Setting 2FA auth for trades + withdrawals that also require email confirmation of newly added addresses on Kraken severely limits the risks there.
1237,Not a ton of content there
1238,"And I'd go one further as well, with who wants one? It seems like we'd just run into the same issues with FIAT."
1239,Yeah... How about I just use on chain stablecoins like Dai. I don't see how a stablecoin that's linked to state currencies is safer than currencies themselves.
1240,So do the state can print Digital Coins or Tokens in demand.
1241,Can they agreed on one coin to rule them all.
1242,another ICO saga

1247,Ever heard for inflation?
1248,That's your opinion but it's totally wrong. A US government crypto would be the last place I'd want my money.
1249,They'll just freeze it at will instead.  IRS suspects you underpaid?  Watch out.  Poof goes your government digital currency from your account.  Have been sued and lost--maybe didn't even show up to court?  Watch out.  Poof goes your government digital currency from your account.  Just like China.  No due process.  Worse even than what was envisioned in the classic 1984.

1252,"Hardcoded fixed inflation and let the gov use that for all government spending. Remove all taxes. All gov expenses transparent and auditable on the open blockchain. If gov needs more money they need to increase the purchasing power of their dollar. Of course, this can't scale TX wise with current blockchain tech but could be better than the existing monopoly money that is traditional fiat. The goal would be stable and transparent currency suitable for trade and trust. Not a store of value."

1255,"**Executive Order 6102**

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States"".  The order was made under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act the previous month.

The limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93–373 which went into effect December 31, 1974.

Oh, kewwwl."
1285,This isn't likely to be positive news for the community. Same governor stole the election from Stacey Abrams.
1286,Nothing new tbh.
1287,"She comes from humble origins tho.

She used to be a millionaire."
1288,We have reached Peak decentralization
1289,She doesn’t have to mention it to support it
1290,Here's a clue. This isn't the most positive community.
1291,"What do you mean she used to be a millionaire? She lives in a $10,000,000 mansion in Atlanta. Her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is the Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. Furthermore, I don't see anything in her past that qualifies her to be a U.S. Senator."
1292,"Yea, uh, pretty obvious that she does, considering her background."
1293,She used to be a millionaire.(now probably billionaire) What other qualifications does a politician need ?
1294,Now she's a billionaire (with her husband).
1295,"Tim Draper ""Some get put into jail, and some become billionaires"".

Personally I agree with Tim so far that Ross Ulbricht should eventually be released and the ""double-life sentence without parole"" that he was given was fucking absurd, to say the least. I think Ulbricht should have made more responsibility to monitor and censor what was being traded (Eg, murder for hire, cp and identity fraud) and should be punished for that. However, there is too much focus on him and not the punishment of the criminals who used the platform. Anyone can (and has) organise a crime through Facebook, yet the Zuck still cruises around freely.

I think the sentiment that ""Some get put into jail, and some become billionaires"" is disturbingly accurate."
1296,Pedophiles get less time than him.
1297,"I believe that the conviction of Ross was one of the first failed attempts to demonize Bitcoin and intimidate its believers or potential adopters. The majority of people who heard about Bitcoin was through this story and what remained in their subconscious is that it is all about illegal activities, unfortunately. It is sad that after so long time since then, due to the lack of people's research on the topic or even manipulation from the news, this belief prevailed."
1298,"The scariest part about what happened to Ross is that there was a copy-cat of his website that got taken down a couple years later, and the owner of the copy-cat website only spent two weeks in a jail cell."
1299,**So frigging tired of hearing price predictions.**
1300,"His prediction is around when the New blood will enter the market, and the big players pull the rug."
1301,That what she said
1302,It’s never going to happen.
1303,[deleted]
1304,Two years past it's ATH and it's barely 7k? And you're talking 250k? Lol not going to happen.
1305,Please go up Bitcoin! So that this guy can get his dental procedure.
1306,"The murder for hire charges against Ulbricht were dropped after making headlines in the news. The judge cited this charge in his sentencing despite his innocence of that charge and at least two of the undercover agents involved were later convicted of more heinous crimes, in my opinion. I'm not sure if murder for hire was traded on the original silk road, but the creators of similar sites following the fall of silk road were offered plea deals with no jail time. Ross was meant to be an example and he was sentenced on false pre-tenses. I say let the man go free."
1307,"> Anyone can (and has) organise a crime through Facebook, yet the Zuck still cruises around freely.

True, how about these law dog schmucks charge zucky for aiding and abetting the NZ terrorist and many other terrorists for a start?"
1308,I think the issue was precisely what you mentioned. He knew what was going on with respects to his website and did nothing about it. Facebook has builtin algorithms to monitor for unscrupulous activities as well as a reporting mechanism for users to report questionable activities. Ross's imprisonment was a LOUD message that regulators and legal authorities wanted to send to the crypto world. Just like the Ethereum developer who supposedly went to educate N. Korea on how to evade sanction using Ethereum etc. It's like why would you put yourself in this kind of situation especially when you were counseled/advised NOT to go to?
1309,"A person who ""enables"" 1000 pedos is worse than any single one of pedos. 

That's how lawmakers think. Not me, so don't shoot the messenger."
1310,"Law enforcement never goes after every single criminal.

They have limited resources/lawyers, prosecutors, energy, time, budget, and have to choose between options all the time. 

Thats why so many plea deals are signed. Including with offenders such as rapists etc. Its not the case that the prosecutors like the rapists.

Some prosecutors may, but not all."
1311,Life without parole seems appropriate to you for narcotic trafficking?
1312,"He actually wasn’t personally trafficking narcotics, he held dominion over a marketplace that allowed for trafficking of narcotics and benefitted monetarily from it"
1313,He was not personally trafficking narcotics.  He simply created and ran a truly free and open marketplace. Something like 80% of sales on the site were simply for marijuana which is now legal for the rich and powerful to sell in about half the country.
1314,"what the hell do you think cryptocurrency is for? are you lost? he was a peaceful individual offering a platform for consenting adults to buy stuff that don't harm any third person, and neither you nor the state should have any fucking regard to this"
1315,"I think you don't have the full facts with regards to murder for hire charges. There is absolutely no evidence that the murders occurred - the courts did not (and could not) tie any known murders to Ross's hiring of hitmen. But when you observe the chat records, Ross fully paid for the killing of 5 individuals, and the hitman actually convinced him that he did, in fact, commit the murders (he sent photo evidence to convince Ross). So from Ross's point of view, those were successful hits that he paid for.

Now I'm blurry about the following, but the real identity of the hitman Ross hired, and the identity of the victims are not known as far as I'm aware. They are users from Silk Road and it all started because some vendor threatened to release the names and addresses of their clients thus compromising the site's anonymity - because they had a dispute with another user / vendor (complaining that they weren't paid what they were owed). From there it escalated. Ross thought he managed to get this vendor killed, then seeing how easy it was, moved on to other targets.

The first target was the vendor that threatened to release the info, and the second target was someone who works with the first target, the other 3 were the associates of the second target. The hitman Ross hired was actually (supposedly) the supplier of the first target who saw him as a liability. In reality, they all might be the same person or a couple of friends scamming Ross of course. In any case, Ross fully believed that he was able to get those people killed, and took notes of when he paid for those hits, and their results. Also the government was able to link the payments from Ross's wallets to the hitman on his computer that was seized.

Start from Page 19 here if you want to see how things transpired: [https://www.pbwt.com/content/uploads/2017/05/15-1815\_opn.pdf](https://www.pbwt.com/content/uploads/2017/05/15-1815_opn.pdf)"
1316,Yeah the actions of the arresting offers is a huge part of Ross' story that both I and the interview leave out.
1317,"Pedophilia groups, revenge porn groups, extremist groups... the list goes on."
1318,"Ross didn't enable a single pedo, though. CP was forbidden on SR."
1319,That parole part is certainly bullshit. Even Manson gets parole hearings. With no parole possible you can't even pretend that federal prison is about rehabilitation in all cases.
1320,"Drug sentencing in the States is very harsh. Although I guess its better than if he was caught in the far east, probably have been executed.

&nbsp;

Here in Canada we are much more lenient"
1321,He did actually grow and  sell mushrooms for a time IIRC I think when will road was just starting.
1322,my mom buys pounds of weed off FB
1323,He was trying to recruit new sellers to the site and tried to have multiple men killed during the process. His message logs from the site are the source of that info.
1324,"he started it by selling his own mushrooms

but regardless, he is a peaceful person, nothing else matters"
1325,He definitely sold drugs when SR was starting up so that there would be something on it.
1326,"I appreciate the link and I admit the evidence presented against him looks damning on the surface. However, the vast majority of the evidence against him is digital which could have been fabricated. Worst case scenario he paid over a $500k for some gruesome pics regardless of his intention. I find it highly suspicious the two corrupt officers were involved in at least the one attempted murder case. I don't think we can be sure his DPR account wasn't compromised prior to his arrest. I would even argue the government had motive to frame him on these charges considering sales on the silk road were cutting into CIA cocaine trafficking profits, not to mention it would strengthen their case for the criminal enterprise charge. This was one of his defenses as noted on pgs 22-23.

I'd also urge you to consider the argument his defense makes on pgs 30-31 stating that the site reduced violence associated with the drug trade. This makes perfect sense to me- no hand to hand purchases mean less potential for conflict and no territory to protect. In any classic drug trafficking organization on this scale, undeniably a lot more people would have died- either through direct physical violence or indirectly causing overdoses by cutting the product. The court implied this was a delusional argument and even used it to justify a longer sentence (pg 121).

I bought the media narrative on the murder for hire for many years until I heard his mom talk about the case. I'm not saying she has all the facts or is fully aware of what her son was doing during that period, but I'd recommend hearing her out."
1327,"facebook tries to fight that, not facilitate it. How low IQ are you to even compare them?"
1328,"I replied in the context of the comment I replied to.

He started comparing him with pedos first. Its supposed to be an example, but you'd have to ask that dude."
1329,If I remember correctly the “tried to have people killed” was hearsay and never actually admitted to court as evidence
1330,y'all were right about the mushroom thing- that was news to me. Thanks for the correction.
1331,I stand corrected- looks like he did grow/sell some mushrooms on the site at first
1332,"Facebook is currently embroiled in a controversy because the platform wants to allow (ie, facilitate) political ads that wilfully spread lies and propaganda. 

Some of these ad campaigns encourage hate speech, racism and violence. 

I wouldn't say the two are so far apart, when you look at it from a moral perspective. Zuckerburg is making just as much money off other's wrongdoing and Ulbricht did."
1333,"They try to fight some of the above mentioned groups, others they ignore or just half heartedly ban."
1334,"It wasn't admitted as evidence so you're right but it is very clearly what the person using his account on silk road was asking for. His argument was it could be anyone, which is true. My personal opinion is he was the only one in control of that account."
1335,And they should be prosecuted for repeatedly failing to do so as well as lying to congress several times
1336,"The negative interest rates are for large retail clients. Also most cryptos aren't a ""better store of value"", they are a speculative store of value, quite a different thing"
1337,"most germans are to dump or narrow-minded to look outside of banks. They trust every dick head in a suit.

1339,With the bulk of my savings I’d still rather take the slightly negative rate rather than risk the volatility on crypto.
1340,"Major cryptos, risk adjusted return is highest on the planet, definitely a store of value, if managed properly. But for most of people, they don't even know that is ""risk adjusted return"""
1341,Why in Berlin then do they dislike credit cards so much and endorse cash?
1342,Why not just hold USDC or Dai
1343,"There are many crypto projects where you can stake and gain a higher positive yield. Check ATOM, Harmony"
1344,It’s “slightly negative” for the moment. That may not be the case in the future and with the uncertainty in global markets there is a good chance withdrawals will be a nightmare.
1345,Dai a good idea
1346,Why not just hold USD?
1347,You’re still then tied to a highly volatile asset. A days move can wipe out staking gains for the past year.
1348,"Not sure why you were down voted. In addition, once everyone's on a state digital currency negative rates can go as low as they want. It's admitted openly.

1351,"> Against Trump's Wishes

Didn't Loeffler make a 100k donation to the Trump campaign?"
1352,Before a mod says this isn't relevant. Loeffler is the CEO of Bakkt and her being a US Senator should mean good things for crypto in the US.
1353,"Ya, she literally said she is 'pro-trump' in her public remarks."
1354,Bakkt futures aren't fully backed by Bitcoin nor are the reserves verified. Plus I don't think it's clear whether traders can take delivery in Bitcoin. Bakkt is probably bad for crypto. It will likely be used to suppress the price just like futures have been used to suppress the price of precious metals.
1355,"Bakkt has been bad for crypto. Futures markets almost always keep the price of the commodity (or coin) down. She may be in a crypto-related business, but that particular business is not for the greater good of crypto."
1356,"Honestly, good or bad for the price of crypto this will help bring it to the public eye which is really the best thing we could hope for for the future of crypto."
1357,[deleted]
1358,They are not bakkt you say?
1359,"Fair enough, but one could argue that stable prices would encourage more folks to adopt using the coins. Further, devil's advocate argument is mo one but gamblers and speculators, is going to use BTC/ETH as a store of value when they swing so wildly."
1360,"I do not know. Maybe he has another reason, but I dont put much research into what he has clunking around in his head."
1361,"Trump and the GOP had preferred a different appointment. Which is of course explained in the article attached to said headline...

>The president, who stumped for Kemp ahead of his narrow victory in Georgia's gubernatorial race last year, reportedly wanted him to appoint Rep. Doug Collins, a staunch Trump ally and the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee."
1362,"Yes, but the problem is that institutional investors who have far more money than average investors or crypto investors will use the futures markets to keep the price of a top threat, Bitcoin and other cryptos, down...and make money in the process. The rest of us can't compete with the amount of money they leverage. They are the ultimate whale, if you will, and futures markets give them the tool they need to seriously hamper crypto's adoption, profitability, and usability."
1363,"One of the biggest reasons (I think) why BTC and others aren't adopted more fully is their huge volatility - it hampers them as a legitimate store of value and makes trade really difficult. A futures market helps to even that out as it does manage expectations. However, I do agree with you, and that it's a complicated marriage of institutional money being involved. However, unfortunately, you can't shove that cat back into the bag. A senator who is pretty well versed in BTC and it's futures is definitely not a bad thing though for adoption. Some of the folks in the House and Senate didn't even know what Facebook was two years ago, so this definitely raises the bar on folks who ""get it""."
1364,"And nothing anybody can do about this, though shitty it's perfectly legal"
1365,13% pump is nothing in cryptoland.. and have you seen binance/CZ's profits? They have better ways to make profit than 13% gain on a coin with $10m volume on binance
1366,If you look at the chart and the announcement you will know it's 100% Insider pump. Insiders made a good 10% on their 100-150 BTC Invested. Goof for you Binance. Good for you.
1367,"How is anything in crypto insider trading? It's not regulated by Regulation FD, so there's no such thing as MNPI..."
1368,"""But its the wild west!"" DX"
1369,Just assumed every trading platform was already using back end statistics to make profit.
1370,"With all the scandals related to Binance as of late, I wonder why people still use them. Sure they've got the most assets listed, but there are PLENTY of alternatives who does a way better job managing their exchange. I stopped using Binance after the Blocknet scandal, where they literally tried to steal Blocknet's DEX ideas, and refused to list them at the same time. 

What a joke...."
1371,"Someone should probably look at what they were doing with MATIC and those others. The volume on them was absolutely ridiculous, sort of unexplained, and turned on and off like a switch."
1372,This is Best for VeriCoin.
1373,Tell me which exchange doesnt have insider trading
1374,"Ask yourself wouldnt you do it if you could?

Not a fan boy CZ nor hating him but I think he and all Binance employees have made a lot to crypto as whole and they will continue to do so. Yeah you can hope that this space would be fully decentralized, uncorrupt, fair, transparent,... but hey humans are greedy and think for themself before others. I have accepted that crypto won't fully change our societies for the better. Still pretty sure crypto/blockchain will have a positive impact though"

1376,your cheque from cz is in the mail
1377,And everyone has known this is going on for ages. Every coin listed on Binance miraculously this kind of trading around listing time
1378,Obviously CZ isn't going to be doing it. It's penny's to him. Binance believe it or not does have employees who would stand to gain.
1379,Just because you can't be prosecuted for something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
1380,People will go where the liquidity is unfortunately
1381,Scandals? You mean unsubstantiated rumors?
1382,BISQ
1383,Its hard not to do it when it is perfectly legal
1384,I think anyone that's traded on a crypto exchange figures this out...I hope at least. That feeling that the whole exchange must be working against just you isn't too far off.
1385,"All the articles/posts in this space talking about insider trading seem to imply its a criminal action though, the phrase carries weight"
1386,"Well there's MULTIPLE proofs on the Blocknet scandal, since all the documents was released for the public to view."
1387,Lots of grey areas they've exploited... And are still exploiting.
1388,"It carries weight, in a court of law. This is Reddit."
1389,"Sorry, providing evidence that they were asked in-depth due diligence questions in-line with our stringent listing processes doesn't equate to providing evidence that we ""stole their ideas"" (spoiler: we didn't). Try again?"
1390,"Please let me know WHY they where asked about how their DEX works etc. etc? Completely unrelated to the listing process, and then after Blocknet replied, they where IGNORED, and never heard back from Binance.

1461,"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania (Dutch: tulpenmanie) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis. Historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

1463,"Absolutely zero way it won't be a permissioned network which requires normal background checks to participate in, whom's nodes are private and whom's transactions are monitored and censored. Central banks won't make CBDC that can bypass sanctions."
1464,"There is a lot of conflicting news on the Petro, its hard for an outsider to tell how real it is. There were many reports of presale coins not being delivered. But more recent reports say that the Petro is functioning as its own blockchain, and some people are being paid in it, but its actual use is still not widespread, even in Venezuela. So I guess the verdict is still out on it, but if it is just mass issued, like the Bolivar, its hard to see it having any kind of success, but it is still possible."
1465,"It does if its issuance enables individual citizens and companies to hold assets directly with the central bank. In it's simplest form, account holders would be able to have as easy payment processing as they already have but with the added benefit of receiving the overnight rate for interest on holdings. These are the types of economic arguments you'll start to hear from central bankers. We'll hear a lot less about the privacy component, or lack there of,  which is a big part of the push we'll see for e-coins (not traditional cryptocurrency).

The cost of maintaining the accounts and performing transactions can be downloaded to the network however constructed, ultimately lowering the transaction costs of this type of direct central bank account that e-coins could enable.

Slapping a blockchain on it could mean shit, if central bank issued wallets have any interoperability with cryptocurrency wallets or crypto exchanges, what I see as the more likely option, but still far from a certainty. 

Either way, apart from the halving, I'd say state issued e-coins is the topic to watch in 2020."

1495,Ripple has a great used case.
1496,10 corridors but only 4 countries. The network effect is gonna be  huge.
1497,"""Being used"" is a little bit far fetched. I would count USD to MXN and PHP and even those are still in ramping up phase. The rest is still early testing. Interesting and promising none the less.

The AUD USD is even missing here. It is ""used"" by FlashFX to fund Bitstamp."
1498,But they will never use XRP.
1499,Being used means being used...... and its being used...
1500,ODL -is- the buying and selling of XRP as a liquidity provider.
1501,NEVER!!!1! REEEEEEEEEE!
1502,And I'm sure the number of corridors and volume are just going to increase over time.
1503,"You are new here, aren't you?"
1504,"Of course it's a scam!!!!

They will most likely ask you to deposit an amount of BTC before you're able to access the BTC ""you have won"".

Typical Nigerian Prince scam...
""I will give you 1.000.000 USD but I need you to send me 10.000 USD so I can release the funds""

Use your brain!"
1505,"You need to ""verify"" your identity before being able to do anything and they simply sell that data you provide them. So its TOTALLY a scam."
1506,"Wut, I just got this comment too. Seems to be rather new if it is a scam. I'll check it out."
1507,"yeah I understand that, however, the website looked really professional and just wanted to ask if anyone knew the site. I knew it was most likely a scam just askin to be 100% sure. I don't want to missout on that amount of money xd."
1508,Alright thanks
1509,"Official looking (BTC) scam websites can be easily bought off the dark net.
I've seen fake online stores, fake crypto exchanges, fake casino websites, you name it.
They're up for sale for 250-1000 USD.

Especially the crypto related websites are easy to set up. You would only have to change some wallet addresses that only the scammer has access to.

Then buy a domain, upload your files, let a bot contact as many people on Reddit, Telegram, etc... to lure them into believing they have won BTC and there you go...
There's no doubt in my mind people are still falling for it on a daily basis.

I could set up the whole thing in under an hour if I wanted to.

Don't be fooled by ""how really professional a website looks""!"
1510,It's a big scam boi
1511,Thanks for the info
1512,Makes sense. Thanks
1513,"Is anyone surprised? He knows there are absolute bulps in this community that care more about the marketing than the logic behind the idea.

My opinion : Yes he did / will make money from this circus, and the poepl who ""invested"" in this shit will have to deal with the loses.

If you are stupid enough to fall for this crap, you shouldn't be investing in this space at all."
1514,What are the differences between Bitconnect and HEX?
1515,It's not a scam if you tell everyone in advance they are actually participating in a ponzi amarite.
1516,"if it looks like a ponzi and smells like a ponzi, it's a ponzi."
1517,HEY HEY HEY!
1518,Hexconneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeccccccccccttttttttttttttttttttttt
1519,Scam 100%
1520,The SEC is gonna have fun with this one.
1521,Fucking scammer....
1522,He should be reported to financial crime institutions.
1523,"Its a ponzi scheme, strait up. I honestly can't believe this shit is still happening. Both in terms of life in general i.e. how does any human person fall for a ponzi scheme. And also in crypto, where we know there are people actively trying to create ponzi schemes, I mean bitconnect went tits up less than a year ago. I know that is eternity in crypto time, but what the fuck."
1524,"All I can say is dump your airdrop ASAP, if there is any value there, better you get it than someone else."
1525,stay away from that shit
1526,Hey hey heeeeeyyy
1527,he is smart bloke but he failed to realize the value of eth when first came and advised people to avoid it and this didnt turn so well for him as he regrets it many times in his videos
1528,"Here comes another guy that will surprisingly die in India, where is enough to show up and say ""hey I died"" to get death certificate"
1529,"Getting a free airdrop is one thing but by accepting ETH for Hex,  he just created a security. The SEC is no joke."
1530,Where did you get that 3m figure? When I checked last night the ETH address only had 100k in it
1531,Is there any downside or risk at all possible to claiming this coin through the needed steps?  I’m not really familiar with “signing” a transaction or all that this process entails.
1532,Lots of people being negative towards HEX because the rewards will go down pretty quickly. In one day when the bonuses are gone people will likely be more positive towards HEX. All I can say is that you should do your own research instead of listening to anons.
1533,"Honestly, just when you thought people in this space are finally starting to savvy up to all the bullshit scammers out there, they all pile into HEX..   


It's a fucking ETH grab masquerading as a free bitcoin airdrop. Give everyone a bunch of worthless tokens in the hopes that a handful will actually pay ETH to get more. And who gets the ETH at the end of it? You guessed it, fucking Richard Heart.   


WAKE UP"
1534,Unpopular opinion: a P2P time deposit on ethereum is one of the more valuable defi projects. So why shouldn't it be valued that much?
1535,What I’ve learned from the past in crypto is to be open for every opportunity.
1536,I would love to meet someone IRL who bought HEX. Would love to hear how they justify it.
1537,"I didn’t see a reason not to claim free hex, but won’t be purchasing any"
1538,Bitconnect pretended to be a good investment.
1539,"Bitconnect had [not just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SerREQ93g_I) one, [but two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXRhIXp4idM) high production music videos :D"
1540,WASSSA WASSSA WASSA WASSSSSUP!!
1541,"""excuse me sir, I am about to murder you ok?"" *Stab*"
1542,its called greed budy
1543,Doesn't this fucking scammer live in Florida?  wonder if his disclaimer is good enough to keep the SEC away
1544,Locked for a year arnt they lol
1545,Bitcoin heeeeeeeeeexxxxxx!!!
1546,^^   *this*   -- ...and he certainly fixed that problem for himself this week.
1547,"So the deposit address is then transferred to an internal address. The total as of writing this is 22991 ETH.

 [https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0x2b591e99afE9f32eAA6214f7B7629768c40Eeb39](https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0x2b591e99afE9f32eAA6214f7B7629768c40Eeb39)"
1548,"It is in principle there is no doubt about that.

However, sending eth to a private wallet and receiving an arbitrary amount of tokens which will arbitrarily go up in number over an arbitrary amount of time sounds a bit 'hollow' right. It's not like compound or something like that where there is actual peer to peer lending, this is sort of just, creating value out of thin air and then hoping some liquidity forms underneath it."
1549,That would be wise
1550,Pretty easy to justify it tbh. Dogecoin is a meme coin that is worth a quarter of a billion dollars. Utility value doesn't exist apparently.
1551,And they had The Carlos Matos.
1552,And how many does HEX have?
1553,"Nah, I don't think he's said publicly where exactly he lives, but somewhere in Europe."
1554,Dump your 10% lol
1555,"Totally agree, thats why i am also staying away from minting HEX via AA for now. I want to see it getting used and building liquidity.
Just throwing out that in theory this is a cool defi project, which elevates the whole ecosystem in contrast of other guys screaming scam with no real arguments.
The minting contract is the same as EOS, so by that metric all ico projects are scams (which is debatable)"
1556,"Dogecoin is obviously dogshit, but at least it has _some_ liquidity  

If you buy dogecoin you're likely very stupid. If you buy HEX you're a cunthair above fully braindead."
1557,"Yeah I think that is a good approach to it, it's not to say that it won't have value just on pure network and social media attention alone, which it does have. I assume it's a matter of time before it gets properly supported on some DEX.

My bigger issue with it was the way they keep insisting it's just 'donations' and 'self minting' etc so it can't possibly be a security and that it's really revolutionary and all that overly defensive mentality in the social media channels!

At the end of the day it is simply an ICO for an ERC20 with an inflationary staking model, which as you say has been done before and isn't anything new, but of course doesn't stop it gaining traction."
1558,Liquidity is a temporarily problem? HEX has three upcoming exchange listings and one it just opened (Bidesk). I don't think liquidity is a long-term problem. What do you hold btw? Chinese Unsafe Centralization Dump-based Pollutionary Coin?
1559,"Fucking shill lol 

I hope HEX brings you happiness and vast riches you fucking dolt"
1560,"Lol people getting salty as fuck over this. Tell me what's the difference between hex and almost any other token in this space? 99% of crypto projects with ""serious, world changing"" goals don't even need a fucking token attached to them in the first place. Their market value comes solely from their marketing efforts. No one uses this shit in the real world.

 Blockchain is a great technology. Most crypto is absolutely worthless though. At least he's telling you the main purpose of HEX is to try and play the speculative game. Which is why everyone is here for anyway if they're being honest with themselves. Free claim and see where the chips fall. Who cares? If you don't want to spend anything then don't send anything to AA."

It’s in our nature to create kings and warlords to rule us. The consumer is ultimately to blame for the existence of nearly every billionaire by the vote we cast with our money.

Safe Network is in the finishing stage now, finally!  Hopefully some fireworks next year."
1629,"Agreed. In addition, trustlessness brings strict limitations. How is that going to work with increasing capacity and speed demand?"
1630,"The current internet infrastructure is very robust and most of it is totally fine a neutral. 

There are three Tiers of internet Infrastructure.

Tier 1 internet infrastructure is the actually cables that go between continents under the sea and such transfering internet trafic. 

Tier 2 are like the hubs in each continent that futher distribute cables and stuff to various parts of the country/continent. Tier 2 buys internet transit from Tier 1, and then sells that to Tier 3.

Tier 3 internet providers are the ones we actually buy our internet from. These are the anoying ones, as they are the ones who can throttle your speed and potentially censor. Tier 2 and Tier 1 don't really care. They just want to sell their internet transit/trafic. 

There is definitly no need to replace Tier 1. Tier 1 is great infrastructure and is needed to transfer between continents fast. Tier 2 is also pretty fine, as they just relay it to Tier 2. Tier 3 is also ok as long as they cannot throttle specific sites/apps, peer in on users private data, and cannot censor. 

The beauty of Elastos carrier is you do not need to replace this infrastructure. The infrastructure is really good. We can easily get 100 Mbp/s which is really fast. What needs to be modified is the protocol. Elastos Carrier routes traffic in a different way. As of now, when internet trafic is routed, it all needs to be passed through a central server at some point. For instance when you go to a webiste, traffic first goes to a big server/database that translates the URL into an IP address. If the company owning this server decides to blacklist a URL, people can't use it. This also makes internet trafic routing predictable, and also it means that if you shut down the server, or if the censor cuts off trafic to certain IP/DNS addresses, you can effectivley censor certain website or apps. With Elastos, internet traffic is relayed peer to peer. This means traffic does not need to go to a central server first, so there is no way to censor or shut down. If there is not a direct route between peers, then traffic will hop between others peers on the network(relays), until it gets to the end users. ISP peering in on private user data is solved by encrypting all network trafic. This also means relays cannot look in on the data. Only the person with the correct public key private key pair can see.

This is a good solution. We don't really need to replace all the physics infrastructure, and competing against ISP is not a good idea. They are hugely powerful, and will use lobbying to try and destory anything that tries to destroy them. With Elastos, they are still getting paid so they don't care. Elastos just protects users from ISPs, whil still using their very robust infrastructure."
1631,Various bits of wireless spectrum are public use so a worldwide open mesh network is possible. Would be cool to see some microsat and low wavelength repeaters for this purpose
1632,"The infrastructure can be owned by a few, as economies of scale will usually prevail, but the best defence is to stop those players capturing the whole value chain. Net neutrality, encryption and preventing broad data capture are steps in the right direction."

1640,"Because just like with Tor or I2P or any other decentralized internet you can run this at a higher OSI model, a higher abstract layer. They run Tor over cables running TCP running IP running Tor. The infrastructure won't be a problem because we are able to obfuscate our channels so they either look like normal web browsing or encrypted garble. So long as there is a way to encrypt your communication there will be a way to run decentralized applications on top of the current infrastructure.

With the death of Net Neutrality though this whole argument does come into question... As they now could have it be a pay to use service or change the foundation of the infrastructure altogether.

Once this happens the internet will be owned by a small few, the poor will have to pay for the services they never had to before and around that time the world will probably be melting and roasting and a war will break out and ppl hopefully will riot.

1666,"Oh good lord ""it's in our nature to create warlords and give power to the few""? U sure it isn't people that gain power will do whatever they can to keep it? Maybe take the blame off the poor peasants just a lil bit there bud....

""The consumer is to blame for billionaires"" - so u don't think someone like Bezos or Zucc purposefully create a system where you are at a severe disadvantage to not use it, since most companies have Facebook pages, most businesses purchase from Amazon. Most ppl need to work. Most ppl do this by working at businesses that have FB pages and buy Amazon.

Sorry for not wanting to sell oranges by the freeway? But to say it's the CONSUMERS fault for being stuck in a faulty, curupt system that takes advantage of them as much as possible is about as silly as saying I have purchasing power to make a difference and ""vote"" with my $ when I barely have enough money for rent or food and work 40+ hrs. a week at a minimum wage job.

How u can blame the every day Joe for the failure of capitalism only can make sense if you are saying that because we are in the capitalist society that is failing we also are at fault. Even with that faulty logic there are many arguments that poor/most people CAN'T move vertically, it's configured that way. 

Capitalism - rich get richer poor get poorer. That's not the poor ppls fault. 

Also your wrong about decentralized internet with no central authority. If ppl want to ""be with their chosen warlord"" then they can, but that doesn't change the fact that since it's decentralized they have just as much ""power"" or incentive or just plain ability to move to anywhere else; that is the beauty of decentralization.

Tor is a great example of the power in decentralization. Have the ability to make where and what you want to go and create with no central authority to subscribe to. Multiple exit nodes, at least 3 in the onion routing hops, all encrypted so no one can figure out and manipulate. 

If they don't break up Big Tech decentralization will be the future. I2P, Roboshare, WoT rings, anon coms like Riot.im. etc.

These r all just my opinions. Peace."
1667,"DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is already working around the URL to IP problem. I'm not saying I'm down with Cloudfare but I'm in the process of running my own pi-hole DNS to HTTPS to to get around that issue.

Furthermore VPN's commonly have their own DNS and doing a leak check can prove ur all good. Encrypted connection to those DNS servers too of course. There is then the whole problem of trusting said VPN.

The internet was made from the ground up to be modular, OSPF (open shortest path first) and to have stacked protocols be the norm. This means that as long as the infrastructure is there we should be able to keep it relatively free... I hope.. the death f Net Neutrality could change all of this though as now private proprietary companies that run the Tier III infrastructure can change the rules and fuck up the whole foundation of everything else.

Sure, we can say that the cables are owned by companies. And the electricity is owned by companies. And and and...But let's start from the bottom and work our way back up. The idea that you can't modify your own iPhone without voiding the warranty because you don't ""own"" your phone is absolutely bullshit. So let's start from that foundation. First, get your own server. Then, build your own software to connect your servers. Now, you have a meshnet. Build businesses, build support, grow capital, and then we can talk about creating decentralized Internet companies if you like...But one step at a time. Holochain is laying down some major roadwork towards a decentralized Internet. There's no need to throw shade.

For those that still didn't click the link, just imagine if every piece of an app had API properties. So you want to build a new app? Cool. Do you want a chat feature? Because there's already a chat app that you can bridge to and utilize seamlessly within your own app (and not have it connected to the other IF you wish, OR have it directly connected, that choice is yours).

So, you love cat photos that you see on Facebook and Twitter, but hate Facebook and Twitter? Well, assuming that FB and Twitter were being run via holochain, you can customize your experience to have a single page/app that just scrapes all the cat photos from both of these sites because all of a sudden, the information that's within the apps is no longer explicitly owned by the apps. These are just some of the elements being constructed within holochain.

If you give a shit about being a part of one of the paths towards a better decentralized Internet, it's worth exploring. I've personally known the founders since 2013. I've been to their houses. They are the sweetest and most genuine people you've ever met and they are as humble and noble as they come. I shit you not. One of the two founders created a [decentralized schooling regimen](http://agilelearningcenters.org/) that's actually been put into practice in multiple places throughout the world.

Review Holochain critically and you'll see that it's foundations are incredibly strong."

The current Internet, despite being dominated by several big companies offering cloud computing services (Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, etc) is still partially decentralized.
And Facebook and Google invest an awful lot in physical infrastructure.

But there will always be attempts to centralize the Internet in the hands of a few people.

It could be at least a matter of debate as to whether a hybrid protocol can drift towards centralization or not.

1686,"Nice! I was kind of hoping for a response or two like this. I do disagree but incompletely. I agree that most consumers likely are not able to affect much of a change on their own but you are discounting the power of the unit. A billion dollars is made of 100 billion pennies. Each one could be considered worthless but they are collectively all that compose the billion dollars. Likewise where would Bezos or Zucchiniberg be without each of the consumers who decide to use their products? 

I agree about the onion project but ultimately even that is subject to a 51% attack on its anonymity through control of the majority of its exit nodes. Correlation attacks and all that.

My original point is. People always have a choice whether to buy or build regardless of the circumstances or consequences. Average Joe needing to use amazon and Facebook sounds like a first world problem to me.

Everyone who uses amazon and Facebook are directly mathematically to blame for the wealth of those who own those companies"
1687,"Well Tor works at a higher level. Tor runs over the infrastructure, then TCP (transmissions control protocol) then IP(sort of..) (internet protocol) and then runs its own communication on I believe the link network and application layer of the OSI model to perform encrypted hops from one layer to the other, with only the next able to decrypt the previous which then tells it what the  hop is which can only decrypt the next so on and so on. They also have bridges to avoid exit node detection and pluggable transports to obfuscate the connection to not look like Tor traffic.

It's a wonderful example of how the internet was made. It was made by DARPA for war, it's supposed to always find the shortest and fastest routable path first, be modular and stack protocols. Tor is like a top stacked protocol in a sense.....

Hope that made sense I just got off a long work day and am out of it.,.."
1688,"I meant a lot more than just financial data,i meant all the data that Google Facebook NSA and co are hoovering up daily. Financial privacy is also a big deal. 

I agree that government controlled digital currencies are clearly the worst choice. Having said that, we need to recognise that both transparency and privacy have their place. 

With the above government controlled digital currencies, we have neither, which centralises knowledge, power and surveillance capabilities.

If you have transparency on a decentralised basis, ie BTC, then at least everything is out in the open, and the individual is sovereign. Privacy coins, probably my libertarian ideal, also have their own drawbacks. I think there is room for both in a civilised society."

1691,"> If his internet does go live in 2021, who is not going to take it up? 

Almost everyone? The bandwidth is less than stellar, each satellite has roughly 20Gbps max capabity. You get 800 people in a city streaming netflix in 4k and you're already capped out. I think Elon is aiming for 3 or more satellites for a given area, which is still very limiting when most people live in cities with populations 50k+. It only really seems useful for rural areas.

> Who will continue to pay a monthly bill for internet when there's a pay once option?

That it will be a pay once option is a big assumption. If that made any sense every network provider would do it."

1693,"Mostly because I’m a huge supporter of SpaceX and I want to see them succeed. Also, I’m sick and tired of the current monopolies overcharging and underdelivering. If SpaceX delivers on the promise of gigabit speeds with fibre optic latency, than Starlink will truly be a game changer. Furthermore, imagine being able to get such a connection literally anywhere on the planet. No longer would fast reliable internet be stuck to big cities, you’d be able to get this service in the middle of the woods, desert, Antarctica, anywhere."
1694,I actually like the name Starlink a lot but I will admit it was a missed opportunity to call it Skynet.
1695,And holochain isn't even blockchain (which the dude in the interview said).
1696,">If you have transparency on a decentralised basis, ie BTC, then at least everything is out in the open

But that's not how it works in actual application. The average Joe can't afford to pay for blockchain analysis, it's once again big data that have the resources to access full oversight over average Joe's spending habits. Governments or anywhere that public oversight would be useful would never elect to use transparent blockchain (insert handwavey 'national security' justification as you wish). 

A merchant has to wait until he attempts to cash in his BTC/ETH/etc to find out if his legitimately received transparent token is tainted/blacklisted.

In my genuine and honest opinion, the place for transparency should only be at the users discretion on an individual basis."

I'm not saying BTC is the final answer, but I think BTC with truly fungible tokens (I agree this is critical) would be pretty damn close, or a model for what will replace it. I'm not discussing it's suitability to be used for day to day transactions by the way in terms of transaction speed etc."

Why? Why is it important that my neighbor knows how much I earn? Why is it important that the company I buy shampoo from online knows all the other places I have ever shopped and can build an advertising profile from what should be my private data? This is the information that you give up when you use surveillance coins.

Personally I think we're at a crossroads where if we do nothing and continue to use surveillance coins like BTC then we are electing to give away our privacy. It's a simple thing to use a crypto currency instead. 

That way you can *choose* to share the information that's relevant when you feel it's necessary.

I suspect we'll have to agree to disagree, have an upvote for discussion at any rate."
1707,[deleted]
1708,"I agree wholeheartedly with your sentiment. When I mention BTC, I don't believe it's the answer to every question. I do think a more privacy focused coin would be more ideal for day to day transactions where I agree a greater degree of privacy is desirable. We need a true, digital cash. 

However, as a store of value, when we talk about large amounts of wealth, I think that the variables there differ. There is too much at stake, and the calculus is different. 

In any case, don't class BTC as a surveillance coin, but like I said I think it needs fungability at the very least. It is permissionless, censorship resistant and unconfiscatable. These properties alone are a huge improvement from what we already have."
1709,"I doubt I’d be shocked, disappointed would probably be a better way to describe it. What I’m getting at however is that it honestly can’t be any worse than the current system."
1710,"> but like I said I think it needs fungability at the very least.

You do realize that nothing other than adding privacy by default at the base layer can insure fungibility right?"
