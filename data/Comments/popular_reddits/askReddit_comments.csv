Enjoy."
296,"but ok, realistically, you want to do a few things...  


1) anticipate it.  Think about your orgasm (and however you're *actually* getting there, whether it's with a toy, your own hand, a partner's mouth,face,pussy, whatever).  Think about it all day at work.  Look forward to it.  Have it on your mind.  


2) stretch beforehand.  I don't only mean stretch your dick.  I mean stretch like you would before a run or other workout.  loosen your muscles, extend your legs, touch your toes, raise your arms, all of the warmup stuff.

  
3) Part of what makes it enjoyable is that few moments afterward while you catch your breath and your partner (or hand) does too.  Since you just engaged most of your body's nerve responses, you have a few minutes before any chronic pain sets in again, and muscular aches or whatever start up again, etc.  Be sure before starting that you will not have to immediately jump up to do something else.  Your door is closed, so a pet can't come jump up near the mess or in any other way disturb you, and spend about 5 minutes just kind of feeling the post-nut clarity before your senses come back.  If you have a ceiling fan where you are, it should be on.  cold moving air on your junk enhances this.   If you must get up within those 5 minutes or so, you owe it to yourself to have a cigarette even if you don't normally smoke.

  
4) When you are about to orgasm, lift your legs off whatever surface they are on.  Trust me on this one."
297,Agreed.

299,"I (34m) remember waking up crying at 4 years old because I had a bad dream. My mom (single mother) was not in her room or in the house. I figured she'd be at the neighbor's house since she was good friends with him. 

Walked into the house (country road, no one locked their doors) and heard noise in the bedroom. I walked in, soaked in tears, and saw my mom on top of the guy in the dark. She saw me, got up naked, put a robe on and took me home and put me back to bed.

Starting therapy next week cause it def left some trauma."
300,I took a trip to Canada and kayaked a bunch of lakes for like 60 miles. So beautiful
301,"Dancing for the first time with my then-boyfriend. I was really nervous and don't like to draw attention to myself, but he said he'd never had so much fun."
302,"It‚Äôs pretty depressing, but it was saying goodbye to my best friend before they moved away."
303,"I would say it matters *why.*  If it's something as simple as ""we don't like non-white people,"" then yeah, racist.  If it's something more like, ""we lack the experience and connections to meaningfully answer questions (or find those who can answer questions) this child may have about their identity in terms of their ancestry and culture of their ancestry,"" then that's more reasonable."
304,It's not racist at all. Anyone who thinks this is an idiot.
305,I'm just here for the show
306,I never heard anyone say this before
307,i‚Äôm not sure what this is about - but why would you want white children over other races? if i were to have a child i wouldn‚Äôt give two shits about their skin
308,Interesting strawman you got going there.
309,What?
310,"I don't believe it's racist but I understand why. Even though it's 2020, there is still a hierarchy with races, white being at the top. My cousin told me the reason she wants to have white children and that's because she doesn't want her children to be refused for a job, group, etc. Because of their race. It'll just make it harder for them to grow up."
311,I guess I'm a progressive but that's not what I believe.
312,"What a strange question. 

I think it is natural to want your children to resemble you.

If you are white and your spouse is black/ asian then it might be a little selfish/ ignorant or even racist if you wanted your kid to look 100% white. 

Just depends what is driving the desire."
313,Odds are pretty high that two white people are going to have a white child.
314,why do you want white children?
315,"Yep same, we need popcorn"
316,"Because I prefer European beauty and physical features over non-European appearances, and I feel it is my duty as a white person to preserve European appearances for the future, especially inside Europe."
317,"I'm European and I'm not white. Your perception of ""European beauty"" is flawed because what you mean to say is ""white beauty"""
318,Are you even beautiful yourself tho? Post a pic.
319,why is that your duty? I don‚Äôt necessarily think theres anything wrong with having a preference but i guess i just don‚Äôt understand why you feel the need to preserve that. do you think there is something wrong with white people who dont feel the same?
320,Got the 14 words tucked away in here huh?
321,Got the 14 words tucked away in here huh?
322,"White means European. Whites are the original people of Europe who have indigenous European physical features. Everyone knows what is meant by ""European appearance"". The fact that there are now numerous Africans, Arabs, Asians, Indians etc. in Europe does not change what European appearance means. The fact that there are white Europeans in South Africa does not change the fact that ""sub-Saharan African appearance"" implies dark skin, broad flat noses, big lips, nappy Afro hair, black eyes, prognathist facial bone structure, etc.

What is the point of your comment anyway?"
323,Deep breath and stretch my fingers
324,Ignoring the fast-approaching deadline and failing as it didn't even started.
325,Opening random book from my bookshelf at the random page and reading random sentence from this page as a prediction.
326,I'd probably bring an OP waifu back.
327,Stellaris. I'm sure any tech from Stellaris would have massive game changing technologies for Earth.
328,"Warframe.

If I made a list of all the things I wanted here, it would be a TL;DR"
329,Portal gun!!!
330,"Big daddy, somehow he is cute (Bioshock)"
331,what new font
332,I hate it.
333,I use Reddit is Fun so I am not so sure if it applies to that Subreddit.
334,Sad!
335,"Reddit official app is pretty terrible. 

[I've been using this app for the entire time I've used reddit. Premium version has no ads too. Pretty great.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit)"
336,"Android has a new font today, it's not much different but enough to notice."
337,I‚Äôm afraid not only Android.
338,"Living in 2020, the big future year that everyone was talking about. Why the fuck am I still paying more than 30k for school? Why is it more expensive to have good healthcare than to make payments on a sports car? Why does minimum wage still not even cover basic rent? Why aren't we doing anything about the ice caps melting and weather getting fucking crazy?

The asshole doesn't give a fuck about anyone but the 1% of rich folks. We need someone who does."
339,"I don't spend much energy, but I'm on a lunch break so I'll dive in on this.

SCOTUS appointees. He is making a very conservative SCOTUS. This could effect us for decades. The biggest example currently is the possibility of overturning Roe. And Trump is simultaneously working to defund planned parenthood. This will affect anyone who likes sex, as women lock down more because they can't access legal and safe abortions as a last resort anymore. When I was younger and hitting my GF raw, I thanked anyone who would listen that at the very end of the list of options, we had that goal-line defense. We still used BC, and never had to use it, but imagine how fucked up our lives would be if we had a kid in HS or College? Fuck that. Also, it's kind of fucked up that a bunch of old men are ruling on what women can do with their own bodies. I know if a bunch of old women told me what I could do with my male body, I'd tell them to fuck right off lol. Women have to give up their bodies, their life even, to gestate a baby, they should have the choice to terminate. It really is that simple IMO.

He has eroded alliances on the world stage, and hurt the US's reputation. This one sucks, but honestly, Trump isn't strong enough to kill these relationships. The next president will get an ""easy win"" just by coming into power and being generally more pleasant on his tour abroad. He'll just ""restore"" the faith in the US by being more put together and not talking shit on twitter, and hopefully we'll get back to normal. But if that doesn't happen, the erosion of alliances, especially one like NATO, could cause the US to be in much more danger. NATO is by far the strongest alliance on Earth. It's nigh unbeatable. Russia and China would LOVE to see it splinter, so they can operate with more impunity. NATO protects the US as top dog in the world, because we are the driving force behind it.

Then you have the precedents he is setting with all of his shady actions. He got away with the transgressions that led to impeachment. This means that is now ""acceptable behavior"". The Republicans are going to be really butthurt when a Democratic president does what Trump did and more, because ""hey, it's no big deal! nothing happened!""... In general it's just a corrupt way to run the office of POTUS. I'd rather neither side engage in it, than both sides.

&#x200B;

But in general, he hasn't really ruined my life or anything. He's just a cunt. We'll be done with him soon, either next year or in 4.5 years... But the shit he gets away with today will be the new standard for the next guy, and that's what sucks."

343,Libtard detected. Do facts and logic scare you? Huh?
344,"‚Äúhe can‚Äôt read‚Äù

Yeah sure, ok"
345,"Trump is the fucking *president*... These things can be changed. Trump doesn't set these things because he doesn't care to, he could control pretty much all of them sans climate change with better systems, its just that he doesn't really want to."
346,He‚Äôs got to be a conservative trolling to make liberals look bad. I‚Äôm not buying his comment‚Äôs authenticity
