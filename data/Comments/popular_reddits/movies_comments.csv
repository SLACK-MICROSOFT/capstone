1,"You're referring to closed captions, though whether there are options to just have the dialogue probably depends on what service you're using. I think Netflix usually has both dialogue-only and closed captions available? Not sure about amazon or all that. Blu-rays typically come with multiple subtitle tracks too."
2,Subtitles and closed captioning are two separate things. I think some physical dvds and blu rays allow for subtitles only.
3,Most foreign-language films only subtitle the dialogue. It seems to the the norm rather than the exception.
4,I understand why they’re there and that it really isn’t much of a problem. Was just wondering if their was options.
5,"Right, makes sense. Thanks!"

14,Thanks I'll take a listen!
15,"Letterboxd is a pretty great movie site, although it is pretty light on discussion between members"
16,Letterboxd maybe? Its biggest plus is allowing the users to make lists of movies which I find pretty great.
17,Taste of Cinema maybe? It's probably a given but you never know.
18,"The main attraction of They Shoot Pictures Don't They is their comprehensive megalist of the best movies of all time (and another best of the 21st century list), but they also have director profiles that showcase the classic auteurs and newer acclaimed filmmakers."
19,Love the cast but hate that it is for a David O. Russell film. He is an awful human being.
20,Holy hell. This cast is shaping up to be great. Lots of Oscar nominations incoming if the movie delivers.
21,"[One particularly disturbing story comes courtesy of Russell’s niece (not a blood relative), who filed a police report in 2011 alleging that the actor groped her. According to police reports, the then 19-year-old, who is transgender, was discussing hormones with Russell, after which he “put his hands under [her] top and felt both breasts.” During this same visit to a Florida gym, Russell also allegedly offered to help his niece with ab exercises as his hand “hovered above” her “private parts.” While Russell did not face any charges and the case was ultimately closed, the director himself confirmed the incident, attempting to justify his actions by telling the police that she was “acting very provocative toward him,” and that he was “curious about the breast enhancement.” According to a police report, “Russell stated she is always causing drama since the transgender transformation and has become very provocative and seductive.”](https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywood-terror-director-david-o-russells-history-of-groping-and-on-set-abuse)"
22,"> Plot details are being kept under wraps on the movie, which will be Russell's return to the director's seat for the first time since 2015's Joy, starring Jennifer Lawrence.

Jamie Foxx & Angelina Jolie are also rumored. This is gonna be an insanely stacked cast and instant awards player."
23,The casting along makes me want to watch thus movie.
24,Is that Steve Harvey?
25,MBJ needs a great director to tap into his talents. His Non-Coogler stuff hasnt been amazing - heres hoping this is a great role for him!
26,Where's Jennifer Lawrence?
27,"Surprised Bale’s back in after all those reported shouting matches, hopefully Russell has changed his ways. 

Or the allure of easy awards season recognition is too much to pass up"
28,I think Michael B Jordan's role is the one that Foxx was under consideration for
29,Or instant bait.
30,She is free from David O Russell she's her own things.
31,Looks like she passed on the role that went to Robbie.
32,I doubt people like Bale or Lawrence are fazed by Russell's shouting. They're too strong to let him bully them and if they didn't enjoy working with him they wouldn't go back. At this point I think every actor knows what they're getting themselves into by working with Russell.
33,Prob the latter.
34,"I don’t know much about Russell, is he famous for being an asshole on set? I heard Bale and J-Law got into it with him at one point, but I never knew about what, or even much about him."
35,Here is a good article about him: [https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywood-terror-director-david-o-russells-history-of-groping-and-on-set-abuse](https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywood-terror-director-david-o-russells-history-of-groping-and-on-set-abuse)
36,Nominees usually select which category they want to be considered for.
37,The individual chooses which category they get nominated for.
38,What's a non binary person?
39,"If I were nonbinary, I'd go with ""best actor"" because ""actor"" doesn't necessarily always imply maleness, right? But not being NB I can't speak on it with any degree of authority obviously, it could very well be a trigger for dysphoria that I can never understand."
40,"You’re assuming that Hollywood is unbiased enough to actually give a leading or great supporting role to an openly non-binary person and nominate them for an award.

But if it does happen, I think it would be like the leading/supporting categories (often unclear if a role is one or the other) and the actor/studio would choose the category where they’re more likely to win."
41,Someone who doesn’t identify as male or female.
42,"He had been building resentment towards Park from seeing how he treated people and heard what they said about his smell. The day of the party he was already visibly upset and dissociating, and after he watched his daughter get stabbed he was in a state of shock. When Mr. Park was trying to get his son to the hospital but had to get the keys and was visibly grossed out at the sight/smell it triggered all those pent up feelings in Kim and he just snapped. It was a knee-jerk reaction from a man that had been made to feel lesser than from his upper class employers and was in a state of shock after seeing his daughter stabbed. Even he can't believe he did it afterwards but got caught up in the heat of the moment.

>it wasn't his intention to ignore the fact that Kim's daughter was dying?

He didn't even know that was his daughter so that's not really a factor I don't think. If anything he was probably confused as to why he was helping her and not him."
43,"Maybe this video essay could help.

https://youtu.be/ci-gFovSJf0"
44,"Ah I see. I feel really bad for Mr Park, he was a jerk but didn't deserve to die."
45,"The podcast was very well produced and acted. The premise was pretty interesting too, but it really didn't do much for me looking back. Maybe it was the medium and it will be a lot more gripping as a movie. I hope this works out well."
46,"J Edgar had hideously bad old age makeup. Leonardo was trying his best to make it work, but the makeup was so awful, some of the serious emotional scenes came off like comedy."
47,"Idk chris evan in endgame was pretty flawless, I thought it was an old actor"
48,Best: Mrs Doubtfire (1993)
49,"Unless a notably unforgivable example should arise in any of these replies, I can't really think of any. I've never found my enjoyment contingent on ""realness"" as far as effects go. 

If something looks fake I'll likely still get a kick out of it anyway, my standards really aren't that unappeasable. And if I don't, usually there's some pro outweighing the con, like the actor's heart is really in it or what have you."
50,I thought Vice did a pretty good job making Christian Bale look like Dick Cheney.
51,">""looked so awful to you it distracts you from the story""

Channing Tatum's prosthetic ears in Jupiter Ascending (2015) were funny.

Guy Pearce in Prometheus (2012).

>""Equally, when were the prosthetics that good?""

I watched The Fly (1986) for the first time just a couple of years ago and boy was I blown away by the prostetics and the makeup.

I didn't recognize Nicole Kidman in The Hours (2002). And I don't mean that it took me a while to recognize her - I finished the movie without a clue.

Guillermo del Toro's films, Hellboy: The Golden Army (2008), Pan's Labyrinth (2006), The Shape of Water (2017).

Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder (2008).

Fat Thor in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Also MCU: Nebula look.

Heath Ledger's scars from The Dark Knight (2008) count as prostetics?"
52,IT 2. Graphics of the non IT monsters (e.g the homeless leper) were terrible. Totally ruined the film for me. I also realise this isn’t prosthetics but it’s terrible graphics.
53,"Worst: Danny De Vito's Penguin costume in Batman Returns (1992). He looked like he was wearing something between an inflatable beach ball and a fatsuit. It was only years later that I learned the costume was supposed to make him look hunched over, like penguins do when they are incubating their eggs. Also, his rubber flipper fingers looked like ... well, rubber flipper fingers, and wobbled around very unconvincingly whenever he did anything. There was no attempt at any serious articulation."
54,It still qualifies about the graphics.
55,"As someone who is both young and didn’t grow up in an English-speaking country, this film proved to me that we do need new adaptations of classic stories once for every new generation.

I’d never heard of Little Women and I would’ve probably never seen any version of the story it if it wasn’t for Greta Gerwig."
56,"My favorite bit of /r/MovieDetails trivia about Gerwig's *Little Women* (2019)?

The piano pieces that [Beth plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqIbgxiIknY) in the childhood flashback are '*Papillons, Op. 2*' and '*Kinderszenen*' from Schumann: the first is meant to represent the [fluttering movements at a ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSUCLUniinA&feature=youtu.be&t=531) (like the one that Meg attends in the next scene), while the second is German for '[scenes from a childhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibf6QNjgGU)'.

...This movie outperforming its estimations in the international box office is encouraging and well deserved"
57,"between this scene at the end where he slams his face on the bench and the scene in Liar, Liar where he smushes his face with the toilet seat, I don't think there's an actor who quite brings exactly the same amount of energy and desire to make you laugh as Jim Carrey.

Over-acting? Sure. But at least it leads to memorable work."
58,I love that movie!
59,"I know, a lot of people were pretty pissed off when the film released cuz there were a lot of artistic liberties.
And we all know just how well Tom Hooper can adapt from source material XD"
60,"I mean, it's Tom Hooper."
61,Im ready for a Rick Moranissance.
62,"It's interesting that this brought him out, not the Ghostbusters offer. I wonder if he felt the script was better or what. In any case, I've really missed Rick and I hope he has a great time on set."
63,"Guess his kids finally grew up, yay!"
64,"> I understand the movie will be made for the theatrical side, not Disney+.

This is huge. His first movie in 24 years and it's getting a theatrical release too. Tought this movie would go straight to Disney+. 

> The movie centers around Gad’s character who is the son of Moranis’ Wayne Szalinski. Son in aspiring to be a great scientist like his father, accidentally shrinks the kids.

Probably going to be a small role since it's centered around Josh Gad's character but good to see he's now in a place where he's fine with coming back to movies after his wife's death."
65,"Good for Rick, I had serious doubts he would ever do live acting ever again. I'm really happy he's back."
66,Honey I shrunk the great grandkids
67,"Cool that he came back for this film,However, Rick, My man, PLESSE accept Mel's offer for Spaceballs 3:The Search for Spaceball 2:The Search for more money before he dies.

We need that film more then ever!

Also a Doug and Bob Reunion would be nice too"
68,"No one can resist Disney's urge to produce a sequel. Not even Moranis.

Hope he gets good money tho, he deserves it. Seems like a good person."
69,I'm still waiting for that SCTV documentary that was filmed like 2 years ago with Scorsese.
70,"Hollywood is running out ideas. (let Jordan Peele, Rian Johnson and Christopher Nolan do whatever they want)"
71,I can't be the only one dreading this. Leave Rick Moranis alone!
72,"Note: this is not for a Disney+ series, but instead will be a theatrical film that will most certainly stream on Disney+ eventually."
73,Nostalgia and late sequels are slowly ruining all franchises...
74,I'm really surprised that this will be for theatrical release and not just a Disney+ movie. Very excited for this.
75,More fucking sequels. Fuck of Disney. You're running Cinema.
76,Let the Moranissance begin!
77,Righteous
78,"We had the Joe Pescinaissance recently, time for a new one."
79,I'm always ready for moreanus
80,"Disney has deeper pockets than Sony.

but more seriously though, maybe this role is more significant. I'd bet the Ghostbusters role would have been a tiny cameo."
81,It could just be that he had more fun with the Shrunk series? I imagine he’s wealthy enough that he doesn’t have to to anything unless he wants to.
82,"I thought the same thing, it could not have been the money bc I’m sure ghostbusters was willing to offer him gobs of money. Maybe, I’m just speculating, his kids are a little more grown now? He feels comfortable to be able to commit his time. In any case he’s a great guy and a role model."
83,"This is a more iconic role for him, in the sense that he wasn’t supporting a handful of other comedy all-stars like he was in Ghostbusters. If he’s gonna come back, this makes most sense."
84,He retired in 1997 to take care of his kids so they're probably near 30 now.
85,"> Josh Gad

I don't now how I feel about this"
86,"Cash them checks, Rick."
87,I feel like that kind of family movie in theaters doesn't really exist anymore. Once kids are past animated films they go to superhero movies. There's no in between
88,Reganomics!
89,Can't leave out the Matthew McConaughaissance.
90,who else deserves an aissance^? ?
91,Aw hell do we need to worry about grandkids?! Is a Louis Tully: Keymaster movie never gonna happen??
92,"He was pretty hilarious in *Little Monsters* last year but yeah the rest of his output is uhhhh, a mixed bag."
93,I feel great. He was amazing in book of Mormon.
94,I think he's sort of like Kevin Hart in that he's pretty funny when he doesn't have to carry a movie by himself
95,Way too much hate for that guy on this sub.
96,"Josh Gad always surprises me with how naturally hilarious he is tbh, I'll be excited to see what he does with the role. If you've never seen his Wired interview with Jonathon Groff I recommend it, the dude is a riot."
97,He was great in Wedding Ringer and Pixels
98,I completely agree. My first thought was how excited I am going to be to take my kids to see this.

102,I’m enjoying him in Avenue 5 on HBO
103,"He was fucking hilarious in Little Monsters, every time he was on screen I was cracking up.



A very fun film overall."
104,"I feel like he's very often let down by bad scripts or bad directing, he always goes hard in his acting.

I like him."
105,I do like his work in his supporting roles
106,But those are the same people.
107,Braff is on some drama show my wife watches.
108,Yup
109,Why only Americans suffer this problem?
110,"I prefer subtitles, because even though i can't understand what they're saying, you lose the actors emotional performance when its overdubbed."
111,"I normally avoid subtitles, but I did watch and really enjoyed Parasite and City of God. 

The main reason being that there are already plenty of English movies I still want/need to see, but I don’t immediately say no to subtitles if a movie comes up that seems interesting."
112,###TOP 10 GREATEST ANIME DEBATES OF ALL TIME
113,"If subtitles are too much of a hassle to enjoy a film, you are lazy. I cannot believe that the viewer is stupid because it is not difficult to read. It has to be pure laziness."
114,"Only certain movies.  Anime I prefer dubbed, Asian action only sometimes but dramas I can deal with.  The real barrier is the genre."
115,"I don't mind subs at all. However, I have to have seen the movie a few times in order to not miss anything. If I'm reading subs, it's hard to concentrate on what's happening in the movie.

I have the same problem when reading a book. Everything starts to kinda blur together in my mind and I have to read paragraphs 2 or 3 times to understand what's happening. A couple pages later and my mind wanders. Give me an audio book and I LOVE it though. I'll get hooked on a book to the point I just want to sit on the couch or lie in bed and listen."
116,"As a high school teacher, I can tell you, many of my students, if not most of my students, cannot read well enough and fast enough to watch a movie with subtitles."
117,*After Obamas Win Is Racism Still A Problem for Americans?*
118,"Yes, and they always will be. This is not going to make any difference. Sadly. It's similar with music."
119,"Yes, most Americans didn't see Parasite."
120,"Because if you live in a state like Ohio, you'd need to drive like 15 hours to get to a place where they don't speak English. There are so many different languages in a place like Europe that you're used to things being in other languages"
121,"I'm exactly the opposite, probably because I'm a slightly slow reader.  If I'm spending most of my time reading the subtitles, I'm missing out on the actors' physical portrayal/body language.  I'd rather have decent dubs than subtitles.  I will say that bad dubs can ruin it though, too."
122,"Some people have learning disabilities, vision impairments, or are just slow readers.  Just because subtitles aren't a problem for you doesn't mean there's no way they could be for others."
123,I live in Ohio... you don't have to go very far to hear other languages lol. I'm guessing you've never been to Columbus?
124,"WTF are you talking about, each country have their own language, its not like all people talk 5 different languages in 1 country.  
If you go to another country, then yes, there is another language."
125,I meant a place where the majority of people speak other another language to the point where they would be producing movies/TV with subtitles. Obviously people all over the US speak other languages but that isn't what I meant in regard to the point about subtitles.
126,It's much harder to go to another country in America than it is in most European countries. Although I don't doubt countries like Australia and Canada have similar issues.
127,I mean if you live in Spain it's pretty easy to drive to France for a weekend or something. You can't really do that in the US
128,"I think their point is that America is such a large place that is very prohibitive for a lot of citizens to ever leave the country and have a reason to be exposed to a different language.  Sure, Spanish is probably pretty prevalent in the south west, but that still leaves a lot of the country that doesn't have that exposure.

However, in Europe for example, they go between different countries with different languages much like we go state to state over here, because they are much smaller and in closer proximity."
129,"The problem with that kind of post is that you can’t recommend something as “a film with a twist” without ruining the experience of the twist.

The best twist is the one you didn’t expect."
130,I don't know if i can call it a twist. But watch knives out. Parasite has a brilliant turn.
131,"Try memento, 7 deadly sins, and the usual suspects. Great twists on these films."
132,Maybe Pimer or The box.
133,Juwanna Mann
134,Grease has a fair amount of twisting.
135,"There are a lot of great movies that fit the description you're looking for, and I'm sure you'll get some excellent suggestions here. I just want to caution using this method to find such movies, since knowing that a movie has a twist ending is a spoiler of its own. The best twists are the ones you never see coming. And even if you don't guess the right twist, just knowing that one is coming can dampen the effect."
136,The Prodigy

157,You have been told to shut up.
158,"This was the 1993 version starring Thomas Kretschmann, really good movie."
159,I agree. I thought he captured the german perspective of the battle really well.
160,"My suggestion is to watch his movies in order of release. So start with '**Bottle Rocket**' and eventually make your way to '**Isle of Dogs**'.

The reason why I suggest this is so that you can literally see him evolve as a filmmaker and see his style progressively get more refined.

It makes you appreciate how far he's come from his early days, to now."
161,Yes have drinks or snacks and strap in
162,"Nah don’t overthink it. Watch it in the order they were released if you want, or backwards, or random. Doesn’t matter. All the stories are separate, no connections other than using a lot of the same actors (Bill Murray being the most prominent). Just realize his first film, Bottle Rocket, is the least like his familiar style, though still a great film in my opinion (and featuring a very young Luke and Owen Wilson). Just don’t be turned off by it is all I’m saying. His second film, Rushmore, jumps right into that style and he never turns back. And don’t forget to watch some of his short films/commercials, they are pretty entertaining."
163,"I think that there isn't really an answer to your question. If you were to ask Anderson he'd say it's just a story and hopes you enjoy it.

He has a unique aesthetic that you either enjoy or don't. Not all of his movie's are as intense with that aesthetic. Most feel like storybooks, in fact a few of them are stories within stories. I'm not sure there's a watching order as they aren't connected. They get bigger as he goes really and each one implements something new. I would say that the French Dispatch seems closer in concept to The Grand Budapest Hotel more so than his other works."
164,"Sit symmetrically centered in front of the TV. 

 No but in all seriousness, just watch them and enjoy. No tricks or tips needed. The distinctive cinematography and production design will make themselves evident. 

If you want to watch the natural progression of his style, I suggest staring from the beginning of his filmography but you don’t really have to."
165,"Ohhhh. I’m a serious fan of his films. My space in my home has a lot of posters from his films and fan art and those funko vinyl figures. I’m currently working on framing more posters. 
The book about his films is hugely informative and gives a lot of information about inspirations for the films and the painstaking work of the intricate sets. 

What he is famous for is shooting in symmetry,
tracking shots. If you watch even clips from his films you’ll quickly catch onto this. 

Beautiful color palettes are another of his famous “trademarks.” Each film has a color theme to them. 

He has recurring actors on his films as well. Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and a few others are regular players in his films. 

What I love about his films in addition to the absolute eye candy and wonderful acting is that the stories have layers. Each character has their own story that comes together to create the whole film. They can be quirky and silly with a love story or a sad story. 

Wes is wildly creative and skilled. While it angers a lot of his fans that he’s not won an Oscar, I personally feel that’s ok. His films aren’t mainstream and that’s alright. 
I’d suggest you watch “Life Aquatic” and “ Moonrise Kingdom”. Those have been wildly popular and I think more obvious comedy. 

I could talk about his films all day lol"
166,Take mushrooms
167,"No need to watch Bottle Rocket. If you want to start with a good beginning, Rushmore is good. But Wes wasn't completely filled out until Tenenbaums."
168,"Yeah get stoned before watching it. You’ll really appreciate the vibrant colors and creative cinematography. Wes Anderson is a wonderful director and his films are very pleasant to watch, especially after a bowl. Enjoy the movie, Hope this helps!"
169,But her mom was also more concerned with being the cool mom rather than giving her daughter some direction. And a drug addict trying to get better is still a drug addict. They weren't good parents.
170,"You seem to be projecting a lot here about 'victimization'. You're forgetting that she was a child, had no father figure and had a mother that was more concerned with being a cool friend than a real parent and brought drug addicts around her children. Teenagers without solid family foundations lash out, it just happens.

If you have a hard time sympathizing then I think that says more about you particularly then it does the movie. Characters don't have to be perfect or blame free to be sympathizable, especially when they're children from broken homes. Almost seems like you have personal experience with someone like this and maybe that's causing it."
171,My first thought is either Jennifer Lawrence or River Phoenix.
172,Evangeline Lilly maybe?
173,River Phoenix died in 1993... but it looks a lot like him.
174,Maybe Jennifer Lawrence
175,Kate Beckinsale frequently puts her hair behind one ear like that.
176,That chick from Star Wars.
177,>River Phoenix - that was my first thought.
178,What do you think happened? That's exactly the point.
179,"He later murdered an unarmed woman and two kids. And the unarmed cartel boss. As well as several unarmed cartel stooges. He also let someone almost get strangled to death. And threatened to kill her outright if she talked too much

Raping the prisoner is absolutely not outside of his normal operating parameters"
180,Showed him Cats
181,I thought he used the water container to crush his balls
182,"I have no idea that's why I was asking. It sounded like rape but I can't imagine that the character Alejandro would have done this. That's too weird. 

I thought the director would have revealed it maybe."
183,"That was because he seeked revenge. The cartel boss has killed his family.   
I could imagine him raping him with an object but nothing else.

And what did he bring the 20 l water bottle for? To distact the other agents so they would think he would ""just"" torture him with water (which would be totally ok) but not with his penis (because that would be a human rights violation)?"
184,"Cartel boss and unarmed doesn't matter, the boss usually tell the stooges who to kill. Rarely do they themselves partake in it to claim innocence if the stooge is caught"
185,"No, he haven't. But the goal was to make us imagine the horrible things."
186,Sometimes a director films it like that on purpose so the viewer uses his imagination to picture the horrible things being done. It can be a very effective technique.
187,"Psychologically, the prisoner was freaking out about being water-boarded. That's an extremely tough torture to suffer through. Then, last minute, he puts the water down and your mind just 'breaks' trying to figure out what could be worse than being waterboarded, something that's about to happen in a minute or two.

Psychological torture, turned up to 11"
188,"I get that. 

It just goes to show how resolute and cold he is- it's one thing shooting a guy in the face as he reaches for his gun. It's completely different to shoot his 6 year old daughter, 5 year old son and his unarmed wife just to see him break right before you pop him in the head"
189,"TLDR: ~~Th4r is in reshoots~~ he has no current plans for a Star Wars movie

Edit: Taika is not opposed to reshoots and uses them on all of his movies"
190,MCU movies all have reshoots in their schedules incase they need something after principal photography has finished.
191,Strange how Thor 4 is already in reshoots when it hadn’t even entered principal photography
192,"He was talking about Thor Ragnarok, Th4r hasn't even begun shooting yet"
193,"> Th4r is in reshoots 

No its not. It hasnt even been written."
194,And wasn’t just recently that they hired a writer?
195,"Ah thanks, I misread that"
196,Taika had written a script and a few days ago they hired some else to screenwrite too
197,"I love The Lost Boys ost. It's so 80's, I just can't cope with how amazing it is."
198,"Social Network, Moonlight, Her, Hans Zimmer’s Dark Phoenix

And Tv: Leftovers. Leftovers. Leftovers."
199,"I like the devil's rejects soundtrack for the most part, it's got a lot of classic rock"
200,I love Joe Hisaishi’s works and his soundtrack for Kitano’s “Kids return” is probably one of my “most listened” albums
201,T2
202,I like listening to John Murphy’s work. Especially his music from the *28* films.
203,"Drive, The Royal Tenenbaums, A Single Man, any soundtrack by Hans Zimmer or Jon Brion, Blue Valentine, The Master, An Education, Django Unchained."
204,"Last Action Hero

Judgement Night"
205,"The Conan the Barbarian soundtrack by Basil Poledouris because it's just such a rousing score, it really gets my juices going."
206,"The Harder They Come

Great reggae tracks, some twice 

(~};-}"
207,"The Good, the Bad and the ugly maybe. L'estasi dell'oro and Il Triello in particular are so epic and cool to listen even by themselves without the movie."
208,Angus soundtrack because it was stuck in my car's CD player for 4 years....and I didn't mind.
209,The original Bladerunner soundtrack is fantastic.
210,"The Lord of the Rings soundtracks. 

Howard Shore is a god damned genius and I love the music."
211,Reservoir dogs * Kbilly's swinging sounds of the seventies* an excellent narriated soundtrack to drive to.
212,Frozen II. I cant stop.
213,"Inception, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.  Outside of way too many John Williams scores I listen to these all time.  The later I used to listen to when I was mourning. I can’t remember how many times I listened to On Thin Ice during that period."
214,Swiss army man
215,"I listen to the Broadchurch soundtrack and gloomy breezy days.


I listen to the Sunshine soundtrack when waiting at the Starbucks drive thru. Makes the build up to getting my coffee seem more grand."
216,"All of Star Wars, for the fun of it. John Williams music really is a treasure. And for that matter, John Powell did some very dynamic work, and while not impressive Michael Giacchino was solid on RO."
217,One of the best soundtracks ever
218,Probably an unpopular opinion but Tarantino’s movies have went downhill without Sally’s editing.
219,lots of people say that
220,Editing is so often  overlooked as to just how important it is. There are so many movies that with a different editor would simply not have been anything like what they were. I think you correct in your assertion as well. She had an amazing ability.
221,"Dude, everyone says that."
222,"I would definitely agree with that, although Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is the first Tarantino movie I thoroughly enjoyed since Inglourious Basterds. I thought Django Unchained and Hateful Eight were just too overlong and indulgent. OUATIH is somewhat overlong and indulgent in its own way, but I feel like that kind of suits the story because it's about people trying to hold onto the romanticized idea of Hollywood as long as they can before it goes away. There are scenes that definitely feel like they could be cut out or trimmed down to pick up the pace, but there were never any scenes where I felt like I was waiting for them to ""just get on with it"" like I felt when I watched Django Unchained and Hateful Eight. Those movies were more about plot, so it was frustrating to feel like the pace had been bogged down with unnecessarily long, drawn-out scenes. But OUATIH seems less interested in the plot, and more interested in being a snapshot of a time and place, with more emphasis on how the characters fit into that setting."
223,I like this trend of adapting podcasts into movies.
224,I stop and watch about an hour of *O Brother Where Art Thou* nearly every time I see it on TV.
225,"Aliens, Hot Fuzz, any Tarantino film."
226,"Just because I'm such a sucker for them, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I watch it probably once every year or six months. But outside of that, I would have to give it to Mad Max: Fury Road. Not particularly amazing to a lot of people but the movie is just so much fun."
227,The Social Network. Watch it every 4/6 months
228,"Sideways

O Brother Where Art Thou?

Goodfellas"
229,I never get tired of Kung Fu Hustle
230,Physically impossible for me to not watch The Dark Knight when it comes on. It’s a sickness.

all the movies I've watched 4 or more times."
232,The Matrix and Chungking Express
233,Pulp Fiction and The Princess Bride! And Apocalypse Now!
234,OG Star Wars trilogy
235,*Raiders of the Lost Ark* as I've pretty much lost track of how many times I've sat down to watch this film.
236,Scott Pilgrim vs the World is the obvious choice!
237,"I've been rewatching Moana, Captain Marvel, Thor: Ragnarok, and Black Panther a lot the past several months. I've watched The Emperor's New Groove probably a hundred times. Back when I still had cable and no streaming services I'd drop whatever I was watching if I saw Winter Soldier on FX.

I guess I'm Disney's bitch."
238,Edge of Tomorrow. I just love everything about that movie.
239,"Her, Apocalypse Now, Meet the Parents, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, LOTR Extended Edition"
240,"Anchorman, but i burnt out after watching it a million times in 7 years"
241,Edgar Wright’s filmography. There’s always new stuff I pick up.
242,The dark Knight. I have watched it once a week for 1 year. I just can't stop watching it.
243,"Pre-Disney Star Wars, The Godfather, The Dark Knight and any Tarantino."
244,"The Big Short, Kingdom of Heaven and Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

Last Samurai is a great choice too, props OP."
245,I have seen Kill Bill 1 and 2 more than any movie.  Second place is Dredd.
246,"Skyfall, Gone In 60 Seconds (2000).

&#x200B;

When Skyfall was on Netflix I had it on in the background almost all day and never got tired of it."
247,"For me movies ive rewatched the most over the years include casino, goodfellas, heat, die hard, terminator 2, halloween (1978), pulp fiction, saving private ryan, the matrix and superbad"
248,One of the movies that I can watch over and over again is the original ghostbusters movie. I find it so funny. It’s one that I can quote the whole thing.
249,"It would be a comedy, for years I put them on as I went to bed. My go to's were old WC Fields or Marx Bros movies - settling down for the night with an old friend and a chuckle was nice, I felt like I noticed another gem comedy bit every rewatch.


It was *such* a big deal when their films were finally released on DVD (with old movies it seemed like there was always a couple decades or so worth of squabbles over film rights that had to be decided before they were released) and I didn't have to throw in an old VHS tape of The Bank Dick or Monkey Business..that usually featured a lovely, but well worn, introduction from Tom Hatten on his wonderful Family Film Festival show."
250,"I feel like some girly trash needs to be added, so i nominate Pretty Woman, The Devil Wears Prada, and Mamma Mia (I saw that crap 3 times in the cinema, and countless times on the DVD). Good rom-coms with brilliant actors are underrated."
251,"I think I’ve watched Takahata’s “Only yesterday” at least 15 times in the last 4/5 years, so I’d go with that

Another movie I’ve been rewatching a lot lately is Jeffrey Lau’s “A Chinese odyssey”, it’s quite long (it’s divided in 2parts, 3 hours in total), but i love it

Finally Swordsman 1&2, I’ve discovered them just a couple of years ago (they were unavailable where I live), but since then I’ve been rewatching them at least once every 2/3 months"
252,J.J. Star Wars. Love the fast pace.
253,"Dazed and Confused. I didn't grow up in the 70s, but there's something about that movie that immerses me. Highly recommend the Criterion Blu-ray if you like collecting those."
254,"Interstellar or Blade Runner 2049. Watched both of them probably 50 times each, and Interstellar was about 7 times in Theaters."
255,"Thief (1981),

Margin Call (really can't tell you what makes this so rewatchable),

Carlito's Way,

The Yakuza (1974),

Drive"
256,"Oceans Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen - easy every couple of months for me."
257,"Jurassic Park or Jaws. I've seen them both so many times and I enjoy it every time. Definitely worth buying on Blu-ray/4K.

Edit: also 2001 a space odyssey. I think that's the only movie that actually gets better every time you watch it."
258,"2001: A Space Odyssey

Kill Bill"
259,My guilty pleasure is Thor: Ragnarok. I can watch it almost weekly. Or Spider-Man:into the spiderverse. Im not even a big marvel person but the self awareness and irreverence both movies offer makes them stay fresh and absurd every time. Like. Whoever is in them is enjoying it as much as me it seems.
260,Brendan Fraser’s The Mummy!
261,"Good Time, Collateral, In Bruges, After Hours, Inside Llewyn Davis, Truman Show, Whiplash. Basically films that don’t have a central plot and constantly changes throughout. These films won’t necessarily rank in my top films of all time but they have a bit of everything and are just a joy to watch."
262,I rewatch There Will Be Blood every other month.
263,Everything I know about wine I learned from Sideways.  Great movie!
264,"I watch with chinese voices and subtitles but yeah, this scene gets me every time lol 

https://youtu.be/oCQDycs2G3o

Great film."
265,The Dark Knight is my favorite of the trilogy. Such a great film. Has my favorite joker too.
266,"I feel like generally holiday movies get overlooked often for these types of questions. When I saw the question my mind went to movies I’ve seen many times like Superbad, but I keep forgetting that every holiday I’ll watch Elf, Home alone, or some other Christmas movie. Add that up over many years and it ends up being watched more than many other films."
267,Nice. I watch The Matrix trilogy every now and again. I’m looking forward to buying it eventually in 4k resolution.
268,Solid choices
269,What are your favorite MCU films?
270,Thank you. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is one my favorite comedies.
271,Kill Bill 1 & 2 are awesome. Dredd is one of my favorite movies. So fuc***** good. I’ve seen that many times as well.
272,Guessing you have a secondary viewing device for The Office?
273,"Love Devil Wears Prada, and I feel your list needs Mean Girls. I can practically quote the entire movie."
274,I also love that movie
275,Fury Road made the Road Warrior obsolete.Which i hate because i love the Road Warrior. But everything it did Fury Road did bigger and better
276,"I can't think of anything specific examples, but its probably movies that come from the middle tier of the genre.

Generally I find if you watch the first examples, their often better (or at least different) compared to what the genre became, simply cause the one's that came later often only incorporated and built upon the most obvious elements.

Say for example the original Godzilla is a beautiful and still shocking to this day story of a powerful modern nation feeling helpless in the face of a seeming unstoppable disaster that is partially their own creation.

Meanwhile later one's are just epic giant monster movies, where the plot can get a bit predictable."
277,"I don't think you can really compare the Bourne & Wick movies.

But Spectre was a flat out downgrade from MI: Rogue Nation."
278,"This one took me awhile to come to terms with but 

Old School/Animal House

Edit:
I mean Old school is better than animal house"
279,Wow.  Strongly disagree.  They’re not really comparable either.  Like at all.
280,Agreed. The Bourne movies have decent story but boring action.
281,"I'm going to be downvoted for this, but I think *Enter the Dragon* (1973) feels mighty aged, considering all the other martial arts movies that have topped it in terms of choreography, stunts, etc. Sure, Bruce Lee may have been first (for the most part) and been the best overall martial artist to hit the big screen, but give me the likes of *Police Story* (1985) any day."
282,The Empire Strikes Back
283,"Bigger, yes, but I still prefer Road Warrior. Not that Fury Road isn't excellent; Road Warrior is just that good."
284,"Yeah, which is why I still enjoy the 1st Mission: Impossible and The Bourne Identity. The sequels are great (maybe except M:i-2 and Bourne 4) but they felt more formulaic and each installment just seemed bigger and louder than the previous one (though that's not necessarily a bad thing)."
285,Agree 100% on the Bourne movies. Wick isnt the same type of action flick.
286,Spectre was a downgrade even from the preceeding Bond films.
287,Why? I don't know much about those movies. Did better comedies come out after them?
288,"I had grown up knowing Animal House was one of the funniest movies ever, and never got around to seeing it. Finally did in college and laughed maybe once the entire movie. Mind you, I'm a big fan of John Belushi with Blues Brothers being one of my all time favorite comedies. And just that generation of SNL is fantastic to me. Animal House however just felt very dated. I'll rewatch  movies like Blues Brothers, Ghostbusters, Vacation, Caddyshack, Stripes, etc until the day I die. Probably will never watch Animal House again.

Hell though, even Vacation is pretty dated too. But I find a novelty in that movie given that it spawned a series and (for better or worse) it has a lot of memorable scenes and lines."
289,"They're action movies, why are they not comparable? It's not like I'm comparing Marriage Story to Fast & Furious or some kind of oddball comparison like that."
290,"I remember reviews at the time praised the action and camera work. Like, I get that it takes a certain skill to deliver shaky-cam in an *effective* way, and not just do it for the sake of looking cool. It's what separates the Bourne sequels from the Taken sequels. Shaky does not have to also mean choppy. I think film makers saw that and just shook the camera around during fight scenes and didn't realize that the way Greengrass did it was through the choreography of the fight, timing of hits, and editing it carefully to make it feel like you were the one either in combat, running, or driving away from something.

But at the end of the day, it's still a style I'd prefer not to see. I enjoy action movies more when I see exactly what's happening. Though, with Bourne it was still effective at least in the sense of his character. Everything feels jumbled and confusing because that's exactly how his character feels throughout the series."
291,Huh. This continues to be the best movie in the entire franchise.
292,"No. I mean that Old School is better than Animal House. Just in general as a college frat movie. 

I mean animal house paves the way and is still hilarious. Its just... Oof.  Idk i watched it recently and old school just makes me laugh harder (now)."
293,"Bourne Trilogy is more than an action movie.  It’s an action thriller with spy/mystery elements.  You could compare these films to say The Bond franchise or perhaps the Mission Impossible franchise.  Though both of those rely more on action than plot.  The Bourne movies are a bit more sophisticated in plot and character.  

It’s not easy to compare any action movie to another.  I wouldn’t be able to compare The Matrix to Jurassic Park."
294,There was never a point where it was.
295,What's the best for you?
296,Star Wars.
297,The first one?
298,They are going to be very true to the original. It will be a side scroller.
299,"[Mortal Kombat Reboot Wraps](https://movieweb.com/mortal-kombat-2020-wraps-production/)


“Simon McQuoid was brought on to direct the Mortal Kombat reboot and is making his feature-length debut. The cast includes Joe Taslim (Sub-Zero), Hiroyuki Sanada (Scorpion), Chin Han (Shang Tsung), Ludi Lin (Liu Kang), Jessica McNamee (Sonya Blade), Josh Lawson (Kano), Tadanobu Asano (Raiden), Mehcad Brooks (Jax), Sisi Stringer (Mileena), and Lewis Tan in the mysterious lead role. As for what the movie will be about, that is being kept under wraps for the time being”

The article also mentions James Wan producing. 

I’m not sure how much influence the new games will have plot wise, the two newest games involve a bunch of characters children, and the need to establish the main characters before getting to them. However, visual and tone will be more brutal like the games as its supposed to be rated R."
300,"The one being directed by James Wan, is supposed to be R -Rated"
301,It's not him but a new director called Simon McQuoid from a commercials background. James Wan is producing so I'm hopeful.
302,what a legend. and he seems like such a genuine guy too
303,"he needs to work with Scorsese again!

and its surprising he hasn’t been in any Tarantino yet"
304,based Dafoe
305,His best collaborations are definitely with Abel Ferrara and Paul Schrader.
306,What about Lars Von Trier?
307,"That was a very fascinating interview, but big oof on the end there - Willem Dafoe was not happy about that question. I wonder if that reporter kicks himself about that.

> **AVC**: Playing Vincent Van Gogh, the character was much younger than you were when you were playing the role. Did that factor into your characterization at all?
> 
> **WD**: I guess nobody gave you the bulletin, huh?
> 
> **AVC**: I guess not—what do you mean?  
> 
> **WD**: Ah, you didn’t get the memo! I think that thing about age is bullshit. Yeah, Van Gogh was 37 years old when he died, but he was not a young man, first of all. Mortality in the time he died was different, their 40 was our 75.
> 
> **AVC**: You know, that’s a great point.
> 
> **WD**: This was not a young man. And he had a lot of physical problems. He was an alcoholic, and he was pretty beat up. So I may be older than him by numbers, but I never gave age a single thought. Plus, you have to think about this: He was a man that really lived life. A 37-year-old man now is not having the same kind of experience.
> 
> I don’t know. I never gave a thought, and I found it piddly and beside the point when people would discuss that issue. Watch the movie—nobody should be thinking about age. I think it’s a beautiful movie. And if you’re thinking about that, you’re a moron, what can I say? Not you personally, of course.
> 
> **AVC**: [Laughs.] I know, I know. I know what you mean.
> 
> **WD**: Whoever even started that idea lacks imagination."
308,When did he work with Jane Lynch???
309,Willem Dafriend.
310,"I remember him being on the Jim & Sam radio show. He was really laid back, charming, and funny. One great moment was the host saying in jest ""I've got this great idea for a script where an old white cop and a black cop become friends"" or something like that, playing on how overdone this sort of thing is. Without missing a beat Willem goes ""only if I can play the black cop"""
311,haha that’s great
312,"Check which of these are posted to r/MovieDetails and post the ones that aren't already there.  
  
Here's a search for Parasite: https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/search?q=parasite+2019&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on"
313,"About using real life news studios, I don’t know if others feel the same but I hate it so much.

It doesn’t bother me when it’s in a foreign film because I didn’t grow up with them but when it’s done in a French film, it feels jarring, too realistic to be in a movie. It takes me out of the experience as much as actually changing the channel would."
314,"I understand where you’re coming from, but it’s so much cheaper and more convenient for a film doing a news scene (which are effective and logical ways to drop exposition as that is their real life function). It would be prohibitively expensive to create a news set just to do a 20 second info dump."
315,"one of my biggest problems with the film was that it honestly almost seemed like a vanity project for bradley. the title is about gaga’s character and it was marketed as though she was the star of the movie yet bradley’s character was the one with the most screentime, character development, etc.

the character was also an extremely shitty person yet we were made to feel sympathy for him for some reason."
316,"I had so many problems with this movie.  Like the fact that it’s a story about a woman that has no other women in it.  Really, she has no female friends or family? Bradley Cooper’s character is such a hardcore drunk from the get-go. What does she see in him?  The second she gets famous, the movie becomes all about him. We barely touch on how fame affects her.  There’s no paparazzi, no body shaming: she never meets any fans.  They really missed every opportunity to explore fame in the 21st century. 

It’s just a really poorly thought-out film."
317,"Her every other line was ""ok?"""
318,"I really wanted to like the movie. The chemistry between them was good but something about the relationship progression seemed unbelievable. 

I hate the ending so much."
319,"I agree with you. I have a really hard time rewatching it. Especially the scene where Cooper embarasses himself on stage. I know relapses are realistic and dramatic, but I hate watching them on screen for some reason."
320,"I liked this a lot the first time through, but agree with a lot of what you said the more time passes. The pacing through the second half was really slow, and I think the film could have been more consistent if they trimmed it down a bit."
321,"It is easily the worst of all three versions. Judy Garland, Barbara Streisand, and.... Lady Gaga?"
322,"Yeah Ally definitely could have used more screen time and character development. I wonder if that was originally the plan but they cut back on it because they felt Lady Gaga didn't quite have the acting skills. Not saying she did a bad job but there were multiple scenes with her and Cooper where I was thinking ""ok one of these people is an actor acting and the other is a singer acting"""
323,"Wow good call, I didn't even think about the lack of female characters. As far as their relationship goes I think we're supposed to take it as ""love doesn't make sense""."
324,"You should watch the first version with Janet Gaynor, it opens with her leaving her family (Because they think she should remain at home and not follow her dreams of becoming an actress) and having a lovely conversation with her grandma, who supports her."
325,"I just want to pick your brain as to why Ally needs to have female friends? Like is that a requirement?  It's evident that her friends are the LGBTQ - Ramon and the drag queens from the bar she works in. In fact, it is made clear the only reason she can perform at the bar is because of said friendship (""I get to be part of the gay girls""). Believe it or not, some LGBT spaces foster that sense of community and its possible that it doesn't include straight women. As for Bradley being a drunk,  it's an open secret that stars struggle with addictions given their circumstances, that doesn't stop them from being seen as stars by commoners, people are starstruck because they have charisma, regardless of their faults, that's part of why they've got to where they are. Not sure how her infatuation is difficult to believe (and it's not like she doesn't condone his behaviour/tries to help him get out of it) and to me, it's better for Jackson to already have his issues because the previous films have made it seem as though his demise/drinking is because of the female star's rise which is so outdated. Sam Elliott reminds us of that when he says that no one but Jackson is the reason for what happens, he got himself there, not Ally, that would be unfair to her character.  As for your other grievances, I understand, the depth of Ally's fame is not explored. At the same time, the film is meant to be a personal love story. A lot of the time it's not about fame itself, but how fame affects their relationship and that's what we get to see and what we want to see. We know the public repercussions of fame and what it comes with, that's cliche. Instead, we get to look at mental illness, the friction of creative integrity on their couple, the career sacrifices of loving someone deeply. It seems more compelling than seeing lady gaga cry because twitter trolls called her fat."
326,"Yeah too many things happen too fast. Meets her, then what the next night he brings her on stage and they sing a duet then they have sex? Then months(?) later he goes on a bender and makes his way to an old friend's house and he proposes to her and they get married that night? Like I guess it's supposed to be that they are both just people and they don't always know the best thing to do and ""love doesn't make sense"" but the film definitely pushed it. And yeah, the ending I really didn't buy that Ally's manager was able to push Jack to the edge like that. And if they were trying to make what Jack did look ""chivalrous"" then that's pretty fucked."
327,"That was definitely one of the ""over the top"" parts for me. Why not just have Jackson follow her to the stage and fall down on the steps? That would have accomplished everything they needed for that plot point."
328,Yeah it could've been at least 15 minutes shorter.
329,"I feel like most romance movies are about two people falling in love that don’t immediately make sense. But those movies have to makes us understand the attraction, chemistry, and the connection that those two have. We buy Harold and Maude!  We buy Julia Roberts as a street sex worker and Richard Gere as a business mogul falling in love.  We buy Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray.  We buy it when a straight man and a gay man have sex in Kiss of the Spider Woman as a kind of affirmation of their special bond."
330,"Yes, I’ve seen it. That’s a great example of how it’s been done well. And the Judy Garland version doesn’t give her a family, either, but she gets a whole song and dance about what it was like trying to make it in Hollywood since childhood. We really see everything though her perspective and we always understand what she is thinking."
331,"She needs to have female friends or family because almost all women on this planet do.  There's almost 4 billion of us.  If you're going to make a movie about a woman, our experiences and our relationships matter.  A Star Is Born was written by 3 men and it shows.  It’s so easy to just make the mother dead or gone rather than have to imagine how a relationship with a mother would affect the plot. The same is true of depictions of the LGBTQ community in mainstream films written by straight people. They are almost always portrayed as white, male, and have straight friends."

358,"""CEO-villain"" × ""Captain Marvel"" Yeah.... About that"
359,"They need to let him play Australian, his american accent lisp kills me"
360,"Yeah, pretty much. The only thing that was remotely enjoyable about Alien Covenant. Was watching Danny McBride play a character that wasn't 100% just Danny McBride.

And that character was still like 75% Danny McBride."

366,[deleted]
367,"He's also great in The Outsider, a new Stephen King adaptation he had a hand in producing on HBO."
368,He basically played an Australian alien in Captain Marvel.
369,"True, but he’s the same guy in 30 other movies."
370,"I disagree - Depp and HBC have the same scope of acting, that stems off from Tim Burton movies/Pirates (in Depp's case) and can be seen in other their works. For example in The Lone Ranger, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Fight Club or Harry Potter. Their variety of roles isn't that big, in my opinion. 

Even when HBC was playing Princess Margaret in The Crown that was seemingly a different role, she still had some of these HBC mannerisms that translated well to the type of roles she's usually getting, but it was jarring in her portrayal of Margaret.

Not denying they're good actors, but they do tend to get the same type of their roles - Edward Scissorhands/Jack Sparrow and Marla Singer/Bellatrix."
371,I've seen enough I'm not saying he's untalented but he gets typecast a lot.
372,"yup - and another example, Game Night, he plays a asshole, and not really the straight man. Its like he told his agent ""im done with that character"" lol"
373,"Depp roles that are not Burton/Pirates influenced: What's eating Gilbert Grape, Donnie Brasco, Benny and Joon, Public Enemies, Finding Neverland, Chocolat, Dead Man, Nick of Time, (all good movies by the way)

For Helena you shoud watch Howard's End, Hamlet, Burton and Taylor, The Sufragettes, The Wings of the Dove, The King's Speech

It's not that they don't have range. It's just that you only see a very limited type of movies."
374,"He really doesn’t though.  I’m sure you’re referring to him in gangster films such as Goodfellas, Casino and The Irishman.  But that’s not really typecasting that’s an Italian American working with a long time collaborator (Scorsese) who’s also an Italian American; making films that are part of their culture and upbringing.  

Other non-gangster films would include:  Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy,  New York New York, Deer Hunter, The Mission, 1900, Midnight Run, Awakenings, Cape Fear, Silver Linings Playbook, etc...  

But I understand why you think this.  It’s been said for years.  I just don’t agree at all."
375,"I did not get this impression at all.



The brother played by Kyle Chandler is the asshole. Bateman is just some uber competitive nerd with an inferiority complex doing his standard meek/""over-my-head"" thing, IMO."

377,What a cool article! And what I'd give to have that Forbidden Planet backdrop. My all time favorite old sci-fi flick.
378,">For her directorial debut, Maggie Gyllenhaal has tapped Oscar-winner Olivia Colman, Dakota Johnson, Jessie Buckley and Peter Sarsgaard to star in the feature adaptation of “[The Lost Daughter](https://variety.com/t/the-lost-daughter/).” Gyllenhaal also penned the script, which is based on the novel by best-selling author Elena Ferrante.  
>  
>“The Lost Daughter” tells the story of a college professor (Colman) whose own psychological trauma begins to resurface after meeting a woman (Johnson) and her young daughter while on summer vacation.

Sounds like a movie with a great cast and an interesting plot, let's see what Gyllenhaal's vision is like as a director."
379,You had me at Olivia Colman.
380,Her husband looks forward to another potential nomination
381,Im intrigued
382,"Such a great actress in a debut film from Maggie Gyllenhaal is really cool.   
Loved her in every single one of her films (or TV SHOWS, like Broadchurch).   
I'm looking forward to watch that, and am glad for Gyllenhaal's oportunity to become a filmmaker.   
Thumbs up."
383,"I can't not think of the scene from Peep show whenever I see her doing so well now.

384,Let’s hope she’s more Greta Gerwig and less Angelina Jolie
385,First They Killed My Father was pretty good.
386,I'd be surprised if she's a worse director than she is an actor.
387,As was Unbroken
388,Really? I thought she was great in *The Deuce*
389,"“On page 69 of the script, we get an early hint as to the meaning of that scene.”

*NICE!*"
390,"it also would have been directed like shit since it's also Trevorrow.  Even looking back on Safety Not Guaranteed, the film (which I still enjoy) was elevated by the charm of its wonderful cast, particularly Duplass and Plaza"
391,">Were you thirsting for more of the Knights of Ren in the Star Wars sequel trilogy?

honestly no and I've never understood the people who were.  They were total nothings with no relevance to anything.

Also, *not a goddamn plot hole*.  When these stupid articles talk about ""plot holes"" *it almost never really is*."
392,"This script, despite some cool ideas that I would've loved to see, would've likely been just as hated as ROTS."
393,Lol what is it with lightning lately
394,"Agreed. They were one throwaway line in TFA, and it was implied they were the students he led from Luke's temple. Just make them something for the comics/games, they really didn't need any screentime in the movie unless Disney were going to do something interesting with them."
395,"Not at all lol. I hate disney starwars but that script and the concept at was much better than what we got. Tbh, he should've directed the sequels."
396,"exactly, they were little more than just a blurb for supplementary media (comics, games, action figures) etc.  Much like the bounty hunters (except for Boba Fett) in Empire Strikes Back: they all appeared in one scene for less an 45 seconds.  Darth Vader tasked them with hunting down the Millennium Falcon but then Admiral Piett just walks up to Vader to say they just found them"
397,"Headline: ""FINAL KILL Trailer (2020) Billy Zane, Danny Trejo Action Movie HD""

398,I mean the extra footage didn't really change anything other than giving us more of the girl.. wish we had some more background on the roaming group and the hotel entity
399,"Am the only one who preferred the Theatrical Cut?

I love Doctor Sleep and saw it twice in theaters. I pre-ordered the Blu-Ray and was excited to see the Director’s Cut which I watched a few nights ago. Definitely prefer the original.

My issue wasn’t the length because those three hours absolutely flew by. I just didn’t like some of the new material and dialogue.

1. At the beginning, the addition in the DC of Violet’s mother looking for her after she’s presumably been killed by the True Knot felt like an anticlimactic way to end the scene compared to the TC

2. In the DC, when young Dan first goes into the bathroom at his house, the old woman is fully revealed from head to toe before he runs away, as opposed to the TC which just shows her hand starting to pull back the shower curtain. I prefer the “less is more” approach, especially considering we get several other scenes of the old woman in the bathtub throughout the movie.

3. The addition of the scene of Abra’s parents witnessing the piano playing itself felt unnecessary when the spoons-on-the-ceiling scene gets the job done.

4. Didn’t care for the dialogue where Crow says something to Rose about her being the “Queen Bitch”. Felt a little cheesy to me.

5. Around the scene where Dan gets a chip at his AA meeting and gives a speech, the DC inserts a scene that walks us through the Gold Room at the Overlook Hotel before zooming in to a glass of whiskey at the bar. I understand what this represents, but I don’t like how it spoils the “grand reveal” of getting to see inside the Overlook Hotel at the very end of the film.

6. I didn’t like the addition of the scene between Abra’s dad and the Crow when Abra is being abducted. In the TC, the way it is presented is that we see Abra’s dad watching over Abra while she does her thing. Then at some point it cuts back to Abra and her dad is no longer there. Then the next time it cuts back to her, the Crow injects her. It’s shocking because you are wondering what happened to her dad. The next time it cuts back to the Crow carrying Abra out of the house, the camera zooms in on the dad’s dead body. Again, less is more to me. It was shocking because obviously the Crow killed him off screen. In the DC, he still kills him off screen, but we get a scene of the dad confronting Crow after he injects Abra. Just felt less interesting to me because the sequence of events was explicitly spelled out, as opposed to being more chaotic and shocking.

7. During Dan’s confrontation with Jack Torrence in the Gold Room near the end of the film, the DC version has Dan refer to him as “Dad” more than once. I felt the TC was more effective in that they dance around the subject until Dan finally calls him “dad” just once near the climax of their conversation.

8. Continuing on from my previous point, I felt that the weight of their confrontation in the scene at the bar in the DC is much less impactful. Instead of the scene ending after Jack smashes the glass away from Dan like in the TC, the DC continues their conversation in a new scene in the red bathroom from The Shining. It was cool to see that set reconstructed, but their conversation in the bathroom is much less intense. Considering that is their final scene together, I preferred how it ended on a much more intense note in the TC’s bar scene.

9. Overall, I’m not a fan of the addition of the Chapter text overlays.

Just a few things off the top of my head. The Director’s Cur isn’t bad by any means, I just vastly preferred the choices that were made in the Theatrical Cut."
400,I’m very skeptical about that. That movie was extraordinarily mediocre.
401,"If anything most of the new footage was of Danny than Abra. A whole character aspect of Wendy not being able to look at Danny was added and strengthen his character (and the ending) considerably. His low points at the beginning was lengthen, we see him with Charlie longer, and of course the Overlook bar scene was lengthen and even went to the iconic bathroom. Hell, Rose got more new stuff than Abra."
402,"I agree on wanting more footage of the True Knot as a group—the Blu-ray’s making of hinted at more scenes with them. But we did get more scenes of how Crow and Rose’s dynamic worked, and more elaboration on their methods (background research, NSA contacts) and a new scene with Jack Torrance that further hinted at The Overlook wanting Abra and Rose over Dan.

More/extended scenes throughout made the whole film a different experience, in my opinion."
403,"in all my years of watching film, I've learned to never trust a director's cut, and will only watch if the universal opinion is that it's better (Blade Runner is the only example that comes to mind).

Donnie Darko, Apocalypse Now, Amadeus, Almost Famous

All great movies with director's cuts that completely destroy the pacing of the films."
404,"I could not disagree more, I thought it was one of the better films this year"
405,You’re one of the few people who I’ve heard say that. It was a great movie for a lot of people.
406,"> extraordinarily mediocre

Exceptionally ordinary"
407,"I was really confused by all the praise for this film. Everything felt forced and cheesy. Rebecca Ferguson is great but I can only take her so seriously walking around in that hat. There were a few interesting moments, but most of the time I could feel Kubrick rolling around in his grave."
408,"I've only seen the Director's cut ( yesterday ) , knew very little about it bar it had middling reviews , haven't read the book or knew any of the plot , not heard of the True Knot and as result enjoyed it far more than expected.

Also wanted much more of the True Knot. Enjoyed the first 2/3rds whilst it kept up the creepyness and tension, but kind of lost interest towards the end as it went all out once the shooting started."
409,I've only seen the director's cut and thought it was pretty great. It's one of the few movies I've seen that makes 3 hours feel like no time at all.
410,I guess I was just disappointed by it. Ewan McGregor did a fine job but the whole thing failed to really grab me for some reason.
411,"It was better than the book courtesy of being able to tie back into the abandoned Overlook rather than a tepid confrontation at ""Roof O' The World."" It still has a pretty impotent True Knot and glosses over a lot of Danny's struggles or any realism in a man just up and taking off with a young girl (especially considering the changes made in the film)."
412,"I've heard nothing but positive about it. I've heard mention on podcasts and interviews. If you were interested in seeing it in a theatre I'd suggest you keep a watchlist on a site that keeps release dates for your area.  
  
I think it's on home media now or soon."
413,It did well and yes it's worth the watch. You can clearly see that shia really had fun doing this movie.
414,I heard about it from my aunt a few months ago who watched it and she recommended it to me. It got fantastic reviews and audiences loved it. It’s a great film that is perfectly entertaining with something to say! Watch it when you can it’s worth everyone’s time .
415,"it is a fantastic movie. Shia is amazing in it, as is the lead. Its a great, feel good movie"
416,Great film. Definitely the feel good film of the past year. One of Shia's best that further solidifies his dramatic chops. Would recommend
417,Great movie.
418,"“Fun” fact:

Shia’s arrest and subsequent rehab as portrayed in Honeyboy happened during the filming of the Peanut Butter Falcon."
419,"It was a great watch! Very wholesome and entertaining.

The leads presented at the Oscars together this week!"
420,"It's good, entertaining and rewatchable but there were too many good films last year for it to make my top list."
421,Sounds cool! I'll check it out for sure.
422,"The roommate was partially at fault. And yeah, stand up comics are notorious for being assholes to each other."
423,"no, not really. a24 just isn’t able to campaign as hard as other studios. add onto that it being an almost entirely foreign language film, and it being directed by a woman, i wouldn’t be surprised if some voters skipped watching it"
424,"Probably not. A lot of these boutique distributors like A24 and Neon pool their resources around one film per awards season. In last year's case, A24's big push was for Uncut Gems."
425,They are completely different films. The fact they are set in Asian countries is literally the only thing they've in common. The Farewell had no chance because A24 somehow messed up with all their movies this year.
426,Is it your belief that it was overlooked because only one Asian film at a time can get attention?
427,A24 should have lobbied the Academy for The Farewell to compete for Best International Film. It qualifies because it's mostly in Chinese and could have taken the spot of Corpus Christi.
428,I didn't find it to be that particularly good of a movie.
429,"I saw an article saying that some voters didn’t watch it at all, along with Uncut Gems and Hustlers. So you’re right to say that."
430,"Well that push didn’t work apparently haha.

Someone in another thread said the guy who did most of the campaigning for a24 went to Netflix. Could be the reason they went from winning a best picture to basically getting no Oscar love."
431,"> I have a feeling that Academy Awards don't have many quota for Asian theme/cast movies.

certainly seems so"
432,I don’t think it’s a big leap to state that movies outside of traditional narratives don’t tend to do well at the Academy Awards. There’s a reason people are so surprised about Parasite.
433,"wow. i’m not happy to be right, but i’m not surprised. those three were absolutely snubbed"
434,"I totally agree, it’s a shame. A24 had a great year too and I was hoping for at least one. Hustlers was great as well and I think Lopez earned her nom. Oh well, maybe next year."
435,ask in r/tipofmytongue

438,"That's it.  Eye is listed as ""I"" which may be why I had trouble finding it. Thanks!!"
439,"I found it to be hilarious, as expected. Too bad it's such a short film but I guess it's for the best, though I would've loved to see more of that insanity."
440,"I'm one of maybe 14 people that liked ""Rubber"", I have to see this.  
Too bad I live in a cinematic wasteland."
441,"So this is the same guy behind Mr Oizo, Flat Beat has become such influential track for different genres."

459,Bro-tastic!
460,"I had written my reply in Moviesuggestions but noticed that it was deleted so here it is. It's a really nice list with some really great movies! What could be noted is that it is somewhat focused on a select group of directors (4 tarantino's, 2 Nolans, 2 Scorseses, 1 by the Coen brothers and 1 Bong). There is nothing wrong with having more movies by the same director in your top 10 cause that particular director might just suit your taste.

My critique stems from the fact that I think watching movies is also about broadening your horizon. You might be pleasantly surprised by how a movie outside your normal pattern might surprise you. Judging by your top 10, I think Parasite might've been such an experience for you. If you like cinema and you want to know more, my advise is to go out and explore. This is not to say that a certain genre is less than another genre but to simply drink in all it has to offer. If you like *Django Unchained* and *The Hateful Eight*, why not watch some older movies by an Italian like Sergio Leone (1929-1989) or *[Brimstone (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci3OHOolzEk)* by the Dutch director Martin Koolhoven (1969), for example."
461,"Good list, all pretty well known to be very good films. Only film on there I’m not the biggest fan of is Django (but still liked)"
462,"If you haven’t seen Apocalypse Now, Old Boy, There Will Be Blood and Fight Club you would probably like them."
463,"Personally think The Thing belongs up in there somewhere, also True Romance but hey, to each their own"
464,epic
465,"I’d recommend watching more than one type of movies. Branch out. Watch different movies by different kinds of filmmakers. Don’t get stuck in the film bro bubble of Nolan and Tarantino and Scorsese and the Coen Brothers et al. Watch foreign films, watch films directed by women, watch slice of life indies, watch comedies. 

Limiting yourself to one quite narrow type of movie (even if you love blood and violence) will just make you miss out on a lot of great stuff. 

Parasite is a nice entry to Korean cinema, for instance. You could do The Host next, or Memories of Murder. Burning is one of my favorite recent movies from South Korea."
466,What do you mean by saying you don't have great taste?
467,Mr. Orange was a hero.
468,"The one thing that jumps out at me, other than the many obvious things, is that I’m surprised Scarface isn’t on there. 

This is very much the list of someone who has a Scarface poster in their bedroom."

472,Im noticing a trend.
473,"1. I’ll get shit for it but pulp fiction is overrated imo. Didn’t really care for it. 

2. Good and original. However I hate this movie for spawning that “BRAGHHHHH” noise every movie feels they need to do now. 

3. Good

4. Haven’t seen

5. I do not understand the hype with this movie. I really did not like it. Maybe my expectations were too high? Idk but man I was really disappointed with this. 

6-9. haven’t seen

10. Didn’t really care for this one. 

I apparently do not enjoy anything lol"
474,"Why do you care what other think of your top 10? You love the movies you love and you're in no control of that. Cinema as any other art is 100% about personal preference and totally subjective so there is no ""better taste"". If people critisize you they're just plain stupid snobs. 

Your list is great! Lots of amazing films."
475,"Try watching some female directed movies, nothing wrong with the list but it might bring a different perspective. Try a Ladybird, atonement, other stuff along those lines."
476,"I've seen worse lists but having said that there is way too much Tarantino on here. I understand he is popular with teenage boys but try watching more movies from different genres, different decades and different countries."
477,"Good list but too much Tarantino, Nolan... I'd personnaly put n°10 higher in the list.

Try to watch Classics, European and more Asian movies especially Korean and your Top 10 will look completely different."
478,"
>a theme of violence here

OP would enjoy *A History of Violence*"
479,If there was an AI that could predict who you were based of your movie preferences and it saw this list it would most likely guess that OP has a 99.5% chance of being male. Probably predict a high chance of being white and between 18-30.
480,"Thank you so much for constructive criticism. I have this weird system where I go by director which I know is not the best way to do it, but it calms me. My list is full of directos and I have a list of solo movies that include those by Sergio Leone, Seven Samurai, Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away etc.) and I can’t wait to see more foreign films. I’ve been trying to broaden my horizons and step into dramas, rather than thrillers and crime movies, but I haven’t found many worth adding. I’m absolutely having great fun doing this."
481,"Have watched Fight Club, and it was up there for a while. Felt it was bested by No country for old men and Taxi Driver. All the rest are in my list. Thanks!"
482,Just started starting to watch movies seriously and I’ll try to get there soon. The Handmaiden is also on my list for Korean movies. Thanks!

493,"Or maybe even nightingale ,American honey or fish tank"

495,Thanks!
496,Or Eastern Promises by the same director (Cronemberg) and with Mortensen again. God that bath scene was tough to watch
497,"I would stake my entire life on those numbers, good chance of being younger too"
498,"I'm glad to hear you liked it! I am still going mainly by director as well and I see nothing wrong with it.    I think the more arthouse movies will slowly grow onto you. You will get used to and understand the slower pace of these movies better and better, for example. 

I think a step in the direction of these kinds of movies that you will probably enjoy are 'In Order of Disappearance (2014)' by the Norwegian director Hans-Petter Moland (1955), 'There Will be Blood' (2007) by the American director Paul Thomas Anderson (1970) and 'Drive' by Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn (1970). Oh and don't forget the movies by the Irish directors John Michael McDonagh (1967) and Martin McDonagh (1967)"
499,I don't get it lol
500,"Don't worry about it, it's a very quick watch and offers a much different perspective from a Tarantino."
501,"Will do! Paul Thomas Anderson is on there because Magnolia, The Master, There will be blood and Boogie Nights"
502,Oh I said it cuz you username says Django. Mistake
503,"Yeah what I was trying to say was that, it's not like there are bad movies in the list so there's nothing wrong with your taste lol, it just seems like you like more this kind of films. You like them because of the genre or do you think you have favorite genres or do you like them because of their director and their style?"
504,Mix of all those really
505,"I see then I'd say to try to watch all their filmography and given that they are all pretty open about their favorites movies and what films inspired them try to see if you can watch those movies too, you can discover some interesting stuff. Especially Scorsese and Tarantino made a ton of list about their favorite movies. Also it seems like for genres you like westerns (Hateful Eight, Django), gangster movies (Pulp Fiction), psycological thriller (Taxi Driver, The Prestige). So for westerns checks out some classics like Leone's movies, he's one of the best director ever, Corbucci's The Great Silence, wonderful western set in the snow who ispired Tarantino's The Hateful Eights, Ford's The Searchers, Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and some more moderns westerns like Kim Jee Woon's The Good, The Bad, The Weird or Miike'a Sukiyaki Western Django (Tarantino does a cameo in this film). For gangster movie, apart from Scorsese's movies, I'd say checks out classics like Untouchables, Scarface, The Godfathers, Boyz in the hood, The Public Enemy and more modern movies like Bittersweet Life, Infernal Affairs, History of Violence, Animal Kingdom. For psycological thriller checks out Vertigo, Mullholand Drive, Seven, Oldboy, maybe Rosemary's Baby and Psycho (they are more horrors), El Secreto de sus ojos, Prisoners."
506,I think it was the Black Mirror episode ‘White Christmas’?
507,"It's definitely Black Mirror: White Christmas

Guy's girlfriend blocks him all of a sudden and then she has a kid. He spends the entire episode trying to find a way to make contact, believing the kid is his."
508,Krull
509,the sub to ask is r/tipofmytongue
510,"I think there was a similar sci fi movie but I am not sure, When I looked up White Christmas, I am wondering if thats the one. I maybe getting confused with a movie where Mickey Rourke being a wrestler getting ignored by his daughter no matter what he did.

So it has be black mirror white christmas lol thank you!"
511,Have you seen krull?
512,Yes.  Have you?
513,Yep. Is awesome
514,Darn tootin' it is.
515,"Couldn't find a star, ninja or otherwise, for first comment"
516,"I’m really excited about it because I heard that it talks about Alice Guy-Blaché, the very first female director and yet pretty much forgotten.

She was in the room when the Lumière brothers presented their invention, made some of the first films ever and even made what is believed to be the first film starring an all African American cast, rediscovered recently."
517,Directed by Mark Cousins.
518,There's nothing more unrealistic than a romcom. To the point these things don't really stand out.
519,Dialogue that would never happen in real life? I have that feeling with so many movies.
520,"I think calling it incel-y a bit too much but I think he writes what he knows from experience,  he probably sees or saw himself  as fat nerdy nice guy that ended up with a wife out of his league.  So what you think is unrealistic is actually reality in his world . I agree his dialogue is crap but he may really not know how to talk to women."
521,No
522,That they are not as bad as Chasing Amy.
523,Why would you want to watch a realistic movie?
524,"Oh yes, 100%. 

A lot of the creepy men I’ve dealt with have had some type of similarity to a Kevin Smith character. Partly why I’ve never liked his movies apart from Dogma. 

He’s the type of guy to randomly tell off a guy for not watching a movie with a female lead and automatically claiming their sexist before even asking them what they’re issue is. He’s that type of man, and that’s why he has always irritated me."
525,Well more like Male lesbian
526,"I was thinking that. That all rom coms are unrealistic. Usually they are targeting a female audience however. The Kevin Smith ones are just rom coms for men. So rather than it being sappy girl stuff its sappy guy stuff, which in a lot cases can come off very neckbeardy and ""virgin-y"". Not used to seeing a rom com made with the male audience in mind."
527,When keyboard warriors think too hard (not you OP)
528,That didn't stop him from getting married and having a kid.
529,"I don't know what's wrong with Chasing Amy in this context. What I took from that movie is that Amy has the right to be who she is and have a past without being judged or labeled for it, and that Holden is not much better than Banky in the end."
530,Chasing Amy was his best one imo. Even though that woman's voice kills me.
531,"They're sexist*

What their issue is*"
532,"Oh no, I'm not talking about the quality of the movie, I'm talking about the vibes."
533,Oh I’m sorry! English isn’t one of my first languages. Thank you!
534,"Hey, are you trying to communicate? Those aren't valid sentences."
535,Then honestly great job lol you know it more than I know any other language lol
536,Yeah the dialogue is very to the point.
537,holy shit are you me? I too have ADHD and can’t do subtitles. I’ve said this out loud to pretty much every person who’s asked me if I’ve seen it. Thanks for this post.
538,There's another of his movies that I really liked called Mother. It's also subtitled but I think you should check it out.
539,"I have ADHD and love movies as well, but I've often found subtitled movies even easier to focus on than non-subtitled. When I'm watching something in English, I find myself getting distracted by things around me (mostly my phone), but with subtitled films, the increased activity of having to constantly shift my focus from the subtitles to the action generally allows me to better keep track of the movie. Is that always true? No. And then I have to rewind. But a lot of the time anyway!"
540,"That's funny - because of my ADD, I actually turn the subtitles for shows and movies in English since it helps me focus on the dialog."
541,"Yeah that’s what I loved, the dialogue is amazing I was fully invested in every word, definitely deserving of the screenplay win"
542,"No problem, just thought I’d share a bit of my story with it so others who struggle with subtitles might not be as intimidated"
543,My dad who has adhd loves foreign films and says the exact same thing however my brother in law is like me who has a harder time focusing with subtitles
544,I'd also credit the acting. The cast did a great job expressing emotions and physically acting out their dialogue. I think Bong knew this movie would have international appeal and did a great job ensuring the movie could be enjoyed on a visceral level.
545,">This looks like the most Wes Anderson film ever.

Said about every Wes Anderson film ever."
546,Henry fucking Winkler in a Wes Anderson movie.
547,There's our next production design winner at the Oscars.
548,Is this a wes anderson film? I can't really tell
549,Gotta go sit in the exact middle of my room for this one
550,The scene of Chalamet and McDormand speaking while he’s in the bathtub...classic Wes Anderson
551,Nice to see Owen Wilson in a bigger role for once. Probably his first since The Darjeeling Limited.
552,Cast your votes as to whom the “Graphic Nudity” warning refers to. I’m leaning Chalamet because of the bathtub scene but Del Toro is a dark horse.
553,Wes Anderson. Black and white. Aspect ratio. Timotheeeeeee. France. JOURNALISM.
554,"Of all the Wes Anderson movies out there, this is the most recent"
555,"And Ebenezer Scrooge opened his window and saw a young boy and shouted, ""you there, what day is it?""

""Today? Why it's New Wes Anderson Trailer Day!""

And Tiny Tim did not die for he had something to live for."
556,I’d forgotten how much I love Owen Wilson in Wes Anderson’s movies
557,They might as well just engrave the Oscar for production design a year in advance to save time.
558,"There is something so relaxing about Wes Anderson's films. Most characters are extremely soft spoken, sounds are harmonious and uplifting and the cinematography, well its just a pleasure for the the eyes."
559,It's odd not seeing FOX above Searchlight anymore
560,"Yup... that's Wes Anderson alright...

Can't fucking wait."
561,"That cast is fantastic and I love the switches between black and white and color. Timothée looks great and yeah, the ending got me.

Edit: What’s the song? Is it apart of the score I’m guessing?"
562,"The Oscars *just* happened, you're not supposed to deliver award contenders this early!"
563,"There's something that looks so amazing about this movie...it has all the Wes elements but stills feel fresh and more dynamic, I'm loving it"
564,"I don't know why, but that shot of Saorsie Ronan is really strikingly beautiful to me."
565,"If theres Saoirse, I will be watching"
566,Will Wes Anderson ever make a movie that I’m not excited about? Not today at least
567,The cast is fucking amazing and I think this going to be the most *Wes Anderson*est movie ever.
568,"Bernie the frontrunner, Strokes new single, new Wes Anderson trailer.

&#x200B;

Big week for straight white dudes who went to small liberal arts colleges ^(like myself)"
569,The black and white sequences look gorgeous and peak Wes. It’s like he heard everyone say he couldn’t make a Wes Anderson movie without pastel colors.
570,"Okay, that black and white shot of the person coming through the wall? That blocking is nuts. This movie looks so good!"
571,"Del Toro is someone I never expected would work well with Wes, but this trailer already proves that notion wrong. Very excited for this!"
572,Timmy is upping his unkempt hair game.
573,And the academy award for best cinematography goes to...
574,wes anderson you son of a bitch im in
575,"Honestly they should just cancel the Oscars next year and give him all the awards since he already cast the *entire* Hollywood.

PS: **Saoirse Ronan**"
576,Can it really be more Wes Anderson than [fake Wes Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfDIAZCwHQE)?
577,HOLY FUCKBALL SOUP WHAT A CAST INJECT THIS SHIT STRAIGHT INTO MY VEINS
578,*The Post: A Wes Anderson Film*
579,how does wes anderson seem to out-wes anderson himself in every film he makes?
580,If Léa Seydoux and Timothée Chalamet don’t speak French at some point during this film I’ll be pretty upset
581,I can see that this will be a masterpiece
582,">I can see that

I envy Frances McDormand."
583,"Seems like this might be for Wes Anderson what *Buster Scruggs* was for the Coen Brothers. Speaking of which that's Mike Yanigata from *Fargo*! 

Looks good, Anderson's style can be a bit hit or miss for me but I usually find they get better with re-watches, especially the more 'grand' ones."
584,"The diagrammed sentence:
""They will fail to notice the torn ticket stub for an unclaimed hat which sits alone on the upper shelf of a cloakroom in a bus depot on the outskirts of the work-a-day town where were apprehended Nickerson and his accomplices."""
585,"Oh my god Cécile de France is in this.

I haven’t seen her since Around the World in 80 Days."
586,Anyone actually know what this is about I’m lost
587,I thought Grand Budapest Hotel was perfect and yet this looks even better than that
588,Timothee and saoirse back at it...count me in
589,There's the Wes style I love. Can't wait for this one
590,Timothée Chalamet will be giving Bob Dylan vibes for the entirety of 2020.
591,"All those cast names appear, and the frame - and my brain - explodes in sheer awesomeness. 

Wes is back and I can't wait."
592,I want this movie right now.
593,"Imagine a world where[ this is the ""oh, and also these people were there, too""](https://i.imgur.com/Dj75Lt1.png)

Seriously, that alone is star-studded."
594,This is like Wes Anderson distilled down to his essence.
595,This is just brilliant.
596,Timothee Chalamet is an actor high in demand.
597,"Wes Anderson watched that FBI home invasion gif and was like ""I can make a whole about this."""
598,Oooh chalamet and seydoux seems to be the couple in this movie. Lucky guy
599,Love me some Wes Anderson. Can’t wait
600,Once again just another absolutely stacked cast in a Wes Anderson movie
601,"It's like,  how much more Wes Anderson can you get? The answer is none, none more Wes Anderson."
602,Does anyone know the name of the last song they played?
603,Norton is the voice on the phone.
604,"Anybody know the french song midway through? Sounds like he's saying ""je crier"" and ""arrive"" repeatedly"
605,At what point is Wes Anderson going to become a parody of himself?
606,"Having just thumbed through every frame of Isle of Dogs and Grand Budapest Hotel to study set pieces, I very much welcome more material to pore over. Some styles of shots in the trailer I’ve never seen in one of his films before (rear-mounted wheelchair cam), looking forward to it!"
607,What is the song at the end of the trailer?
608,The opening narration makes me feel like it's a sequel to Stranger than Fiction
609,"I sometimes feel pretentious saying “oh I love Wes Anderson” because it seems a little like he’s the guy to love to FEEL smart if you know what I’m saying...

But man I love Wes Anderson. His movies are like illustrated books brought to life. Balance, composition, tone. Even if the colors give me headaches at times. And a few of them have that 45 minute in slowdown that I hate (just a personal opinion, a lot of my favorite movies have that and I love them anyway).

Most of all it’s nice to see someone making what they love."
610,this is exactly the same movie as Grand Budapest.... literally
611,I have watched this three times and I still have no idea what its about
612,"Well, i can confirm that i'm not a Wes Anderson guy"
613,"Dude can make something look pretty and clearly great actors want to work with him, but I just can't get into his movies. I don't know what it is."
614,"Multiple aspect ratios AND switches from colour to black and white??? 

How many dang notices are mainstream theatres gonna have to put up for this one?"
615,"Wes Anderson is the ""Johnny Depp character in any given Tim Burton movie"" of directors.

Not gonna see this flick. You see one Anderson film, you've seen them all."
616,Same old crap from this director.
617,"Wes Anderson movies are *fine*. You've seen one, you've seen them all. 

Sometimes I wish he would move out of his comfort zone and do something daring; but some directors lack that ambition, and it's probably for the best."
618,I like most of Wes Anderson’s films but I can never get excited for his next one since they all feel like the exact same thing.
619,"The shot of the camera spinning around the table is very un-Wes Anderson, but otherwise this looks like the most Wes Anderson-ist movie ever."
620,This looks like it’s all over the place
621,"Colour me (in a pastel pallet, of course) excited!"
622,"This looks amazing. Production design is off the charts. The cast is stacked.
I'll admit the reason I checked the trailer out is because of Timothee Chalamet and he looks amazing in this trailer but this looks so cool that I want to see all the other Wes Anderson movies ( I've only seen Budapest) ."
623,Looks like a visual feast. I’m in.
624,"Man what an insane cast, that might be the most combined talent I've ever seen in a single film."
625,This looks like if every Wes Anderson film had a 2 hour orgy on acid
626,it's like all of his previous movies had a child and then that child smoked a cigarette
627,"""I am a genre"" should be his bloody name!"
628,"The most Wes Anderson, Wes Anderson can be. Like each of his movies compressed into one."
629,It take 1.3 seconds to identify a movie as a Wes Anderson movie. You could probably write a computer program to do it.
630,Seems like another movie that no one will see yet will sit at 98% on rotten tomatoes forever
631,This was a little messy....
632,I love how it goes through the cast at the end and then just drops a card with like 20 amazing actors.
633,"It looks...fantastic

That preview, and this cup of darjeeling I'm currently nursing, has me so twitterpated I had to loosen my ascot."
634,Can't wait for this to come out so I can stop rewatching The Grand Budapest Hotel
635,Is Adrien Brody just doing the same character from GBH?
636,I can’t wait to see this! Timothee Chamelet is such a good Wes Anderson fit
637,"Ugh I feel like Wes Anderson is now just trying to Out-Wes-Anderson himself. You know what I’d like to see from him? Something totally different. Like a Nior crime drama that actually uses closeups and minimal set design. Or better yet, practical locations. I feel like he should have been theatre guy. I mean...I'll still see it."
638,Wes Anderson continues to out Wes Anderson himself.
639,"Im not much of a studied movie fan, but that was absolutely beautiful."
640,Why does every scene look like a baroque painting?
641,"What an epic cast! Amazing to see some of the actors on the final cast list that don't even make the cut of the trailer - Anjelica Huston, Liev Schreiber, Edward Norton, etc. Those are some huge stars to leave out of the advertising. And did Kate Winslet and Alex Lawther drop out? Or did they run out of space to feature/credit them?"
642,Holy shit......this CAST
643,Every time I see someone say this about an actual Wes Anderson movie it feels so redundant and unnecessary to me. Like it’s so Wes Anderson to make a Wes Anderson styled movie? Yeah it’s... Wes Anderson
644,Seeing that logo at the start without Fox on it looks ... weird.
645,To me Wes Anderson films always feel like I’m reading a picture book. Something that harkens back to childhood. Makes his stuff incredibly rewatchable.
646,Vignettes are smart for a cast like this. Trying to get this many famous people in the same place would be daunting. This is a much more Tarantino approach.
647,"Man I’m hyped. I wonder if he can outdo Grand Budapest, which i see as the high note of an already incredible career. What a cast!"
648,what?
649,"im so done with his shtick and the story looks very boring 

his animated films are better, this just looks stale"
650,"Unpopular Opinion, but Wes Anderson films are starting to get stale to me. I feel like he's found too much comfort in his style and hasn't really innovated for years. I like it when a director will go into new genres with their style and tell their version of a story. Wes Anderson has become like a TV show going into their 10th season where there's hardly any innovation and we just get the same thing as before."
651,The man's got a style and he fucking sticks to it
652,I've only said that about The Grand Budapest Hotel cause he really went all out with the aesthetic there. The French Dispatch is like a spiritual sequel in that sense
653,"I dunno, he's getting so Wes Anderson-y that I feel like he's kind of turning into Guy Maddin a bit."
654,"I’ve been saying this for a while but I am fully ready for Wes to detonate his style and go for something totally new. 

It makes me think of Woody Allen’s early career. For years and years Woody had a distinctive, iconic formula for his comedy’s, which were mostly high concept, slapstick, 4th wall breaking films that got him his start. He became famous for the style. Then, years in he went and made Stardust memories, which was a knock on his own style and made fun of the fanatical fans who worshipped then.

From there in he dropped the over the top stylings and stripped everything waaaay back, and made his films far more character and story focused as opposed to sight gags and gimmicks. Entering a totally new phase. It was the growth of an artist who went from being pigeon holed to something far more pervasive and transcendent of any one style or thing.

I really really hope someday at least, Anderson challenges himself and dares to do something totally unexpected. He’s a true visionary but I do feel like he needs to get out of his comfort zone and push things in a new way."
655,Its always true though.
656,Yeah but this time it might be true
657,"> This looks like the most Wes Anderson film ever.

That was honestly my reaction as well. It's like Wes Anderson said, ""Hey, you know who makes good movies? That Wes Anderson fellow. I should make one in his style.""

It's like the Being John Malkovich of Wes Anderson movies."
658,Haha ya Crazy how a Wes Anderson movie would resemble a Wes Anderson movie
659,I really enjoyed his last movies Paddington 2 and JoJo Rabbit
660,How has this not happened? It’s a match made in heaven
661,He’s very good
662,"Christopher Waltz too, that list of secondary actors has me even more excited then the ones featured."
663,He once brought a loaded Beretta to a full house audition... just to feel the weight of it
664,I love that hes getting somewhat of a career renaissance due to how good he is in Barry
665,The Fonzzzz
666,I have obtained exactly one celebrity autograph in person (not counting sports figures). HW is that one and I cherish it.
667,"Man, when you have so many damn good actors in your movie that even the list of secondary actors contains names like Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Chirstoph Waltz, Henry Winkler, Elisabeth Moss.."
668,crazy to think his films have only won Best Production Design once (Grand Budapest Hotel) when production design is one of the biggest factors of his films.
669,And Costume design
670,Needs more symmetry and color pastels.
671,Still waiting for a horror flick in Wes Anderson’s color palette. Something like Rosemary’s Baby or the Amityville Horror.
672,"Although that last scene with the cops breaking into that room gave me a strong Blazing Saddles vibe, where the last bit of that movie is everyone fighting each other and busting through walls of a movie studio."
673,I dont know. I didnt see any(enough?) models
674,Reminds me of Wes Anderson’s [other film](https://youtu.be/gfDIAZCwHQE) A Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders
675,The exact middle of my yellow room
676,"Lmao. Cinema, right?"
677,Twitter is about to have an aneurysm seeing Chalamet in a bathtub.
678,Also the phone call from Ed Norton's character about kidnapping.
679,Franny and Zoey vibes
680,His voice and delivery are perfect for Wes Anderson's dialogue. Same goes for Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman.
681,"Owen and Jason being back put a big ole smile on my face. 

I also wish that Wilson and Anderson wrote together again. The three scripts they wrote together are some of my favorites by Wes. His stuff with other collaborators like Noah Baumbach are still incredible (The Life Aquatic ) m, there’s something about those first three movies that’s different from the rest of his filmography."
682,~~uh Wonder~~ oh you mean in a Wes Anderson movie
683,Wow
684,"You're joking right? Sarcasm doesn't translate well in text, or I am just true to my username.

He's been in plenty big movies since then."
685,Lightning McQueen.
686,lea seydoux probably. The trailer says she was the guard to the painter. The painter persuaded her to strip down for a nude portrait. There is a shot at 0:51 where she is striking a pose.
687,I vote Willem Dafoe and his mighty dong.
688,"The bathtub is a red herring I think, Timmy had it in his contract during CMBYN that he would do no full-frontal"
689,"I could always go for some Elisabeth Moss graphic nudity. But she looks like a very minor character, so not likely.

Also, she has been busy as fuck lately. I'm seeing her in everything. Reminds me of the period between 2012 and 2013 when Jude Law was basically in every movie."
690,We can only hope it’s a chala ding dong
691,Bill Murray
692,Wes is too heterosexual to put a dick on screen
693,Only Child. Illinois. CHICAGO
694,Clubs. Girls. Dancing. Naked. Mom? Argument. Fleeing the scene. Hiding in a dumpster. Coming here. Crashing on your couch for a week ‘cause {technically I’m homeless}.
695,"Not just any journalism, but New Yorker journalism, which is (of course) the most Wes Anderson style of journalism."
696,I may have soiled my pants.
697,Bravo
698,Thanks Perd Hapley.
699,Well said
700,[r/perdverts](https://www.reddit.com/r/perdverts/)
701,You're fired.
702,Big if true
703,"How could you say something so controversial, yet so brave?"
704,I wanna watch a Wes Anderson Christmas Carol.
705,*[Weaooooooow](https://youtu.be/KlLMlJ2tDkg)*
706,It's practically the only movies he still does anymore. The man hasn't been in a movie since 2017.
707,Yep. And then you cry at the end.
708,Drop the Fox. Just Searchlight. Its cleaner.
709,I’ll miss it.
710,We don't say the f-word anymore
711,Each new Wes Anderson movie looking like the most Wes Anderson movie since the last
712,"is there any other director of his kind? where one still of the movie or a single screenshot and you immediately know its a Wes Anderson picture? His movies are so distinctly unique and a breath of fresh air that i hope he keeps making movies until old age. You do you, Mr. Anderson!"
713,The song is a cover of [Aline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aline_(song\)) by Christophe. A french classic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_Hyn53acA
714,This trailer is already a shoe-in for best short film
715,It's releasing in July so there's still quite some time.
716,"It's a lot to do with the fact that he takes 2-3 years to make a movie (So there's a decent gap) and no one has successfully copied his style (Market isn't saturated). Plus the fact that his last one was Stop-Motion so it looked very different, so the actual last time we saw a movie like this was 6 years ago with Grand Budapest."
717,The Fresh Dispatch
718,"Just from watching the trailer, it looks like a movie I'm going to have to watch more than once to pick up on all the nuances."
719,I felt that way for Isle of Dogs. The Japanese style stood out compared to the sort of “standard” Wes Anderson vibe
720,Probably because it’s Saoirse Ronan.
721,She profits tremendously off of black and white due to bright hair and even brighter eyes.
722,Its odd shes not mentioned in the casting at the end or even the cast list.
723,She also had the most beautiful shot in The Grand Budapest Hotel. Probably don't need to say which one because everybody who's seen the movie knows what I'm talking about but here it is https://youtu.be/dyd3JzIIm44
724,[And I'll watch](https://i.imgur.com/svAsJ8K.jpg)
725,Same
726,Surprised to see her name didn't appear in the main credits tho.
727,Even most of the actors that were listed but are not in the trailer are excellent!
728,That scene of the shoot out was the most Wes Anderson shoot out I've ever seen and I never realized how much I needed one.
729,"Shit, I'm gay. Foiled again."
730,Wait the Strokes made a new single?
731,"New [Strokes song?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CAz_vvsK9M)  hell yeah!

I went to a big school and it sucked, can I get another go?

edit:  that song was kinda weird."
732,"Find me a director Del Toro *wouldn't* work well with. Between The Usual Suspects, Sicario/Soldado, the MCU, Star Wars, this and whatever else - that man has incredible range."
733,"I thought he was Jemaine Clement at first, and now I really want to see Jemaine in a Wes Anderson film."
734,The Oscars was just a ruse!  Fooling us all because he knew ultimate messy hair was coming in less than a week.
735,That made me curious to check. Wes Anderson's cinematographer of choice Robert Yeoman was only nominated for Grand Budapest Hotel. Maybe this time? I love this style.
736,I think Dune would be up there with it.
737,"SAVE SOME OF THAT SHIT FOR ME, RUB IT ON MY GUMS"
738,Distilled Wes Anderson Clones. He blends them up and drinks them.
739,"That is what I thought, except I didn't like Buster Scruggs because it really didn't tie the narratives together well IMO. There was no real overarching story to keep it related. This looks like a great way to do it. Connecting the stories to a news journal that covered them keeps things together."
740,then go watch The New Pope!
741,"Its seemingly going to be about a paper that covers a few various stories, likely a lot of ""short films"" put into a single piece, with the papers being the connecting thread."
742,I think it’s basically law now that if one of them stars in a movie that the other must be in it too.
743,"""Aline"" (Christophe 1965)"
744,"It's Christophe - Aline, but I think it's a cover."
745,"cover of ""Aline"" by Christophe (1965)"
746,I understand the visual appeal of it.  But his movies bore the ever living hell out of me.
747,I just don’t get the appeal.
748,"I don't know man. Wes Amderson has created this shtick that is so unique to him that even Hollywood can't seem to emulate it like they always do with other stuff. 

If he was creating constant movies like that the way Marvel is currently doing,then you have a point. But he is only releasing his movies once every few years."
749,"It does feel like a little *too* Anderson, doesn't it? The trailer was almost distracting with how 'Anderson' it was? I didn't get the same feeling from any of his past works. Agreed that the style might be getting stale."
750,"There aren't very many directors with such distinctive visual style. I understand how some people could be turned off by the sameness of his work, but I love it. I also love ensemble casts and dry humor so really I'm just a sucker for it all."
751,"Whimsy, emotional detachment and pastel colours."
752,Got to love it. Although I did see some handheld and 360 dollying in there. Good to see some Rushmore Wes back.
753,I was thinking it was giving me Life Aquatic vibes
754,yet Rushmore is my favorite of his and it's the least Wes Andersony movie he's done. Don't get me wrong i love all his films but Rushmore is the tops
755,"The Wes aesthetic.  The westthetic, if you will."
756,"I'm always happy to have Wes, because there are so few people who do what he does, but at a certain point the sheer Wes-ness gets distracting. I have a hard time taking it all in because I'm like ""yup, there's the symmetry, there's the yellow text, there's Bill Murray..."""
757,"While I see where you are coming from I do not agree. There is only one Wes Anderson and I like that he makes movies that are very distinctly his.

Reminds me of the Gaiman quote that goes:

*""There are better writers than me out there, there are smarter writers, there are people who can plot better - there are all those kinds of things, but there’s nobody who can write a Neil Gaiman story like I can.""*"
758,"I'd argue that he already did that with his stop motion animation films. That was a pretty radical departure. This French Dispatch film also looks like a new phase with all the black and white and the action sequences. I mean, compare this to Rushmore, y'know? He's growing and changing, definitely. I can't say I agree with you. But I WILL say that's he definitely going in a 'MORE!' direction. The long, Altman-esque stylized extravaganzas. More stars, more expensive effects, more set pieces. I'm with you in the way that I would like to see a very simple film with one or two stars experiencing and interesting chapter in a relationship, told in a neighborhood in present day in a straight forward way. I kind of left the Wes Anderson train back around The Life Aquatic but I can dig what he's doing."
759,How is he going to keep topping it?  Just show a picture of Bill Murray for half the movie then the second half will be a stop motion rat?
760,"He has been killing it in Barry lately, will be a nice addition here."
761,Come here. Good to see you. You know what? Don't get too close to me. 'Cause I've got an itch you can't believe. I think something laid eggs on me.
762,This exactly what I first thought when i saw the cast list. Winkler is a pretty good fit to Anderson's brigade.
763,Children's Hospital was clearly a Wes Anderson movie
764,They can’t charge a husband and wife for the same crime
765,He wasn't.
766,"Not to be that loser, but his actual name is Christoph, it's not shortened from Christopher :)"
767,"This year, all of the nominees except *Parasite* were ""historical.""  I guess this looks ""historical"" enough that it will do well in that category."
768,And cinematography
769,Not enough quirky dialogue though
770,and characters at the edge of the frame looking back at the camera
771,"meanwhile, let this classic SNL skit tide you over

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfDIAZCwHQE"
772,[Obligatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfDIAZCwHQE) but in all honesty they really kinda nailed his style with this parody.
773,Colour out of space might not be pastel enough for you but it might do for now
774,There's this AMAZING edit of [The Shining and Grand Budapest Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsi06PG7w_0) that really brings that all home.

778,"The dude dabbed in awards show, he is the true messiah"
779,"I keep seeing this mentioned, Twitter going crazy on chalamet. What's up with that? Is he just latest teen heart-throb or something?"
780,That's Wes Anderson's Holy Trinity.
781,Timothee Chalamet fits so well in Anderson’s style too which I totally did not see coming.
782,"They came up together. I tend to forget that Owen actually co-wrote Wes's first three films, which is crazy to think about when you realize that includes Rushmore & Tenenbaums."
783,Until the Grand Budapest The Life Aquatic was my favorite.
784,Watched Bottle Rocket for the first time last night and the dialogue was fantastic.
785,if Seydoux is what the typical prison guard looks like then I'm not surprised there's so many riots over there
786,...You’re absolutely right. Darn!
787,"She’s fragile, but not that fragile."
788,seydoux gave kojima and anderson a 2 for 1 deal.
789,she doesn’t seem like the type who would be open to nudity or sex in a movie though
790,"Ye fond of me penis, ain't yer ?"
791,I like to imagine his dick just making directors go mad. Like it's some kind of Eldritch God swinging between his legs. No director is capable of harnessing it for a scene. It almost killed Lars von Trier.
792,haaaaaark!
793,We can only hope...
794,In that case I’m a fan of his lobster ;)
795," Hark Triton, HARK! Bellow, bid our father the Sea King rise from the depths full foul in his fury!"
796,IIRC James ivory was pissed at that he wanted full graphic nudity to truly represent gay love. He thought the censored contracts restricted the movie
797,"Her being a Scientologist really turns me off to all of her work tbh, I'd like to see less of her. A small part in Wes Anderson, sure, I can be on board with that but I am ready for her streak to end. Drives me crazy that her ""banner"" role is her most hypocritical."
798,"2012/13 Jude Law I don't think I've seen a single movie from that period with him in it. 2004 Jude Law was in so much shit that he had to take a year off lol I Heart Huckabees, Alfie, Closer, The Aviator, Sky Captain, and Series of Unfortunate Events"
799,"Oh man, did you see Her Smell? Performance of the fucking year. She's amazing."
800,What’s the most impressive is she became really successful after mad men ended when she was in her 30s. It’s rare for a female actor to have success in films after years of doing tv exclusively especially in middle age. Choosing to do indie was prettt smart move it had her get a reputation of being an acclaimed film actress
801,"I'm sorry, Mr. Park!"
802,RESPECT!!!
803,Its so metaphorical
804,"The poster reminded me of Chris Ware's work (a Chicago ""comic book"" artist.)"

810,"There was that Christmas ad he made. It was very cute.


https://youtu.be/aXLO2dFfwLE"
811,Oh yeah that too.
812,But the thing that I really do love about Wes’ films is that you grow a little bit after experiencing that melancholy. Those few films where you really feel what the character is going through- I think that’s what makes his films so special.
813,The Social Dispatch

815,r/UnexpectedZuck
816,"Nothing will ever be more Wes Anderson than Budapest. That was peak Anderson from a stylistic standpoint. I found Moonrise Kingdom to be so painfully Anderson that it actually took me out of the story, and resulted in one of my least favorite Andersons. But Budapest was 100x more Anderson to the point where it got so ridiculous that it wrapped around and became amazing to me again.


But this looks *very* Anderson with some new tricks (black and white, rotating shots, anamorphic lens(?)) so I'm excited."
817,"It's funny how everyone has basically the same reaction, ""yup that's a Wes Anderson movie"". It makes sense, he has a style that draws attention to itself a lot. Personally that has never been my thing, but there are some nice looking shots I can't deny"
818,"I'll argue that currently JoJo Rabbit holds the title of the most Wes Anderson movie since the last, despite Wes Anderson not having anything to do with it"
819,"He does always have very particular cinematography. But there are some other directors with their own ""style"" that is distinctively noticeable. Edgar Wright jumps to mind."
820,Plenty.  Yasujirō Ozu was making movies that were distinctly his based on any single frame in the 1940s.
821,Edgar Wright and Tarantino I guess
822,"Fincher comes to mind, very distinct as well but in a more subtle manner.

Anderson's style is definitely the most ""in your face obvious"" though."
823,"[Roy Andersson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7pna4laaAk).

One need only see a single frame from one of his movies and you'll just know it's his."
824,Roy Andersson for sure. His films are just a series of still shots designed to look like paintings though so it's sort of cheating (though you could kind of say the same for Wes Anderson then).
825,"Like godbottle said, Wes is *heavily* inspired by Ozu. [It's most noticeable in the framing of his shots.](https://imgur.com/a/EGyaol3)"
826,Hitchcock
827,"90s Wong Kar Wai

but thats a lot to do with Christopher Doyle"
828,Michael Bay is to explosions as Wes Anderson is to gestalt
829,Michael Bay.
830,Thank you! It sounded fantastic.
831,If he released the trailer as a short film last year in time for the Oscars could he have it entered?
832,And Grand Budapest was wonderful. This looks great.
833,Grand Budapest was SIX years ago?? Good lord.
834,"> no one has successfully copied his style

If you sat me down and told me JoJo Rabbit was a Wes Anderson movie I would 100% believe you."
835,"> no one has successfully copied his style

i'm not gonna say they ""copied"" his style per se but more like they were inspired by it, but i definitely felt some heavy Wes Anderson vibes from Richard Ayoade's *Submarine* (a great underrated, underseen movie) and *Paddington 2*."
836,Mystery solved!
837,And being ridiculously good looking

842,"I want a Wes Anderson mob movie, now."
843,"We were conditioned to hide our love (for Wes) lest the irony squad find out we actually liked things. Now in the real world we can profess our love openly!

847,"I don't like Dunes. They're coarse, and rough, and irritating."
848,I have found my people.
849,His ensemble casts have always been great but this is a whole other level.
850,"Ehn... I don't really understand beyond silly people will be silly. 

If you don't like it in general, I get it, but is not like this is something everyone is doing, so how are you getting turned off by a style you only get to experience every 3 years? Specially when he is so good at it and constantly evolving and finding new ways to play. 

I mean, Grand Budapest Hotel was six years ago."
851,Micheal Bay says hello. You can spot his direction a mile away...and also get motion sickness at the same time.
852,"I love the cast too, but yeah I’m definitely one of those people who can’t stand his style. Might give this a shot based on the cast alone though."
853,there is something so warm and sentimental about all his movies.  they are like a nice bowl of chicken noodle soup.  not the most exciting but damn enjoyable and comforting.
854,"Yeah like, I'm not a big fan, but there are very few directors working today where you can see one still frame from one of their films and know instantly that it's theirs. Something to be said for that"
855,"I'm personally getting a little tired of his shtick, but respectfully. The man's still an incredibly talented filmmaker."

859,"*some* Rushmore Wes. It still looks narratively overstuffed, which after Isle of Dogs I was hoping he’d learn his lesson. Budapest is so good because even though it has a monstrous cast and the style is insane, it’s a shockingly tight story."

865,"Wes wit it, rock wit it."
866,The Ander-scenery?
867,"Good quote. I’ll be more specific I don’t want him to run in the opposite direction, I want him to retain his sensibility, but GROW it. Evolve it.

He can still give the same wit, and treatment of character but there are ways to add twists to keep it fresh.

Bottle Rocket rocket, for instance is of my favorite films of his. It’s so stripped back, but all of his hallmarks are there. Bottle Rocket does however feel as if it takes place in the real world and not just the “Wes Anderson Universe”. It’s little things like that that can help discern one film from another."
868,"Also his style actually allows for him to be more creative while keeping cost reasonable.

I recall a lot of scenes in moonrise where shot from the single perspective because the reverse shot of the scene didn't work.

It's like if you needed to film the Great Pyramids for a movie but didn't have the budget or ability to green screen out the Pizza Hut across the street. You'd just shoot the single perspective shot. Wes has just taken that ""box"" and kept exploring it. Forcing limitations on your art can force creativity in ways you'd never realize without restriction."
869,"Y'know, I'd probably watch that."

912,"That only makes me want some Anderson/Murray Scrooge more, though."
913,Great now I’m fully expecting the next Wes Anderson movie to just be a remake of Scrooged. And I’m going to be immensely disappointed when it doesn’t happen.

918,"Interesting, I think Moonrise was amazing, and hated Budapest."
919,"Interesting I love Moonrise, but I also love Wes to a fault"
920,"I was telling my wife this trailer exhibits what I like most about Anderson's live work compared to animation. His carefully crafted and artificial symmetry/asymmetry looks amazing in a real world environment because it feels like heightened reality, but in animation I found that style to feel so planned that it didn't bring the same joy"
921,Auteurs
922,First one that came to mind.
923,I mean I'm sure he could enter it but it would 1000% not get nominated
924,It indeed was.
925,My second favorite movie of all time
926,"It has a similar tone and visual style at times, but it's definitely not as meticulous and symmetrical as Anderson's films are."
927,There’s a reason some people call it Moonreich Kingdom.
928,She’s ethereal
929,really really really ridiculously good looking(･ัω･ั)
930,but why male models?

936,Doesn't Dune come out this year?
937,"There wasn't a single thing I liked about the trailer, and yet I'm still going to see it, and I'm still wickedly excited."
938,Isle of Dogs was 2018 tho
939,"The style has influenced other movies though? Most recently Jojo Rabbit which could pass for a Wes Anderson movie. Hell, it even ends with the main characters dancing. And to a Bowie song!"
940,rarity doesn't mean likeable. Style and preference is all subjective and things with strong taste or style can be off putting to some. Personally I love  but I could see how a person might think it's uninteresting or distracting
941,Six years? Damn... I hope I live long enough to see many more Wes Anderson movies.
942,And the same core cast
943,"Hi friend, reverse the parentheses."
944,"I'm pretty sure it's a Naked Gun reference, it definitely feels like a Zucker brother joke."
945,I CAN SEE THAT
946,Same.
947,O you!
948,"I mean there’s a reason Bottle Rocket feels stripped back. It’s cause it’s his very first feature-length directorial debut. So you’re not really asking for him to “grow” but return to his roots. I’m not saying that argument is without merit though. I think it’s perfectly reasonable to say that his quirks, stylings, and artifice (and I love them to bits) can get in the way of the story and make for a less immersive experience as the fancifully elements overwhelm

And I say this as someone who loves modern Wes. His moves are like watching an original fairytale and isn’t something I can readily find from other directors"
949,"I hear what you are saying, but he has evolved.

Into this.

He took his whimsical wit and made the whole world, architecture... even the frame of the picture behave in the same way. I think he just reached his peak style with Grand Budapest Hotel.

There are other writers, directors and TV shows, that were influenced and/or borrow a lot from Wes, that end up doing something closer to what you are saying. But he does things now that one else does.

So I while I would be interested in something stripped back, we will mostly be missing something unique like what this looks like."
950,"I think you just might not be a fan of Wes Anderson's visual style. As a person who is, it is pretty clear in my opinion that his style is growing and evolving, but just not in the direction you want it to. If you watch Rushmore, then this trailer, you see that the style has been pushed way more to it's extreme. Same thing if you look at Tenenbaums to Grand Budapest Hotel for exemple. He is testing the limits more and more, and to see a director of his calibre explore his style deeper and deeper is to me much more exciting than for him to cut back on it to become more conventional.

Plenty other filmmakers to watch if I want a more naturalistic style."
951,Those are balls.

981,What didn’t you like in the trailer? It got me fairly interested and excited for the story.
982,"I know, but that's animation. Besides, people are more used to seeing some more stylistic in that genre. It doesn't stand out next to contemporary films like Ruben Brandt, Collector, or Mirai, hell, next to something like Into the Spider-Verse, Isle of Dogs feel traditional."
983,"Is it good? I’ve got it on my watch list but not got around to it

Mainly because I love dogs (yes I know it’s puppet/animation type) and I can’t watch anything that might be sad in any way when it comes to dogs."

988,"You know, every movie that I see these days puts a dark mirror in front  of me and asks me to reflect on the terrible undercurrent of corruption and -ism and inequality in the world.

There's a real place for that.  Films that do this are important - not only for democracy, but for self-reflection and growth.  Parasite won an Oscar doing this, and it deserved it.  Great film.

But Jesus, Christ, everything has to be so down to earth.  Even the superhero films are grounded and depressing sometimes.

Wes Anderson's films take you away from this reality.  There's conflict, sure, but for a few hours there's real aesthetic beauty whisking you away from real world problems.  There's whimsy.  There's wonder.  But it all takes place in a parallel world that isn't quite this one.

And I just need it sometimes.  I need to be in that other world, because sometimes this one is simply too cruel or too uncivil or too same-y.

So please, Mr. Anderson, keep taking me away from this world on small journeys, because a movie theater is so much more convenient than spending the day at an art gallery."
989,"Personally, I hope he never does take his hand out of his films. It would be such a loss. I do want to see him do something chilling or spooky. Maybe a film version of an Edward Gorey book like, ‘The Hapless Child.’"
990,"I’ve been a fan of his visual style and followed it closely for years. I think Fantastic Fox actually revitalized him as a visual storyteller which gave way to how dynamic and kinetic Moonrise Kingdom was.

The films do differ visually to a degree. But they could easily be construed as different stories within a shared universe.

I’m just saying I’d love to look back at his career and see more versatile “phases”. Like I’d love to see him just grab a steady cam and shoot something totally in black and white, or do something that only takes place in one location.

Tarantino is great example of what I’m talking about. You couldn’t miss it was Tarantino for a second but even he spreads it out, so one film is a sweeping multiple location epic, the next is a 3 act play trapped in a single locale, the other is a twist on a non-fiction story. Even Tarantino is mindful to challenge his limits while still celebrating his sensibilities."
991,You are king of suck balls mountain.

995,"I was at a screening of Parasite that had that live Q+A after.

How was it listening to him (and his translator) talk about the film? Our stream only covered about half of the interview from what we could tell so I reckon we missed a good chunk of it overall."
996,And it wasn't even nominated!
997,He's also making his West End debut this year.  Kid is crazy busy.
998,"He's not it's Greig Fraser who shot Rogue One and Zero Dark Thirty. So the movies in capable hands, Fraser is also doing the Matt Reeves Batman movie."
999,"I feel like Driver *commits* to his SNL roles in a way that you don't often see from the guests. Like, watching that oil baron sketch, I now want to see him actually play an elderly oil baron in some kind of There Will Be Blood style movie. Undercover Boss just *is* Kylo Ren. He brought the exact same energy, with no half measures and no winking. It's amazing how much he doesn't hold back, on SNL or anywhere else for that matter."
1000,*LOOK AT ME BOY*
1001,The oil baron skit is one of the funniest things I have ever seen off of snl. The fact that almost everyone else breaks but he doesnt at all adds to it as well.
1002,New Christian Bale.
1003,"Darjeeling is still one of my favorite Anderson films if not my favorite. 

I am biased though as me and my two older brothers always get drunk and watch this together at reunions."
1004,Yeah I really like him. Hes an amazing actor with the right material
1005,Blue is the warmest colour
1006,Say it! Yer fond of me penis!?
1007,"Alright have it yer way, I like yer dick"
1008,You know what I mean?
1009,"That's a decent amount of Andersons, I too enjoyed it very much."
1010,"I felt it wasn't all that Japanese influenced, just on a superficial level. Felt more like the whole japan thing was just used to make the audience have the same language barrier that dogs have to humans. And the rest of the cultural references were just a bonus side effect."
1011,LoTR but all the elves are leprechauns.
1012,"Tenet has Hoyte van Hoytema. You're right that's tough. Dune has Greg Fraser who did Rogue One and Zero Dark Thirty, so that at least gives us a sense of what look they're trying to achieve with Dune. Rogue One is probably the *best* looking Star Wars movie in the Disney era."
1013,Is Deakins signed on to anything right now?
1014,There was that one shot of Jojo and his mum cycling across the horizon of a bright green field and turquoise sky that I thought was particularly Anderson.
1015,"""What's that K in the corner for?""


""That stands for Klaus."""
1016,"What I’ve found interesting about his films is they are whimsical/twee on the surface but mostly center around incredibly painful topics like mental illness, suicide, parental abandonment/death, war, etc. - almost all of his films are an iron fist in a velvet glove. So when I watch one of them, I’m seeing the darkness you’re talking about but with a cheerful facade."
1017,"You said it, man."
1018,"*every* movie you see these days makes you reflect on corruption and inequality?

maybe our brains are just wired different, but unless those are core themes of the movie im scarcely thinking of stuff outside of the film. surely there are loads of movies you've seen in the past few years (other than Wes Anderson films) that haven't made you think of that sort of stuff."
1019,"You seem to be conflating Tarantino's stories with his visual style. It being trapped in a single locale, or a non fiction story, has to do with the type of stories he is telling (and thank god he switched those up from the litany of revenge stories that he was doing before Hateful Eight) and not at all to do with how he visually prevents these stories.

Wes Anderson stories while they often do have thematic similarities (often about a person who believes in romantic values in a world that doesn't, as can be seen in Rushmore or Moonrise Kingdom for example) I can easily describe his films as one taking place almost all on a boat, another an stop motion film about foxes, or a story about an old hotel.

To me what you are asking is like wishing Hitchcock made less thrillers, or Cuaron to do a film with quick cuts instead of a long one take shots, or Jean Renoir to have forgone his indiosyncratic style for the sake of variety. In all these cases, these things are what made them stand apart from the rest and what makes us or will make us remember them. While repeating the same story isn't great (as I felt Tarantino was for awhile), switching a visual style when it is part of the fabric of the filmmaker isn't."
1020,"Maybe the cost to film in Korea is a bit lower. But yeah, it’s insane what they manage to do with such small budget"
1021,I should probably edit it yeah. Sorry if I spoilt it for you man
1022,"It was really good yeah, the translator is the same one they had for the oscars and was amazing at conveying his humour and it was really cool to have Song-Kang Ho (the Kim family dad there) to talk about his experiences"
1023,"Loved both those movies, with Rogue One being my favorite post-Disney movie. Having high hopes for Dune"
1024,Driver commits to his Bobs Burgers appearances.
1025,"His new SNL had a bunch of great skits. Even the dumb ones, like you say, he just *commits* to"
1026,He does kinda look like bale from machinist
1027,"I didn't care for it the first time I watched it, then watched it again on an airplane last year and fucking *loved* it.  Definitely top-tier Anderson."
1028,"Dick ye to Hell, Winslow!"
1029,I've seen it! You're fond of me dick!
1030,I felt a lot of the cinematography was very much a blend of Anderson's symmetry and Kurosawa's painting like sense of blocking. Also the set design and score definitely suggested it was more of a genuine appreciation for the culture than an artificial recreation.
1031,"""I asked for a sword and you hand me a breakfast cereal?"""
1032,"Nope, no 2020 films as of right now according to IMDB or Wikipedia"
1033,I don't disagree.  I'm just thankful for the velvet.
1034,"Well said, but it’s funny you mention Hitchcock because he did exactly what I’m talking about. Hitchcock for years made thrillers, became the “master of suspense. His budgets got bigger and bigger and bigger where he was making these dizzying, epics like Vertigo, and blockbusters like The Birds. He eventually grew to point where studios couldn’t handle the extravagance and demands that came with these stories to where Hitchcock nearly burned out.

Then, late in his career he decided to mix it up and do something totally unconventional and unprecedented by making a little film called Psycho.

Psycho, was a fraction the budget of his other films. It was all black and white. It was an almost schlocky horror/ proto slasher novel that wouldn’t have been immediately seeming to be something in Hitchcock’s wheelhouse. And yet, when it comes out completely changes the game and alters cinema as a business and as an audience experience forever.

He makes the film, which he demands audiences actually show up on time or be denied entrance ( unheard of at the time, people used to just show up whenever)

Then markets the film on a movie star, only to have them slaughtered, shockingly in the first 45 minutes. Makes it the first film to feature a toilet, and pushes boundaries on sexuality and inclusion of nudity in a mainstream film. After the film came out showing up to films on time became a norm BECAUSE of Psycho. And filmmakers were taught you take major risks on main characters to toy with audience expectations. 

Hitchcock zagged on his audiences in one of the most significant, major ways that ever occurred in cinema history way late into his career. It’s possible to do, and so rewarding when a director steps up and does it."
1035,Films cost way less everywhere outside of the states. American actors costs way more and the use of cgi is extremely cost prohibitive. How crazy is it that this beautifully shot movie cost less to make than Super Troopers 2?
1036,"Haha nah, it’s all good I’ve seen it. Honestly I don’t think it really ruins much even if you haven’t. Just thought it was funny."
1037,Looks like Bale from Little Women
1038,"I'm a dickie, and a dickie I is."
1039,"""How many lembas marshmallows have you eaten?""

""Four."""
1040,"Psycho came out 2 years after Vertigo and 3 years before The Birds.  It was made so cheaply because Paramount did not want him to make it so he made it with his television crew. Even so, Psycho is not markedly different from Hitchcock's style and more importantly Vertigo is widely considered one of the single greatest films of all time, so it's ridiculous to say he stepped up from it."
1041,"what are you trying to say about super troopers 2, partner?"
1042,Also kinda looks like a little woman.
1043,Not much except I loved the 1st one and fell asleep during 2. And that it cost more to make than Parasite.
1044,Bob Dylan?
1045,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there a plan for a 21 Jump Street/Men In Black crossover?

Do Lord and Miller get credit for a film not being made?"
1046,"I don’t get the hate for sequels since they don’t change the original work.

I often want to see more of a character or a universe. If the new story is good, then everybody wins. If it’s not good, we can just ignore it and keep liking the first one(s)."
1047,I think you're confused about why there weren't more sequels...
1048,"24 Jump Street is currently In the works and may lead to a spin off with Tiffany Haddish and Awkwafina. 

https://screenrant.com/24-jump-street-phil-lord/

https://youtu.be/ftenN87QA_w"
1049,I feel the exact opposite.  More movies please.
1050,You obviously don't keep up with what they have going on
1051,"Yes, and i believe a 3rd movie (not the MIB crossover) is still trying to be made."
1052,"Because most of the people on this sub are unoriginal  and keep parroting the idea that every film should be a one off original film and remakes/sequels/reboots/etc. are bad.

Its really annoying and comes off as dismissive and pretentious. 

Unless the film is a shot for shot, word for word, remake/adaptation it still has merit since its still creating something to be on screen. It doesnt ruin the original work by existing.

I have never heard someone say a good film is now terrible because it has a bad followup."
1053,"Yep, 24 Jump Street is apparently in development."
1054,and i’ll watch. if Lord and Miller direct of course
1055,Looks like 24 Jump Street is going to star Tiffany Haddish and Zendaya and be directed by one of the writers of 22 Jump Street.
1056,i’m out. can’t stand tiffany haddish
1057,"I think Alita would have been better as a full CG animated film.  The actress being completely CG looked awkward and was distracting the whole movie.

The directing was noticeably worse than Ghost in the Shell and the visuals were comparable.

Alita felt like a young adult novel movie, Ghost in the Shell was a dark gritty cyberpunk.

I quite liked Alita, but I don't see how you can say it was solidly better than Ghost in the Shell."
1058,"The problem with the live action Ghost in the Shell is that not only did they vastly dumb down the source material, but they also didn't really adapt the story, they made it more a knock off of Robocop. At least Alita actually adapted the story from the manga/anime, can't say the same for Ghost in the Shell."
1059,"Oh boy, directed by the guy who did A Ghost Story

hype"
1060,"Here’s a little bit [higher res](https://i.imgur.com/7DWdL7h.jpg) version of the poster! 

From IMDb: 

>	A fantasy re-telling of the medieval story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

Starring Dev Patel, Alicia Vikander, Joel Edgerton, Sarita Choudhury, Sean Harris, Kate Dickie, and Barry Keoghan. Directed by David Lowery (A Ghost Story). 

Dope poster, I’m super excited for this. Hop on over to /r/A24 as well if you get the chance!"
1061,That tagline font and orientation is incredibly hard to read.
1062,"I'm sorry, but the vertical lettering in whatever script that is was terrible. Whoever thought that would be a good choice for a poster layout confuses me. can someone just type out what that's supposed to say?"
1063,"Directed by David Lowery (A Ghost Story).
Looking forward to this."
1064,Is this a sequel to Green Book or Green Room?
1065,"Anyone know if this an adaptation of anything specific?
Always loved the legend of Gawain and the green knight."
1066,[And there was much rejoicing](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/IncredibleSevereFiddlercrab-size_restricted.gif)
1067,Lowery also did the charming The Old Man & the Gun 2 years go. I know there's only 12 of us who've seen it but still think it's worth mentioning.
1068,By ze lady?
1069,Hi all- BRON Studios here. Thanks so much for all of the kind words about the poster! We can’t wait for you all to see the trailer tomorrow.
1070,"FINALLY! 

This movie has been on my list forever. Really excited to see another David Lowery movie :)"
1071,"Love David Lowrey and the cast. Not usually into medieval movies, but I can't wait for this"
1072,Wow. Really good poster. I hope it's a good film.
1073,If nothing else that is a superb poster
1074,this poster is delicious
1075,easily in my top 3 most anticipated this year. David Lowery is a genius and among our finest working today. so excited to *finally* see what this looks like.
1076,One of my favorite books as a kid. I’m pretty sure Sean Connery did a rake on this in the 70s or 80s?
1077,[Textless version](https://i.imgur.com/XaS7oOv.jpg).
1078,Isn't there already a Sean Connery version of this story?
1079,The best thing about this is Finchy is playing the Green Knight.
1080,This is one of my most anticipated summer movies
1081,wow. that's a really intriguing poster.
1082,"At this point I don't even need a trailer. 
I totally trust A24"
1083,Love me some David Lowery. Definitely watching this.
1084,"David Lowery is directing (Ain’t Them Bodies Saints, A Ghost Story, Pete’s Dragon, Old Man and the Gun) so it’s going to look fucking beautiful. Can’t wait to see a trailer"
1085,"This looks pretty cool.

Dune trailer when?"
1086,A medival a24 flick? Colour me interested.
1087,Remember the version with Sean Connery?
1088,Aight time to butcher some Arthuriana
1089,I'm interested!
1090,Fun fact: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight was the movie we were supposed to be watching in my senior English class on 9/11. You had to have the TV set to channel 3 or 4 for vcrs to work and that's the the NBC station here. The teacher was having trouble getting the vcr to work and as we waited we saw the plane hit the 1st tower. The rest is history. Don't remember if we ever saw the movie.
1091,The Sean Connery version of this movie was weird as hell
1092,[nice poster](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/909/034/22b.png)
1093,"My absolute favorite Arthurian legend. Tolkien did a great translation. I could never bring myself to watch Sean Connery version. 

This poster and the director makes me thing horror-direction, but not sure that would make a ton of sense, save the grisly opening scene.

*I see the mom and dad from The VVitch are reuniting in this"
1094,"I mean this has pretty much become the standard in recent years, hasn't it? 

Poster today, trailer tomorrow.

Also, FOR ZE LADY!"
1095,Isn't Joaquin Phoenix going to be part of this as well? He supposedly just finished shooting a movie with A24
1096,Been waiting for this for a while. And by a while I mean 700 years.
1097,This is my favorite story ever. I'm fucking hyped.
1098,"I remember the awful Green Knight movie with Sean Connery. Ooooooh it was bad. I remember the actor who played Gawain was like a parody of handsome. He had a huge square jaw, pale white skin, flowing blonde hair. He was like a cross between a romance novel cover and Hitler's wet dream."
1099,I’ve never been to a Medieval Times.
1100,What does the text on the sides say My dyslexia doesn’t like it at all.
1101,sean harris...this guy can't escape medieval movies
1102,"*A24 farts*  
  
r/movies: OMG that smells so good  
  
EDIT: lol people on reddit can't take a joke"
1103,Marvel or DC??
1104,But he’s not wearing green!
1105,Holy Grail prequel
1106,"bad poster... sorry no hype from this.  No context or clue what its about from some random knight in profile with a foofy crown, incredibly hard to read text, desire to research further is minimal."
1107,Another 1?
1108,"No offense, but this does not look historically accurate (fiction or not) at all:

Cast

Dev Patel as Sir Gawain

Seriously?

Edit: and you can downvote, but it is still not accurate at all. That is a hard fact."
1109,Bro it's the black knights cousin
1110,Did A24 direct it?
1111,Can't wait for him to eat Green Eggs and Ham in a single take lasting 28 minutes!
1112,The Old Man and the Gun was great.
1113,With Martin Freeman? Easily one of the most disappointing films of the last few years.
1114,"> A fantasy re-telling of the medieval story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

I wonder if they'll lean quite heavily into horror territory with some of the more unsettling parts of the poem. I can see it either being a python-esque comedy, or a brutal psychological character study."
1115,"I hadn’t heard of this but Sir Gawain and the Green Night is one of the best medieval stories, and Dev Patel is incredible, so I’m suddenly really excited"
1116,That's quite the cast; I am hyped!
1117,Impressive design artwork.
1118,[this old classic again?](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/US1sheet.jpg/220px-US1sheet.jpg)
1119,"Sounds cool!

Barry *Keoghan* (pronounced kyohwan) is his surname."
1120,"Thanks, I wonder why mods let images with low resolution be posted here. I think a limit in minimal resolution should be setup to avoid this posts.(at least on posters posts)"
1121,"Great cast, I’ll check it out."
1122,Fucking. Pumped.
1123,damn it I had the idea for this movie years ago lol
1124,"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is easily one of my favorite knights of the round table stories, very excited for this!"
1125,DEV PATEL OOO
1126,My thoughts exactly. At first glance I didn’t even realize it was text. Then I did and wasted my time figuring out what it said.
1127,The poster would likely look better without it too.

1146,">:)

:)"
1147,March.
1148,Right?! I'm really curious to see the trailer for this
1149,It won't be a horror version. The script is floating around and it's more fantasy-romance leaning.
1150,That’s a different film!
1151,People like what they like. Nothing wrong with that either way you look at it.
1152,"I’m no movie snob, in fact I hate most movies. My favorite over the past year was Godzilla KOTM. 

But everything I’ve seen from A24 has been very enjoyable. I even liked Barely Lethal."
1153,"You're the outlier, then. I think the poster looks sleek and nice, though admittedly the vertical lettering is a little off-putting. Still, I like the contrasts and colors. I immediately wanted to know more about the project.

Better than seeing another low-effort mishmash of actors' faces against some generic city background with violet and orange coloring and *sparks,* or some shit."
1154,"I would imagine something to do with “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight”.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight"
1155,"You're aware that we're talking about a story where a mythical knight meets a giant who can remove his own head, right? Why would you possibly care if it's historically accurate? What is it accurate to? It's not a ""hard fact"" to say it's inaccurate, because there wasn't a real Gaiwan to match the casting to."
1156,"It says it’s a fantasy retelling, so I guess they can do whatever with the source and setting, including a more racially varied cast than some old movies.

But also you did have a lot of islamic movement through Europe in the dark ages (before the crusades were islamic attacks on europe), so who knows where lone knight errant equivalents might have ended up."
1157,"Poem regarding mythical lore =\= historical accuracy 

... lets not forget that Britain hasn’t been white since the Romans too. 

Must be awful picking your cinema outings based on your own subjective perception of history :("
1158,">No offense, but this does not look historically accurate

Who ever said that was meant to be the point?

>Dev Patel as Sir Gawain
>Seriously?

Oh no. You're one of those."
1159,"Gawain is typically portrayed as white, but African and Middle Eastern knights were on the Round Table in major Arthurian works as early as the 1200's.  I'm not aware of any stories including an Indian knight but the round table was far better traveled than knights of the period would actually have been.  Arthurian legend takes place in a distinctly ahistorical world where the Welsh conquered the Roman Empire, so having a more ethnically diverse group of knights than would have actually been found in the court of a 6th century King of the Britons isn't really the biggest historical discrepancy the story needs to contend with."
1160,"First name A

Last name TwentyFour

And yes."
1161,"No, with Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara"
1162,"Nope, you are talking about Ghost stories. It's a bit disappointing indeed, but some people enjoyed it

A Ghosty Story is an A24 movie, starred by Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck"
1163,An Arthurian psychological thriller? Yes please.
1164,It's the director of A Ghost Story so probably not a comedy
1165,"yeah i'm picturing a pythonesque thing too :D

1166,"Really, really solid cast all around. I haven’t heard of the story it’s based on before!"

1169,"can't wait for it to be rated low on IMDB because Dev Patel ""doesn't fit the character's origins"""
1170,Yeah and that poster is amazing.
1171,It seriously is! I’m really excited for this.
1172,"Thanks for the clarification, I corrected it!"
1173,"""When honor was everything"" & ""When courage made kings""

I personally blame it on the low res. At good quality it won't be hard to read."

1179,"Honestly, I even think the original script wouldn't be that horrible if it wasn't in a perfect vertical line. But yeah, that is a lot better than the actual image"

1181,Bluntman?
1182,It seems to be an adaptation of the medieval alliterative poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

1187,"It was more of a joke. I enjoy a lot of A24 movies, my favorite might be Good Time."
1188,"Not just the vertical lettering, ""the green knight"" in red?  Artistic maybe but doesn't work for me.  Maybe it is my cynical nature but I like my knights gritty and without the religious iconography.  Id take another Gladiator over noble crusaders any day."
1189,"Did read that, don't think I have ever heard of that fable.  Seen most if not all of the Arthurian movies but never bothered to read into it more.  Might be decent, if the purity and piety is not overdone, but with a halo on the poster I doubt that."
1190,"I mean, a greenskinned man is going to get his head chopped off and then he will walk over and put his head back on."
1191,"Read below, this is not something racist or subjective, take the fold out of your eyes. I mentioned it is as ridiculous as Ricardo Montalban as a japanese guy in that Marlon Brando movie and as stupid as Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in the Shell.

It actually resembles that campaign from Barnes & Noble about celebrating diversity that caused so much outrage.

But ok, I guess we can just wait for Leonardo Di Caprio to show up as Moctezuma in the next movie. I mean, why not? Let’s kill our subjective perception of history. 😆"
1192,"Im kinda with him. I still laugh about John Wayne being cast as Genghis Khan.

Im not outraged by it, but I am disappointed."
1193,"And then people ask themselves why that “nasty” Brexit happened?

What is next? Kelly Marie Tran as an aztec woman? 
Chris Rock as Christopher Colombus?
Brad Pitt as a mayan?

Give me a break guys. There is nothing wrong in creating new, innovative, and diverse characters, why not? I am interested myself to watch Dev Patel as Arjuna for instance, in a serious movie, the same way I am interested in Chris Rock in that new Saw movie, and I am not interested in seeing Brad Pitt anymore 😂

But, replacing characters to fit a narrative in fashion? That is what makes some people angry and creates a bad environment for everyone, and if it was the other way around it would not be tolerated."
1194,"Oh, gotcha. I never saw that one but it looks like it's good."
1195,"He also directed Pete's Dragon and The Old Man and the Gun so I wouldn't take A Ghost Story as indicative of the tone of every film he will do. Nevertheless, considering the tone of the poster and the fact that A24 picked it up rather than a bigger studio I'm inclined to agree that it probably will be more similar to A Ghost Story and definitely not a comedy."

1200,Thank you. I gave up on the second one when i tried to read it
1201,that's actually pretty cool and wallpaper-worthy. looks like Kanye West's next album.
1202,Could you remove the dude as well?
1203,Does the Green Knight have his own Megazord?
1204,Probably  Pete's Dragon
1205,C’mon C’mon.
1206,"Sure, I was a little thrown off by that too, but the Green Knight seems to be more of a secondary character so I think it's fine. And to my knowledge religion is still a major factor in medieval literature and the period itself, though I admit I don't know much about this particular story... I'm guessing that it will have a fair mix of both grittiness and religious subject matter. We'll see."
1207,Are you under the illusion that Sir Gaiwan was a real person?
1208,Or Ricardo Montalban as a japanese guy. God that was stupid and awful as fuck.
1209,">I still laugh about John Wayne being cast as Genghis Khan

Yeah, this isnt the same thing.

It's entirely possible Patel was the best audition. You cannot sit there and tell me that Wayne was the best audition for that role.

This is nowhere near the same situation."
1210,">And then people ask themselves why that “nasty” Brexit happened?

Are....you telling me that Dev Patel caused Brexit by **daring** to go against your deepest wishes that he not take this role?

>makes some people angry

Yeah, mostly people who dont know what they're talking about and can be left to yell into the void ;)"
1211,Exactly what is being replaced?
1212,if you want to watch Rooney Mara eat an entire pie in one take then ya it's good.
1213,It's gut wrenching
1214,"It’s really not a good movie. I love me some low budget melodrama, but this was a pretentious pile of fluff. Legit one of my biggest disappointments for a movie after being told by reddit it’s good."
1215,"Oh, I was under the impression The Old Man and the Gun was also serious. Still need to see it"
1216,"I love how that short preview shows everything while telling nothing, its gonna be great!"
1217,"And Dunkirk! Smaller role, but I still thought he was good in it."
1218,"After looking at the high res, I will concede that it just isn't easy to read, but also it does look fantastic aesthetically the way it is."
1219,"Yes, but you'll be more likely to remember the tagline now after having put in the effort to read it. This coming from a death metal fan who discerns band logos as a lazy afternoon pastime."
1220,It's not bad. It's meant to be that way.
1221,Yeah but it's a great way for someone to stop and stare at your poster for a bit. It's a visually striking poster and the tagline is interesting so I'd want to watch a movie like that.
1222,The Yeez Knight.
1223,Yes but he has to play a flute-sword to wake it up.  And do a dance with a lot of high-stepping.
1224,"""I'm guessing that it will have a fair mix of both grittiness and religious subject matter. We'll see.""  I agree, maybe it'll be worth seeing after the trailer.

But I have to point out that while I have a problem with the religious aspects, which is purely personal, and you reply that ""to my knowledge religion is still a major factor in medieval literature and the period itself"" While other downvoted posts in this thread talk about it not being historically accurate and people reply to that with its a FABLE so it doesn't NEED to be historically accurate.. Jumping through hoops and double standards man...  Funny"
1225,"No, but the time period was, and you know what I mean (I hope). 😏"
1226,"Also, Genghis Khan was an actual person. This is based on a poem."
1227,"Again, if you would live out of the first world countries you would see it is exactly the same, and that is what I am trying to explain too. We don’t need white saviours, we need our minirity people to stop invading and trying to replace white people’s stories because it comes with the same backslash and looks as ridiculous as that John Wayne situation. 🤷🏻‍♂️"

1229,"He's upset that white people are ""disappearing"""
1230,"> after being told by reddit it’s good.

It is perfectly fine if you didn't like it.  [But it was not just reddit saying it was a good movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Ghost_Story#Critical_response)"
1231,Strangely enough. I would describe it as wholesome
1232,It kind of is? Definitely not a comedy but it’s not dark/gritty.
1233,"It kinda falls into the dramedy category. Not a straight comedy by any means, but definitely has some funny moments."
1234,Yeah as everyone else said it's certainly not an outright comedy but it's a completely different tone compared to A Ghost Story.
1235,Yeah really liked him in Dunkirk! He's amazing in an Irish film called Mammal too though the film is pretty bleak.
1236,I think it's just the letter 'e' needs to be a tad more distinctive and it would be ok.
1237,Kanye is King
1238,"Haha, yeah like I said I haven't ever read it and am not personally that familiar with it, so I don't know how heavily religion is portrayed in that story. I'm just aware of how important of a factor it played in everyday life at the time, but fables certainly don't always dive into that sort of thing."
1239,What year does Gawain and the Green Knight take place in?
1240,There will be a greenskinned man who survives decapitation in this film

1242,">Brexit is a reality.

Please keep touting the global embarassment that is Brexit as a victory. 

Its wildly entertaining to hear you be so proud of when the UK announced they were going to drop their pants and shit themselves and then took 4 years to actually do it."
1243,"Yeah, the c looks like an e, which also looks like a t. Also an r, lol."
1244,"Buddy, I’m mexican, this is not a racist thing, it just can’t be. 

I am speaking as a minority that wants this crap to stop and want people to embrace their own cultural and diverse background and leave stories that belong to other people alone. Dev Patel does not need to replace white characters to be good, accepting it is accepting that only stories foreign to his heritage are good, it looks as ridiculous as The Rock as Hercules you know? 😏"
1245,"In my case it has nothing to do with white and proud, it just cannot be about it you know? 😆

It has to do with not being utterly stupid. 

And why is Dev Patel so interested in white roles and not in indian roles anymore coming from an extremely rich and diverse cultural background? 
India has a very big (and bad) history of caring too much about not being as white as they would love to, skin tone is extremely important for them, I know about it, I lived with an indian woman. This is just another consequence of the invasion they suffered, trying to culturally replace the oppresor, to get some payback, and it is dead wrong, it makes things worse. To each its own.

So what now? Since I do not agree with your crusade are you guys going to start educating the ignorant mexican that lives south of the border? 
Because only white boys know what is politically correct right my saviors? Typical white boys. Just fucking typical. 😏"
1246,"I don’t care, I am not british, in fact, I belong to a minority, you would be surprised to know which one, and still I am against cross-cultural replacements because they create an awkward and uncomfortable feeling that ends in those racial responses, and anyway, the world is so rich, Dev Patel’s culture is SO vast and big that even I can imagine millions of ways to put him in an amazing movie without insulting him with “reverse-white washing” techniques and without trying to be “original” without looking just polemical, but ok, people don’t seem to get it for some reason."
1247,"I mean, Mexicans can be racist. 

Gawin is not a white character. He is a fictional character. He's not an Anglo character, he's a mythical character. He's maybe an English character, but so is Dev. But Gawin has no placement in any kind of history or real racial group. He's a myth. 

And of course Dev doesn't need this role to be good. He is good, which is how he got this role. 

The Rock as Hercules would be awesome. Heck, I can't imagine why it would possibly matter to have a Greek God have slightly brown skin. This is silly."
1248,">without insulting him

Now you're tripping over yourself trying to backpedal, trying to tell me that you were ACKSHUALLY worried about Patel the whole time.

Dude, the number of people you're fooling with that is less than zero.

>I don’t care, I am not british

And yet the inexplicable focus on Brexit. If I look in your post history, I bet I'd find shit about the ""GrEAt RePlACeMenT"" too."
1249,"Oh wow! “Mexicans can be racist”. Jesus, ok champ!

Let’s just educate those bad and ignorant mexican racist bigots!"
1250,"I’m mexican, you asshole. You most probably are a white knight fighting for the good causes (typical anglo), a Kevin Costner in Dances With Wolves, well I am not, I don’t have that privilege and I am not crying about it or pretending to have an open mind. There is just no way I can be racist because racism has been directed towards me my whole life, something that, if we are assuming like you did, most probably has not happened to you at all. I am the minority here and I am explaining why these things are just nocive.

What I am saying is something most people around the world realize, if you would live in the third world you would see it, no one wants to see this “polemical” things, because they do not make any sense (they really don’t and here we just laugh at american things like this and just say “ah estos gringos con sus mamadas de nuevo”) and they do make things worse in white countries, and if you do not believe me then look at the box office numbers for “woke” content. Numbers don’t lie. You guys really don’t understand do you?"

1253,Yes! Loved George McKay in ‘1917’. ‘1917’ will do so much for the careers of him and his co-star Dean-Charles Chapman.
1254,She really impressed me in The King. Looking forward to see what she does next.
1255,"Just watched 1917 again last night and I got into his performance so much more. I'm excited to see how he does in the future. He's definitely got talent, I just hope it doesn't get wasted with the wrong projects."

1260,"My grandmother took me to see The Lion King in 1994, we got the times mixed up, walked in to the theatre, sat down about 20 minutes from the end thinking we'd missed the beginning, credits rolled."
1261,I turned the tv on saw a movie was about to start. Russell Crowe appeared almost immediately and I thought “oh is this Noah? Maybe I’ll watch it”. And it just got weirder and weirder and I was just baffled trying to figure out what kind of interpretation of Noah’s Ark this is. About 20 minutes in I realized I was watching Man of Steel.
1262,"Back in the early days of YouTube, before the lawyers descended, people would upload entire movies in 10 minute chunks cause that was the limit at the time. I remember watching Predator that way and my wife was like ""don't you have that on DVD?"" I was like ""yeah but it's on YouTube."""
1263,"I once made out with my girlfriend while she watched Billy Madison. She would back away and laugh every couple of minutes. I couldn't be mad at Sandler, but goddamnit, I just wanted to put my tongue in her mouth."

1266,I watched all three hours of *Heat* through a 360p illegal streaming site playing on my Nintendo DS' 5.3 inch screen.
1267,Obligatory “not a movie but” I did once leave the theatre at a play’s interval thinking that it was over. Turns out that plays aren’t typically 90 minutes long.
1268,I forgot to turn on subtitles when I watched District 9 so I had no idea what any of the aliens were saying for the entire movie. Still really enjoyed it though.
1269,Started half way? how? Did the file come in two parts? Did the disc launch at the middle?
1270,"I watched possession with it shutting off every 10 minutes after the halfway mark because the file was corrupted or something. 

It was aids to power on through but I did it."
1271,"Not a movie, but I started season 2 of Marvelous Mrs. Maisel thinking it was the first season, and I just assumed in started in the middle of the story due to the flashbacks in S2E1. Got about halfway through S2E2 until I felt like something was definitely off."
1272,"Downloaded an Estonian film and the subtitles didn't work. Watched it anyway with zero idea what was happening.

Also a few times if I'm reaaally not feeling a movie, I'll speed it up on VLC because I'm too stubborn to just bail on it. Actually maybe that's more of a pro tip"
1273,"When I first signed up for Netflix, when it was just a DVD service, I requested The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2. I quickly devoured and loved the first one, so I went to put in the second and realized that Netflix had only sent me the second disc. So I figured ""oh well I'll just stream the first half of the movie"" and I quickly noticed that none of the Vito sections were subtitled. I figured that it was like the restaurant scene in the first movie where you're supposed to be able to follow what's going on just based on facial expressions and visual context, and I spent about 2 hours resenting the movie because I had no idea what was happening, until I swapped to the DVD and saw subtitles for all the remaining Vito sections. 

So I guess the short version would be that I spent most of the runtime of one of the greatest movies ever made hating the movie because I chose a bad online stream."

I would’ve prefer to just sit there and watch the movie. From then on, I realized..unless you’re in deep relationship with a girl, it’s not wise to choose going to see a movie for a date."
1277,"I’ve got an hilarious high school story about this. Me and two pals got talked into watching a movie on edibles called Adaption with Nicholas cage about a police man fighting internally with his disassociating other personality, the duality of the human spirit. 

It was a surrealistic study into absurd mental decline... we thought. 

Until we honestly realized we were fucking high morons and it was about two twins where one is just an asshole and how it kinda escalates regarding that."
1278,I think 2 or 3 times I've started watching either Jupiter Ascending or Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets thinking I've seen the other one but not entirely sure which one I've seen. I've definitely seen both but I kept forgetting if I've actually seen one or the other.
1279,"Huge fan of half baked. First decade or so that I was watching it, I was watching a VHS copy I taped off of comedy Central. All those years I really believed thurgood said, ""what's that stuff?

And that's why, to this day, I call pussy puddin'."
1280,"As a man with mild adult ADHD, I can't stand watching movie too long no matter how good the movie is so I have this trick to always open 3 or 4 screens for different movies.

1281,"There's apparently a Disney+ bug some people have experienced that set default language to Dutch or something else non-English. My buddy watched the entire first episode of The Mandalorian in Dutch, assuming the characters were speaking Mandalorian.

1282,"not a movie but my wife and I watched the last episode of Westworld. Waited for every show to air so we could binge. So I'm confused on what's going on. She's confused on what's going on and I say to her,""Ya, but you know this show is weird. We'll figure it out."" Previously she had stated she thought we fucked up but I would not be swayed."
1283,My family and I watched side 2 of the Amedeus dvd first. Still dont know how none of us figured it out until the end but I was young so that's my excuse.
1284,"I watched a movie on Netflix (Take Me to the River, I recommend it), and the aspect ratio is 2.35 : 1. When I watched it, I had not seen any trailers or knew that was the ratio, and when it started, I was instantly taken aback because the bottom black bar was about 50% taller than the top one. Logically I thought ""something's wrong here"", but after a minute, I was kinda into it and thought this must be an intended artistic choice since Netflix has never messed up for me in any way like that, and I just watched the rest. Nope, randomly watched the trailer sometime later, and it was simply 2.35. Went back to start it again on Netflix and it was normal like in the trailer. Felt like an idiot. At least I didn't miss anything, the frame wasn't actually being covered, it was just higher up on my television. Very odd. Now I'm wondering if a film has ever been purposely presented/framed like that for whatever reason."
1285,"Back in the day, I rented Stephen King’s IT double VHS. And, someone didn’t put the tapes back correctly, so I watched part 2 before part 1. Thought “well, that was a fine ending, what could possibly be on tape 1?” 🙃"
1286,"Had to watch a foreign movie in class with subtitles in a different language than the film, so that was zero help."
1287,"On New Year's Eve, my friends and I watched a bootleg version of the new *Cats.* Honestly, the blurring and multilingual gambling ads were a big improvement."
1288,I watched Dunkirk after barely sleeping for 2 days. That movie is supposed to be gripping and immersive. I slept through half of it.
1289,"I once watched a thematically accurate version of Captain Philips that was missing the Somali-to-English subtitles. At first I thought it was an incredibly bold creative choice, to keep the audience as nervous and in the dark as the ship passengers, but after it went on for like 5-10 minutes with no Americans in the scene I knew something was amiss."
1290,"I watched Spider-man, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, and the 2010 Avengers cartoon on Netflix on my 3DS. Among other things."
1291,"My dad and I watched Dragonfly (w/Kevin Costner) from a point about 45 minutes in by mistake. Somehow it seemed like a complete story and we were like, “That was a short movie.”"
1292,I watched Interstellar but not in theatres.
1293,"Not me, but my mom once watched Fight Club and turned it off with 20 or so minutes remaining. She said ""I don't get what the big deal is, this movie is dumb""

Movie stupidity runs in the family though. When I was a teenager, I watched Seven for the first time. I'd gotten it on DVD, and about halfway through I got a little bored and started reading the titles of the DVD chapters. One of them, near the end, was titled 'Her Pretty Head.' Needless to say, all surprise was nixed.


Oh also when I was a kid I went to see the Lion King and went to the bathroom during the scene when Mufasa got trampled. When I came back, Simba was just staggering around in the desert. I asked my mom what happened while I was gone but she didn't answer. So the rest of that movie was confusing as hell."
1294,"As David Lynch once said ""It's fucking stupid that you can watch a movie on a cellphone"". So I think that all the times I've watched good movies on my phone was stupid."
1295,"Someone switch the reels around when I watched Possession. It's already a weird movie, but that made it a *really* weird movie. Didn't even notice what happened until I went back to watch it a second time."
1296,"I saw the First 20 minutes of Jurrasic world twice. I got a ticket for 3D at 730 but walked into a 2D showing that started at 7. I kept thinking ""man this 3D sucks!"" Then looked at everyone else there and realized I was the only one with 3D glasses. I had the lame privilege of watching those kids getting to the park twice."
1297,"I once decided that i have to watch The Godfather. I saw an hour and a half without understanding anything an then realized i was watching The Godfather III. I started the first film right away and didnt enjoy it because 3 and a half hours of Godfather in a row was a bit too much for me.
 To this day I'm scared to try again."

One night my dog had to go out to pee while I was watching Jacob's Ladder. I didn't want to stop the movie, so I copied the file over to the Zen, and head out the door.

It's after midnight and I'm standing outside in the pitch dark, and I get so engrossed in the movie that I forget that it's after midnight and I'm standing outside in the pitch dark.

I just about had a heart attack once I looked up and realized where I was."
1302,I used to watch episodes of Dr who on my OG Nintendo DS using an R4 card hahaha.

1304,"I would convert movies to watch on my og Zune.

Loved that thing."
1305,Bit shitty of the cinema staff not to give you guys a heads up
1306,"Oh man I miss all that stuff. And the suggestions in the sidebar would be different people's videos of the same movie, so you click what you think is the next part except it's a different channel and it's like 5 mins out from what you just watched. Good times."

1316,Wait...you thought that Donald's screenplay was the plot of the movie?
1317,"I had a kid a few years ago and have since seen dozens of movies on my cell phone, grabbing time whenever I can. Absolutely nothing wrong with it."
1318,If you hold it right up to your face it's almost like you're at the theater.

1325,Yeah somehow almost Mouth of Madness-esque
1326,"I'm not saying it's bad, but if it's possible to watch on a TV that's always the better route. I've watched some great movies on my phone (like *American Psycho* which I watched on a plane to Florida."

1332,"2003 was an amazing year for me as a fan of  films, Thanks in no small part to working at a little place called Blockbuster and a filmmaker named Park Chan wook and his movie *Oldboy*. I quickly found a copy of *Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance* and knew I had found something special. Not long after I found myself loving *Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring*, and then *Tale of Two Sisters*. A new world of unique perspective and tales of the human condition were suddenly opened up to me, and I've been in love ever since.

I was really excited to see Bong and Korean cinema get some mainstream/hollywood recognition and to see this ""new world"" of storytelling be opened up to so many more lovers of film. I've been a fan since *the Host* which I find to be an amazing time and a lovely take on the monster genre. And *Parasite* truly is an amazing film and deserves recognition on the world stage."

1338,"Oldboy is a straight thriller, it's very very violent but it never tips into horror."
1339,"You’re good to go.
It’s a “mindfuck thriller” in my opinion and has no horror at all, just some probable shock value here and there."
1340,"It's not a horror film at all.

It's just an extremely harrowing, extremely disturbing thriller that has some pretty horrific themes thrown in. Think a super r-rated revenge film with some amazing action sequences and some truly wonderful twists."
1341,"It’s really not a horror at all. More like a very tense thriller/mystery, so I think your dad would enjoy it"
1342,It’s just extremely violent and graphic.  Brutal. A fun viewing.
1343,"I would say it's definitely not a a horror movie.

It's more of a psychological thriller akin to Silence of the Lambs."
1344,"It's not horror.

>The two of us have watched and both enjoyed things like Seven, The Silence of the Lambs, Saw, and Zodiac.

Based on those, you and your dad gonna enjoy Oldboy too."
1345,It’s not horror but it can be graphic like horror films.
1346,Thanks for the help everyone. This is basically what I was expecting. Looking forward to checking it out.
1347,The plot twist is very shocking and disturbing so prepare for that.
1348,This ^
1349,"Shit, even I was uncomfortable watching it with my dad once it got to that reveal."
1350,???
1351,What? You’ve seen the movie right? It made our skin crawl and we were both equally uncomfortable 🤷🏼‍♂️
1352,"I’ve said this 100 times and it’s often overlooked.  Cameron construction of the screenplay is brilliant.  To use modern research hunters showing the audience how it sank before it happened in the movie was great storytelling.

Furthermore no other filmmaker on the planet could’ve made this movie."
1353,"I would take out “some other adjectives that I can’t think of” for starters.

“The ginormous Titanic, the seamless CGI shots of the Titanic”: I would use a different adjective than “ginormous” and instead of the second “Titanic” I would say ship, things like that would improve how it comes across. You could say something like “you feel the breathtaking size of the ship and the seamless CGI creates an incredibly realistic experience” just as one example. 

Your enthusiasm for the film comes across which is great."
1354,What do you guys think of my review? Open to any criticism to improve.
1355,"Don't use words like 'ginormous' and 'iffy'. Also try to stay away from adverbs, it's lazy writing when overdone. And ' the single most infamous tragedy of humankind' is hyperbolic. How about the holocaust?"
1356,"Letterboxd has been my go to for years now. It’s pretty incredible how easy it is to find cool films from browsing lists, by genre, by decade, by year etc.

Only thing that I don’t like about it is the vocal tumblresque community. At least they stay away from older films for the most part.

Edit: Also, If you get pro you get a snazzy [stats page](https://letterboxd.com/cymro2011/stats/), which I really dig. Kinda encouraged me to get into older films to balance out the 'By Release Year' bar and recently, watch stuff from different countries to fill in the world map."
1357,None.
1358,Imdb but I adjust them for the type of movie and how long it has been out. I'll watch a six in genres Im a big fan of  but need higher for others. New films ratings tend to be higher than equivalent older ones
1359,"Metacritic. I prefer their method of ""rate it from 1 to 100"" rather than RT's ""Do you approve or not?"""
1360,"I typically don't use any ratings site. I'll just watch teaser, trailer, & final trailers to get a idea if I want to see it or not. Not by someone else's biased point of view."
1361,"I follow 2 critics I like and understand, so none I guess."
1362,"> Like everyone else I always check a movie rating before deciding whether to spend the next 2 hours watching it or not.

Not everyone else but some and some only use those sites occasionally. I don't check them at all. For examples my sources or tools are:

* written articles

* top lists such as TSPDT, Sight & Sound, AFI, Roger Ebert's great movies list

* director's body of work (if large I narrow it down first using online sources)

* certain critics' highly rated films

* Youtube videos such as Cinefix top videos and Mark Kermode's best of the year videos

* word of mouth (friends or people online)

* festival winners

* Oscar winners (best picture, cinematography, foreign)

It doesn't take much convincing for to want to see a film if the source is a good one. After I've decided to watch a film (and added it on my watchlist) I avoid trailers, conversations, articles, etc. until I've watched it."
1363,"I don’t 

Edit: actually I do add films with high Letterboxd ratings on watchlist. Don’t go with IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes.

IMDB is so hugely effected by recency bias and the ratings seem to be very heavily skewed by popularity.

Rotten Tomatoes is the worst, if 100% of the critics give a film more than a 5/10 then it will have 100% on The tomato meter even if no one gives it a 10/10."
1364,Dvdsavant is a good one
1365,">""Imo IMDB > RT & the others because of the sheer number of audience reviews instead of solely hardcore critics but I don't know really.""

I use both IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. IMDb to get an idea of how enjoyable film is, IMDb reviews and Rotten Tomatoes to get an idea on whether it has something unique to it and what film's strong suits are (you can see from the summary and the snippets how film is praised).

>""Not sure about the biased part though, why would the average joe leaving a simple review or rating on imdb be affected by bias?""

IMDb ratings come from people that use IMDb, and some people use it more than others. For example, there are more folks aged 18-29 than 30-44 (more than twice) and there are twice more males. Those inequalities definitely affect the scores, e.g., people find different things interesting at different ages. Some films will be overrated, some underrated.

Also, IMDb scale is to measure some overall satisfaction with the film, but a lot of artistic and art-house films are notable not because they are overall great but because they are different kind of cinema itself, or different kind of storytelling, or different kind of cinematography, etc. It may have some 6.8/10 IMDb rating and you'll say to yourself 'not bad but nothing special, and premise is so-so, I can find something better' - when in fact that film is unlike anything else you'll ever see. Those kinds of films you're more likely to spot using RT Tomatometer or individual reviews (including IMDb reviews)."
1366,"For new movies I just find someone on youtube who has the same general tastes as I do. Even professional critics will have a natural bias. Chris Stuckmann and Jeremy Jahns are usually pretty on point with their reviews and are both good at avoid spoilers. 

For older movies I tend to use IMDB since it generally has a higher amount of separate ratings. Especially for super obscure movies, a lot of crappier movies have high ratings on RT because the 3 people who rated it are doing so because they specifically sought out that movie. In general which ever website has the highest voting population will be the best to go with.

For me I generally don't watch anything rated under a 6 on IMDB. Then if it is rated 6 I only watch if it is relatively short (a crap 90 minute movie is better than a crap 180 minute movie) or if it something I really want to watch."
1367,IMDB usually. I'll read through a number of users reviews and see what the consensus is. Wish I'd checked Jay and Silent Bob Reboot before watching it on sentiment and nostalgia alone 😂😂
1368,"General > IMDb

Less mainstream > used to check MUBI and Fandor

See the ratings to map my expectation."
1369,"Fandango usually has the RT score and an audience score side by side. I'll check those ratings before deciding whether to see a movie in theaters or not. If I'm just streaming something at home I'll usually just go by the trailer, but if I'm still unsure then I'll use IMDB"
1370,"I look at IMDB which has the meta score on the same page, so that way I see what the general audience thinks as well as the critics. But at the same time, if I want to watch a movie and it interests me, I’ll watch it anyway and make my own mind up about. Ratings and reviews can just help when I’m not sure about a particular movie."
1371,"Filmweb and RT.

Filmweb tends to have lower ratings than Imdb, which sives out fanboy ratings. They also added separate viewers general ratings and critics general ratings, also allowing you to see which critic gave it a specific grade, which is a great feature. *(sometimes I do compare Filmweb ratings with Imdb though, when I suspect they're too low, like in case of ""Hot Girls Wanted"" and ""Snowpiercer"".)*

I check RT for critics and it helps me judge how well made a movie is, so I can fully appreciate it."
1372,I just wait for Half in the Bag reveiws
1373,"I dont, I just log onto Troma Now and look for something I havent seen yet."
1374,IMDB but it doesn't decide if I will watch a film or not unless it's horribly bad and also not my type of film.
1375,"I look at a few facts like who made the movie, where it is from, running time, etc. I then go to rotten tomatoes and read the reviewer comments (both good and bad). Sometimes I get it from external sources like fresh air on NPR (i.e. that turned me onto Parasite)"
1376,"If it's a movie I'm not hyped for and I need to pick between a few, I'll glance at Rotten Tomatoes audience score, nothing more and go from there. If it's at home and not a theater, I'll pick whichever has the lowest run time cause free time is non existent in my life now."
1377,"For new releases:

Trailer usually comes first, followed by IMDB for films that have just released to get a general idea. Then perhaps a few reviews if I need to see justification for why a movie is rated particularly low (say below 7 if I expected it higher).

If a film is rated decent and above (say 7 or higher) I'll generally try and make time to see it at the cinema. Exceptions are movies with particular actors or themes I like and will see regardless of score.

I use RT additionally if it's not an obvious decision.

I have a rough idea in my head what I expect each movie's score to be and work around that."
1378,"[Filmaffinity](https://www.filmaffinity.com/) is my go to site. I always find IMDB scores swollen and this site use to have more accure ones. It started in spanish but now it has full english support. I really recommend it.

Also it has a soulmate thing where you can find people with similar scores and that's a fantastic way to find movies that people with similar taste like."
1379,none
1380,Rt and flixter
1381,I don’t use ratings. I just go on JustWatch to see what movies are available
1382,"I follow a couple different reviewers on YouTube as well as 4 pop culture/film-based podcasts; however almost all of those people are American, Canadian or British so there are some movies, usually European ones, they never see or review that come out in Spain where I live. As such, I also check out Rotten Tomatoes and I always read the highlighted comments or I look for critics I know from places like The AV Club. I might be weird because I usually focus on reading the negative reviews if it's a movie I know nothing about (I do the same on Goodreads) because there are things that some people will have issues with that I won't and other things that some people have no problem watching that will bother me. I like checking lots of different sources because everyone is bringing different viewpoints and backgrounds to their viewing habits. I recently joined Letterboxd too and I'm kind of obsessed. 

If it's a movie I'm very excited for, I'll just go see it though and will usually avoid reviews until after I've seen the movie. 

There is no reviewer or critic whose impressions line up perfectly with mine, ha, but I put a lot of stock in the opinions of Dan Murrell and Roth Cornet from Screen Junkies. I think they give things a fair shake and they spend a fair amount of time explaining their thoughts which I appreciate. If they say a movie is worthwhile, I'll probably at least give it a try. That's how I ended up seeing Jojo Rabbit (a movie I was pretty iffy on based on the premise) and 1917 (I can count on one hand the number of war movies I've seen) and I liked Jojo and LOVED 1917. It's not perfect - I couldn't get into Dolemite is my Name - but nothing is."
1383,Imdb
1384,A don’t read reviews watch it decide yer self most reviewers know fuck aw
1385,Any rating that isn’t an online audience score.
1386,"They did start out pretty decent, but the subculture spawned of trying to outwit each other is rather appalling."
1387,">the vocal tumblresque community   

I've never been on Tumblr, what does that mean? Do you have an example?"
1388,So where do you find films to watch?
1389,"Fair point, I respect that. Not sure about the biased part though, why would the average joe leaving a simple review or rating on imdb be affected by bias?"
1390,"I agree with your sentiment on Rotten Tomatoes, the binary rating scheme is pretty horrible."
1391,"Ouch thats rough haha, unlucky man."
1392,IMDb has an issue with movies starring black people
1393,"Kinda hard to put into words but I guess I can boil it down to there being a lot of obnoxious personalities and a few too many 'woke' feminists for my liking. They're not a big group of letterboxd users but they are very vocal.

Maybe the 5 star reviews of [Ghostbusters 2016](https://letterboxd.com/film/ghostbusters-2016/reviews/by/entry-rating/) will shed some light on what I mean."
1394,You can find movies very easily without looking up reviews
1395,"Netflix, shops, trailers/adverts, other people/word of mouth, if I like an actor I'll usually try another one of their films, directors are similar though I know less directors, book to film adaptations

Point is I've seen a lot of films and have never really looked at rating sites before watching. Its more fun to do it afterwards imo"
1396,"I look at what's in the theaters, read what the movie is about, cast etc.

But I don't check sites like rotten tomatoes etc. They're just like Amazon reviews."
1397,"Well their point will be biased no matter what. It is their opinion on the movie, and shouldn't sway me one way or the other from my opinion on seeing the movie or not."
1398,uh can you expand on that?
1399,"Yup, as soon as there is a specific online activist community who feels strongly about a film, the IMDB score becomes meaningless."
1400,I totally agree. Generally these are the highest rated reviews right? Thats the only thing I don't like about the app. I wish I could always sort reviews by recent on mobile.
1401,"I know, I'm just curious about where they find films to watch."
1402,"Ah yeah aha didn't think of it like that, fair enough man."
1403,">highest rated reviews right?

yeah

on the app it sorts by review popularity by default and then you can sort by most recent if you click the settings on the top right. It is a pain having to do it every time though."
1404,At the local cinema/streaming service of choice.
1405,La Isla Minima (Marsh Land) is a decent detective/procedural thriller.
1406,I enjoyed Toc Toc.
1407,I quite liked “The Invisible Guest” [2016]
1408,"Any film by the director Álex de la Iglesia.  The last films of him, ""El Bar"" and ""Perfectos desconocidos"" are very good."
1409,Not sure quite how old it is but the movie The Fury of A Patient Man is excellent and reasonably recent
1410,Amores Perros.. it's much older. But still a great movie
1411,"Not from the last two years, but have you seen El Metodo? (The Method).

Amazing contained character film that all takes place during a group interview for a job."
1412,"Quién a hierro mata. ""Eye for an eye"" it's a good drug Thriller."
1413,"In the great category there is **El Reino** by *Rodrigo Sorogoyen*. It's a political thriller, but a particularly well made one. The art of tension is mastered, so many scenes are ambitious and work perfectly, the powerful performance of *Antonio de la Torre* was more than convincing, it perfectly knows what it tries to tell and what it has to tell, it's not the greatest movie ever but it's damn good. 


*Rodrigo Sorogoyen* made also **Que Dios Nos Perdone**, which I haven't seen yet but seems to be as good as **El Reino**. 

I've heard good thing about the animated **Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles**. 

**Everybody Knows** is quite nice and has a great lead. 

(And you can check the Goya maybe)"
1414,Mirage. If you're into sci-fi dramas like looper or predestination.
1415,It's from 2012 but I really liked Mientras Duermes.  Also Relatos Salvajes (2015) was an interesting and funny black comedy.
1416,"I usually struggle to get into Spanish comedies but I liked Kiki El Amor Se Hace which is a sex comedy but the humour isn't raunchy in the way that US comedies are. It's about 5-6 people who are turned on by paraphilias but not the illegal kinds. 

+1 for Perfectos Desconocidos. 

I also just asked my colleagues and they said to check out movies by Aménabar"
1417,Pain and glory 2019 staring Antonio banderas. Was nominated for best foreign film this year. It's pretty good.
1418,"I loved his las brujas de zugarrumundi, it's one of my favorites horror comedies of the last years"
1419,"Excellent film, but Mexican."
1420,"yup, Banderas is fantastic in this. and Almodovar’s use of color is beautiful"
1421,"With such a varied filmography with this to the The Good, The Bad, The Weird (wacky Western), I Saw The Devil (grim serial killer revenge thriller), to The Age of Shadows (espionage thriller), Kim Jee Woon has certainly emerged as one of the most interesting action film directors in Asia. It's a shame that his sole Hollywood effort (The Last Stand) turned out to be so rote, though not by his choice I presume."
1422,"I love how different his filmography is, he basically tried every genre apart from sci fi (horror, noir, black comedy, western, thriller, action, drama) and always succeded to me. His The Last Stand is by far his worst movie but it was really fun to me and not that bad."
1423,I'm still mad about what he did to Jin Roh. Still a big fan of his other films though.
1424,Didnt he do the good the bad and the weird?
1425,Yes he did :) it's one of my favorite westerns of that decade
1426,"Yeah great film, I watch a bittersweet life straight after the vengeance trilogy, boy was I on a roll"
1427,"Bittersweet Life it's still one of my favourite movies of all time, love that movie so much. Also his A Tale of Two Sisters is one my favorites horrors, along with The Innocents and The Exorcist. One of the few movies that properly scares the fuck out of me when I watched it lol"
1428,no plot details yet but it'll be set in Iran.
1429,"One of my favourite directors. *A Separation* , *The Salesman* ,  *About Elly* and *The Past* are all must sees."
1430,"""A Separation"" should have been the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture award for 2011. It's brilliantly-written and the acting was superb."
1431,"TBF with Kiarostami having passed and Panahi being dogged by the Iranian government, Farhadi has zero competition in getting his films into the Oscars. I do think that Cannes made a mistake by giving Loach a second Palme instead of awarding a film like The Salesman top prize."
1432,Let's hope this one is in American language.
1433,Farhadi films almost always have intense climaxes but The Salesman’s is insane.
1434,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and definitely the best I've seen from after the turn of the century. I haven't seen it again for maybe two years but I still think about it every now and then. Its empathy is stupefying."
1435,"The jury made a mistake with not awarding Toni Erdmann, Elle, or Paterson the top prize at Cannes"
1436,Kiarostami's movies were never Oscar material. so there wasn't any competition to begin with.
1437,Right? He's amazing at heightening social drama to near thriller like proportions.
1438,"I would have been happy with Aquarius, The Salesman, or The Handmaiden. I would venture to say that most people think I, Daniel Blake was a head scratcher."
1439,Yeah that and Dolan's movie getting second place were pretty bad choices.
1440,defitnly not give the prize to The handmaiden was a theft. And it wasn't even nominated.
1441,"Considering the ""twist"" in the first movie, are they just going in a different direction?"
1442,2 Brahms 2 Calm
1443,The 2nd Boy
1444,"I won the first movie on blu-ray from a mod contest here on /r/movies. That said, any person that allows their kid to dig up a creepy doll and keep it around is not a fit parent and deserves whatever supernatural fate is heading their way."
1445,They are hiding inside the doll now

1447,"He was in Star is Born, wasn’t that a dramatic role?"
1448,You really bowled us over with that pitch
1449,Reminds me of St. Vincent starring Bill Murray.
1450,Never saw it. Got it confused with silver linings playbook. Aint talking about shit like that. Real griddy stuff.
1451,I lose sleep at night thinking about dialogue.
1452,That's what I was thinking!
1453,All you’re talking is shit. And it’s “gritty”.
1454,Who the fuck you wanna be? You wanna be you? Or you wanna be me? Look what I have going on. Sure I'm paying bills. but I'm surving.
1455,It's the exact same premise. Not discrediting OPs dreams though I love Chappelle and agree that he would kill a dramatic role.  Get Dave in the next Safdie bros. movie.
1456,"im not talking shit, and thanks for the correction. gritty and griddy sound alike. Sorry you think im talking shit, I dont mean to."
1457,You better get your ass out there William!
1458,Definitely checking this out!
1459,Hell yeah!
1460,"Thanks a lot, will check it out tonight."
1461,Sounds like earth vs spider 2001 sci-fi horror.
1462,Earth vs the spider
1463,"Yes, that's it! Thanks a lot! You guys are good. lol"
1464,Yup! Thanks!
1465,My take is that she has manic schizophrenia and the films narrative tries to accurately portray it
1466,"Well, those aliens can move them throught time. Why would they? I don't know."
1467,"The movie wants you to go back and forth wondering if the main character is dealing with mental illness, or real and bizarre events happening, or going crazy because of said events. 

I guess ultimately they want you to believe it was real, because another character saw the horse in the beginning, when it could have just as easily been the main character who looked up, in which case by the end the uncertainty would have remained."
1468,"""Money Heist""

I know it's a tv show and I've actually heard good things about it but the title is just so terrible I can't bring myself to click it on Netflix."
1469,I remember when I was a kid I used to think xXx was a porno since that's all that came up when googling it.
1470,"Midnight Meat Train destroyed itself with its title. 

It's based on a Clive Barker short story of the same name, and the film is genuinely fun, gruesome, and horrific. However, Barker wouldn't allow them to change the title, and audiences understandably stayed far away from it upon its release. I'll never forget seeing the trailer for the first time in the theater... the place went quiet, people were absorbed, a few folks even screamed -- then the title card hit and everybody just lost it laughing."
1471,Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. Dear god that’s a dull movie title.
1472,"John Carter.

It's way too normal sounding a name for a film that is a crazy sci fi fantasy adventure. No kid will hear the name John Carter and want to see the film. 

Even the book it was based on was called ""A Princess of Mars"". Why they felt the need to change the name into something more basic and boring sounding, i have no clue."
1473,Took me a while to get around to watching Good Will Hunting cause the title sounded like wordsalad.
1474,"Fant4stic. It’s just such stupid design choice. I get it a 4 kind looks like an upper case A. But still, I saw that and immediately knew the film would be shit.

(I know it’s still just Fantastic 4, but the design choice is just so atrocious that this movie will always be Fant4stic to me)"
1475,"As a kid I repeatedly had *The Princess Bride* recommended to me, but scoffed because I was an 8 year old boy and the only word in that title that didn't sound awful was ""The"".

Needless to say it's one of my favorite movies ever."
1476,Dredd was marketed as Dredd 3D and the trailers made it look like cheap trash. I only checked it out because I saw it was getting good reviews. Glad I did!
1477,"One rather famous example; one of the reasons ""The Shawshank Redemption"" didn't do well upon first release was because of that unwieldy title. And said title was already condensed from the novella, which was originally ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption."""
1478,"The change from the cool and original ""Pacific Rim: Maelstrom"" to the horrible and unoriginal ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" ruined my faith in that movie.  And it ended up being bad so maybe it deserved that title."
1479,The Constant Gardener
1480,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World has a way too long title, been in my watchlist for seven years."
1481,"Rise of Skywalker, I didnt like the idea of the use of someone's name in the title. Empire Strikes Back, Phantom Menace, Revenge of the Sith, cool title names. Rise of Skywalker? Its like episode 1: Origin of Vader. Episode 3: Kenobi high grounds or episode 5: Luke's family reunion"
1482,"The Princess Bride probably, to me at least. I need to see it soon though"
1483,"I found Reservoir Dogs to be an odd title, but I enjoyed the movie."
1484,"The Sun is Also a Star (2019)- Whenever I saw the trailer, which is a a lot because it seemed to be in front of EVERY movie I saw for a year, I found the title to be needlessly wordy and pretentious for appeared to be just another romance movie."
1485,"Rise of the Gaurdians picked literally the most generic title it could’ve. Disappointing, since the movie itself is decent now that I’ve watched it."
1486,"Probably Baby Driver, for a long time I thought it was some movie for kids."
1487,"Sex Lives Of The Potato Men

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368259/

Mackenzie Crook was famous from The Office (UK) at the time, and Johnny Vegas is funny, but... Nah."
1488,"Mystic Pizza, dafuq?"
1489,Motherless Brooklyn. What the fuck does that even mean? I know that's the name o the book but it's not unusual for the film to change the title.
1490,Still haven't seen Snakes on a Plane.
1491,"American beauty, but I was so, so wrong.


Opposite scenario; Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, knowing Jim Carey was in it, had it been called something else there’s no way I’m watching that movie, but it was freaking amazing."
1492,"Yes, a recent example, Birds of Prey: having the word ""fantabulous"" in the title is screaming at me ""THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU"". That is not necessarily a bad thing, movies can have different target audiences and it's likely I wouldn't have seen that one even with a different title, as soon as I saw in the poster that Cassandra Cain looked like a character from a Disney Channel sitcom. What beats me is why they decided to make it R-rated while they target tween girls."
1493,"""Don't Fuck With Cats"" on Netflix is the most recent example."
1494,"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). Sadly, Heath Ledger's final movie, and I will never see it because of the achingly pretentious title. It wouldn't be so bad if The Simpsons hadn't spoofed movies like this with fictional washed-up actor Troy McClure's doomed vanity project [The Contabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/The_Contrabulous_Fabtraption_of_Professor_Horatio_Hufnagel) Eerily, the Simpsons episode preceded ""Imaginarium"" by over a decade: I think they were primarily spoofing The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. There is something about these twee little movies that attracts actors that should know better like moths to a candle.

Ten years later I watched Zero Theorem, and despite the cooler title, I think it was another Contabulous Fabtraption in disguise."
1495,*The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel* seemed like it would be too much for me but it was actually really good
1496,"boring title movies put me off, I think. Like *The Hunt*, *Loving*, *In This Corner of The World*, or *Official Secrets*."

1498,"mother!

Fuck your lower case M and fuck your exclamation mark."
1499,"Mechanic: Resurrection (2015) made it seem like it was a reboot or a long awaited sequel to some movie in the 80's or 90's called Mechanic, but no, it was a sort-of sequel to The Mechanic which came out in 2011. Think about it: The producers of this movie sold it as if it were a reboot of some old franchise, because apparently that's what people like now right? reboots and sequels of old stuff?"
1500,"There's a Rami Malek movie on Netflix called ""Buster's Mal Heart."" It's not a bad movie at all but that title is such a word salad. Also I'm pretty sure it's not even grammatically correct, unless there's some clever double meaning that's going over my head. Even if that's the case, I still just don't like it as a title."
1501,Honey I Blew Up The Kid (1992) I wasn't interested at all to see it.
1502,Thoroughbreds. My girlfriend wanted to see it and I thought it was gonna be about these pair of friends who like horses. But I saw the RT score and thought might as well see it. Ended up being my favorite movie that year.
1503,Collateral Beauty is the dumbest fucking title to a movie I've ever heard.  I will never see that pretentious piece of shit no matter how strong the recommendation.
1504,"*The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford*. Should have just been called *The Assassination of Jesse James*. Great movie, but I ignored it for years and still think the title was a terrible mistake. It easily could have brought in a larger audience simply by not making the title sound like a history essay."
1505,"Edge of Tomorrow. Seemed so boring because of it. Turns out the original name was All You Need is Kill.

Also, Jonh Carter of Mars. Sounded like... a police movie or something"
1506,The Man who killed Hitler and then Bigfoot
1507,"I still don’t understand why it was Dr. Sleep and not ‘The Shining 2: Dr. Sleep’

Oh and let’s never forget ‘Precious: based on the novel ‘push’ by sapphire” ..... like what?!"

1509,"The Long Kiss Goodnight.  

Back when Netflix was mainly a DVD-by-mail service, my Dad and I received The Long Kiss Goodnight.  It must have sat on the counter for 2 months because we both thought it was some kind of Rom-Com and weren't really interested.  Finally, Dad's gf convinced us to give it a shot one night.  It's become a family favorite, and we can quote almost the whole thing now.    We almost never watched on of our favorite movies because of the title."
1510,"Recently, The Rhythm Section. The trailer seemed ok, but that title did absolutely nothing for me. When the bad reviews came out, that was enough for me to skip it. I'm not exactly sure what would have worked, and I have no idea of the relevance of the actual title, but something else could have got me to the theatre."
1511,"Mars Needs Moms. The title wasnt changed for the UK release, no one here is going to see a film with a 'moms' in the title."
1512,"RoboCop is and was a ridiculous title.  I had no interest in seeing it until I saw a late-night TV spot that represented the movie better and I ended up going to see it with a friend.  It was so good, we just stayed in the theater to see what would happen and nothing did, so we watched it again."
1513,"Even though I enjoy Little Nicky, the title kinda sucks. It doesnt really tell you alot like Waterboy (occupation/sports) Billy Madison ( a child like name) or Happy Gilmore (sounds sporty and similar to Billy Madison). I feel like calling it ""Hell of a good time"" or ""Hell of a city"" would be a better title. Hell even ""He's the devil"" would be better and funny."

>""or changed your view on the film before you even saw it?""

I think that Parasite (2019) is a bad title for that particulr film - a great film by the way - but if you know nothing about the film that title feels gross and does not covey that you're facing a black comedy. If it is crucial to reflect parasite theme in the title, they could have used multi-word title that clarifies that it's metaphorical, like Dreams of Parasites or whatever. (Just an example of a multi-word title, obviously DoP is a lame title.)

Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) implies some Apocalyptic scale but not much happens and the whole thing is over in two or three days.

Antichrist (2009) isn't a bad title but I didn't want to see an Antichrist story by Lars von Trier. Funny thing is - I've learned that there is no Antichrist there, but still can't get past the title."

1516,"In 1977, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope 


Like, what the fuck? This is the only film they’ve made so far and it’s number 4? Did they not film the first 3 to save costs or something? Or maybe it’s a mistake. I bet they’re going to do 1-3 later and claim it was on purpose.




*Edit: yes, I know in reality it was just “Star Wars” at release.*"
1517,"""The Mummy"" (2017 Film)

It's not terrible, just confusing. I kept seeing the trailers for it and wondering if it was a reboot of the Brendan Fraser films. Little did I know that it is more than just a ""Mummy"" movie, but also ties in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Should've called it something like ""Dr. Jekyll and the Curse of the Mummy,"" which sounds more like a classic adventure/monster movie."
1518,"An example of terrible translation, because the original title is La Casa Del Papel - which translates directly to English to ""The Paper House"" or ""House [made] of Paper"". 

And the show is about robbing a mint / money printing facility. So it's a rather clever play on words - the direct meaning, plus referring to the plan being risky.

Pretty average show though."
1519,Goodness it sounds like it stars Tara Reid and Nicolas Cage
1520,"I feel the same. It's just such a blatant title. Especially given the numerous heist films I've seen. Feels like I've seen the whole thing before even watching it, just based off the title."
1521,"House of Paper would be accurate. Or House of Money at least as it's translated like that in my country

I suspect it might have something to do with House of Cards so they changed it.

It's a pretty nice series with wacky and unrealistic scenarios it's entertaining"
1522,imagine back in the day trying to look for that movie on Kazaa or Limewire
1523,I can forgive people for thinking it might be the title of a porn flick.
1524,How did people stay away from it if it was ONLY released in DOLLAR theaters? The distribution company never released it wider than dollar theaters. Of COURSE people would stay away from a film they couldn't see
1525,Midnight meat train is a fantastic title when it's combined with the poster. You got a somber Vinnie Jones looking out of a Subway divider holding a bloody tenderizer.
1526,The book was pretty shite too; I don't actually want to watch the movie after reading the book.
1527,"The movie was re-titled John Cater of Mars early on in development since the movie borrowed heavily from other books in the series (not just ""A Princess of Mars"") and was obviously meant to be the start of a franchise. 

Then the true dumb title change came where they dropped the of Mars part and just called the movie ""John Carter.""

The reason behind this change was that ""Mars Needs Moms"" had just bombed horribly for Disney and they didn't want the word Mars in the title of any movie since the last Mars movie had done so badly."
1528,">""It's way too normal sounding a name for a film that is a crazy sci fi fantasy adventure. No kid will hear the name John Carter and want to see the film.

>Even the book it was based on was called ""A Princess of Mars"". Why they felt the need to change the name into something more basic and boring sounding, i have no clue.""

""A Princess of Mars"" would be a misleading name for a franchise too. But the book series is called 'John Carter of Mars'. That 'of Mars' makes it so much better and it was already there, no need to come up with anything."
1529,"Tragically, they changed the title at the last minute from John Carter of Mars, which has a wonderfully pulp/boy's own adventure feel to it. John Carter is just a ridiculously bland title for an expansive sci fi."
1530,"For me it was the opposite, I thought the title meant hunting for some good will, so I thought it would be a feel good movie, then when I learned that Matt Damon's character's name was Will Hunting I was like ""what?"""

Sure, it's not the worst thing they did to undermine the themes and feel of the franchise that they were trying to continue, but it was still a bad sign, and signalled that they were more interested in cashing in on an existing brand than in telling a story of their own.

\* Well technically ""Force"" isn't a made-up word, but it would make absolutely no sense in that title except with its Star Wars definition."
1554,"Ohhh my god I liked the movie but the title is truly awful. I thought they would justify it by making the new name for the Force users rising out of the ashes of the Jedi but no.

1555,It sounds like it has *kissing* in it.

John Carter also went through a few changes iirc.  Heh...

Honestly I never noticed until someone pointed it out to me. [It's not on the DVD box art or the theatrical poster.] (https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/seven)

> Sharknado (2013)

It's supposed to be intentionally bad. It's a parody.

> xXx (2002)

The three X's refer to his three strikes, which leads to life in prison or death. It's supposed to reinforce the fact that Cage is a criminal, which is what puts the film into motion.

Other than that not bad."

That's how I interpreted it but it made no sense grammatically. I legit spent a decent amount of time mulling the title over in my head trying to figure out what it was supposed to mean. Funnily enough I never actually looked up the film online to put it to rest until I decided to watch it for the first time. Which is funny cause the Letterboxd description of the film literally starts with ""Will Hunting has a genius-level IQ..."""
1597,"Yep, it doesn't help that when most people say the name out loud, they tend to say the Good and Will together (like the store name) so it sounds like Goodwill Hunting as opposed to Good ""WillHunting""."

-*The Last Jedi*: ends on a scene of a force-using slave child implying the Jedi can indeed live on besides Rey.
 
-*Rise of Skywalker*: Rey is a Palpatine and the Skywalker family line is ended"

1616,"You're 100% right, and that's one of the reason marketing failed so miserably. The film is basically KINGSMAN in tone, but they hid that from the majority of their trailers - and I don't know a single person who was able to tell what the film was about based on its strange posters.

Even its title (good mention in this thread) was confusing. Nobody knew if it was a Birds of Prey movie or a Harley Quinn movie, and judging by the fact that the Birds of Prey have very little to do with it until the ending, they'd have probably made more money if they just called it Harley Quinn and let it lead into other things."
1617,"I'm not saying that there isn't an adult target audience for campy, but not all of it is going to go for an R-rated superhero movie. Surely you have to attract a larger, younger audience too. This is not like a TV show, where you can succeed with a niche audience, this is a movie intended for blockbuster status. The budget may not be particularly high by superhero movies standards, but it's still very high. It can't afford to be niche."
1618,"""Two copies?"""
1619,"It's also the best part about the movie, no need to watch it."
1620,"Yea, but Hitler didn't try to eat his face"
1621,">""Parasite is actually a really fitting title given the premise. The family embed themselves into the upper class and begin leaching off of them for gain.""

Even more so, Bong Joon-Ho said that the rich family members are parasites too because they are leaching labour. It is fitting but definitely misleading, especially for a Bong Joon-Ho's film since he did sci-fi before."
1622,">""That sounds horrible lol.""

It really is! It's just an example of multi-word title with a word 'parasite' in it. Good title takes time, and I don't care to brainstorm great milti-word title for hours - it will never be used anyway, that's a waste of time."
1623,"I did saw that one after all. Yep, it can't be described without the word 'bonkers'. Not sure about underrated part though, but I may rewatch it someday.

You should see Interstate 60 (2002)."
1624,">""I never read this as a single title, like ""trek into darkness."" I read it as Start Trek: Into Darkness, which sounds a lot better.""

Yep, it would have been just fine with a colon. But it aint't there. For example, no collon on either IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes or Wikipedia.

>""I don't get the hate for this one. People seem to just hate the idea of a PG-13 Die Hard and seem to dislike everything about it from there.""

That may be my favourite part of the franchise (now I'll be downvoted into oblivion). But that doesn't make its title any better.

>""It's supposed to be intentionally bad. It's a parody.""

That's why it's listed in a section 'bad but very appropriate, you know that it is either exactly for you or you should never see it'.

>""The three X's refer to his three strikes, which leads to life in prison or death. It's supposed to reinforce the fact that Cage is a criminal, which is what puts the film into motion.""

Yeah, and the middle X refers to the Xander's name. It's ~~really deep~~ fits the film, cheesy title for a cheesy action film. Still, it is cheesy."

JCoM is an alternative title, thouhg I believe that Burroughs called it only Barsoom."
1629,"This is certainly more accurate, since John Carter is only the main character in some of them.  His son, Carthoris, takes over as main character for a while, and some are about another Earthling named Ulysses Paxton, and A Fighting Man of Mars is about an ordinary Martian soldier."

1633,"I understand the point,  I just don't like it. I enjoyed the movie. I loved Rey burying Leia and Luke's lightsabers. It was symbolic that the Skywalker legacy is literally being layed to rest. I just hate her taking on fhe Skywalker name. Rey is neither true jedi or sith. She is Rey and I personally think if she responded with ""Just Rey.""  It would have been more impactful, because she discovered who she truly is and being ""Rey"" is enough. Just my personal opinion."

1635,😂
1636,"A flight attendant traps a snake in a microwave, then hits the microwave's built in ""snake"" button to kill it. It's a fun B-movie that got way over-hyped before its release."

1638,"i'm glad you also think the movie is amazing. the Kevin Spacey drama has, for some reason, made a lot of people suddenly decide it sucks."
1639,Oh. Can you elaborate on that? What about that title was off putting?
1640,"I mean... after watching the film. I have no idea why they would try to target a younger audience. I really don’t think they did. Sure they used “fantabulous” in the name. It’s just a word. The trailer alone has Harley snorting coke out of the air to get hyped up to kill some people. It’s definitely not a tween movie and I really don’t think, outside of the colours and that one word was it really marketed toward tweens.

Maybe that’s part of the failings of the film. People see the marketing and think it’s going to be some tween aimed Hot Topic movie. But then it has an R rating so teens aren’t going to see it because they can’t."
1641,"I think that's exactly the brilliance of Parasite's marketing. The name and poster both seem like there will be some sort of sci fi element to the film. And Bong's filmography definitely points that way too. But the film is pretty normal, and even coaxes you into thinking nothing out of the ordinary will happen until towards the end of the second act. I went into it completely expecting something out of the ordinary and I know a lot of other people online felt the same. It's one of the things that gives Parasite its shock factor."
1642,Ha fair I understand. Although in my opinion I quite like the name 'Parasite' as its pretty much the main theme of the film.
1643,"Thanks, I'll check it out."
1644,"Tbf Star Wars has confusing titles though. I’ve been trying to introduce new people to the franchise and literally everyone is like ‘why is it called Attack of the Clones when that is literally the last 5min of the movie?’ and I cannot answer that question other than ‘Because begun, the Clone Wars have.’"
1645,Oh...well I guess there’s got to be an audience for it somewhere?
1646,"Alright Just Rey, 'yer a wizard!"
1647,It’s a book?
1648,"To flowery and provincial, it smacked of cheesy Anericana"
1649,"You're entitled to your opinion, but if they tried to fool sci-fi fans intetionally I would describe that as nefarious and disrespectful hustle, not brilliance, because marketing is a form of a promice and a deal. I enjoy many genres, but I choose when I want to see a light-hearted comedy, an exausing Holocaust drama or sci-fi, they are not interchangeable.

Though I do not think that they tried to do so, Bong Joon-Ho even said that distributors were against that title for that very reason."
1650,Bad move admitting Attack of the Clones exists if you’re trying to get new people into SW.
1651,Lmfao yes!!!
1652,It was written by the director after the movie. It's been awhile since I read it but I remember I really loved it.
1653,Fair point.
1654,"I just think the film is really special. And that not exactly knowing what you’re going to get is part of why it’s so great. The trailer and poster are sci fi esque- nothing about them really say anything though. It’s really quite ambiguous and I think most of the sci fi connotations are put on by us rather than the marketing itself. I think calling anything about it’s marketing nefarious or a disrespectful hustle is a leap. The film is Korean, if they were trying to make money it wouldn’t be."
1655,">""I just think the film is really special.""

It is special but because of the contents, not because it has a divine title that fits the theme of the movie. It could have been called The Rock, The House, Families, Stairs, Korean Gambit, etc and it still would have been an amazing film, and it still would have been a film about leaching, and marketing still would have been ambiguous ('not exactly knowing what you’re going to get'). I'm not critising the movie, I'm critisizing an arguably misleading title.

>""are put on by us rather than the marketing itself""

I agree. But it was obvious that many will have that very impession, and they did not made an effort to prevent it. Inaction is also a choice."
1656,That’s fair. Inaction is definitely still a choice. All that being said I quite enjoyed not exactly knowing what the film would be like. And the ambiguous marketing really helped that for me.
1657,">""All that being said I quite enjoyed not exactly knowing what the film would be like. And the ambiguous marketing really helped that for me.""

Good for you! I also saw it without knowing what it is about, or even that it is a black comedy. I love that kind of experience but that doesn't happen that much nowadays since there are too many bad films and one should be carefull."
1658,Have you checked the trailer for Flu on youtube to see if it matches your memory? Because it really does sound like that ... or maybe you're remembering parts from 2 movies?
1659,"Have you tried looking at the inflight entertainment program for the airline? 

Here is ANA's for Feb 2019  [https://www.ana.co.jp/skychannel/en/feb19/top.html](https://www.ana.co.jp/skychannel/en/feb19/top.html)"
1660,I need to know.
1661,"The movie is the flu. I remember those exact scenes in the beginning, where >!the outbreak starts on shipping containers caused by sick refugees being trafficked. The shipping container is opened by two smugglers and patient zero escapes and evades capture throughout the movie while everyone and the whole city's infrastructure goes into a panic. As everything and everyone around them starts to crumble, the story follows a doctor and her daughter, as they go through the city and try to escape the outbreak. The ending was a schtick in my opinion, but it involved the daughter dying and screaming and telling soldiers not to shoot her mom, as a mob tried to overrun soldiers fending off a quaratine line.!<


I'm fairly certain the movie you are looking for is ""The Flu"" because of how you described patient zero and the shipping containers. This scene itself is distinctive enough to identify the movie.

I watched the movie a few years back while it was on Netflix because I had to satiate my hunger for a good foreign thriller like Train to Busan."
1662,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deranged_(2012_film)


I guess you are searching for this"
1663,"A Korean Zombie hit from recent years
I think of Train to Busan. 
if it’s not your movie, check it out anyway. I think you will love it"
1664,"Orlando is one of my favourite films ever, good list."
1665,"I wasn't a big fan of it either. I liked the story, score, cinematography, but Yorgos' dialogue delivery is so off-putting to me. I don't understand why he makes his characters talk like they're aliens masquerading as humans..."
1666,"Not my favorite of Yorgos Lanthimos either. Interesting for sure, but he has made better fims. The Lobster and The Favourite for example."
1667,"I think some of the reason you don't like it are reasons I really appreciate it (it's probably my favourite from *Lanthimos*). I love the coldness of the human relationship, I love the almost absurd/surrealist atmosphere which is balanced by the very and cold tone of the movie. 

[The spaghetti scene](https://youtu.be/dzRw5m18kdw) Is a perfect example of what I love in this movie, on one side the surreal exchange proposed by the boy, and on the other side the tragic situation of the wife. I also love the reversed power balance which make the scene feel a little bit like a very serious scene in a mafia movie in which the big bad is made very menacing while telling a little story and doing some random and normal stuff (which is natural in this situation, because the ""big bad"" isn't a mafia boss). 

>	Yet he invites him over to his house, let’s him be alone with his kids and then let’s him take his daughter out on a walk alone.

I don't see this as a problem. It's in line with the rest of the movie, *Collin Ferrel* sees himself as a sort of subtitution father for the boy. 

>	parents can just sense that sort of thing

Well, the parents are abnormal enough for this to be perfectly normal in this movie. 

>	Next, they never explain what the hell this high school kid did that not even top doctors from all over the world could solve.

And it doesn't matter, it's some fantastic in a non-fantastic movie you should accept as what it is. An idea that is there to developed a story and not think about the plausibility of the idea. It's the same thing as the hypnosis and special operation in **Get Out**, it's the same as the clone world in **Us**, the submissiveness drug in **Creepy**, etc... (i fail to find other examples right now, but there are a lot more) On the opposite, I'm sure it would have been a great waste if it had been explained."
1668,"I liked the story, but I did find the and robot-like acting/personalities to be weird.  I do think that this is to create more tension, and it definitely had a weird effect on me; it even resonated with me well after the film ended.  

I know this won't be a popular opinion, but I couldn't even finish David Lynch's Blue Velvet due to the weird acting.  It just comes off as disingenuous and found it distracting and annoying.  Even some of the scenes weren't believable like the closet scene near the beginning.  Maybe I'll give it another shot another time."
1669,"The movie is a modern interpretation of the Euripides tragedy Iphigenia in Aulis where Agamemnon decides to sacrifice his daughter to ensure victory over Troy.

Most of the answers to your questions, though, are answered by the knowledge that everyone had been drinking prior to surgery when the boy's dad died on the table and Colin Farrell's character feels incredible guilt over it."
1670,"It's honestly my least favorite of his films, possibly because I just couldn't buy into anything that was happening in such a real-world setting.

Part of the reason his other pictures work so well is because the locations, worlds, and time periods understandably blend with his style. Sacred Deer just begged so many questions, felt too alien, and had trouble interweaving his quirk with the bleakness of the story."
1671,"“Well the parents are abnormal enough for this to be perfectly normal in the movie” 
Ok but why are they so strange. I get why the creepy kid is, but a Doctor? Who has to talk to and meet new people on a daily basis? I don’t think so. The movie expects to much suspension of disbelief which is funny you bring up Us because I also didn’t like that movie for the same reasons. In Get Out they at least tell us it’s hypnosis, in this movie there is literally nothing known of what the kid did. Lastly I think you have to agree with my last point about Collin Ferrels character killing his kid instead of his wife, you know that was dumb."
1672,"He is actually a heart surgeon, though, not a normal family doctor.  many surgeons lack the bedside manner of a family doctor.  Although that issue is kind of immaterial as in a movie where magic seemingly exists, should we necessarily be questioning the realness of other aspects of the film?"
1673,"Still your opinion. If you copy paste the reviewers' words, that's different story."
1674,"as long as you aren’t blindly going with what reviewers say, you’re good. it’s okay to change your mind about a movie when you hear someone else’s perspective"
1675,Sale people do it all day... every day.
1676,"On the DVD there's an option for subtitles to pop up during the ""Bar Story"" flashback where the narrator is speaking in Cockney Rhyming Slang. Its HILARIOUS. Also the Snatch DVD has ""Pikey Subtitles"" which is almost as good.

""don't plain and simple with me Bazza... Its for Spanking"" I love the villain in this movie almost as much as I Love Bricktop"

Guy Ritchie is a great visual director!"
1679,"Oh and eh, lads, it’s been emotional."
1680,My favorite part of this movie is the surprisingly good performance that Sting puts in. I wish he appeared in more movies.
1681,That one's on my watchlist now as I just watched Snatch the other day & it was really great!
1682,"I love Lock Stock. I think its Ritchie's best movie (Better than Snatch, although I do also like Snatch).

Fackin Northun Monkies

Fucking southern fairies"
1683,*Probably* my favorite Guy Ritchie movie. I've seen the movie countless times and that ending always cracks me up.
1684,It gets better every rewatch.
1685,Jesus I’m old
1686,"The Gentlemen was so-so... too much talking, not enough Matthew McConaughey."
1687,"I watched it, didn't like it. Maybe its like snatch, didn't like it the first time i watched it but liked it more each subsequent time and now ive seen it like 30 times and fucking LOVE the movie."
1688,"I love both this and Snatch but I gravitate more toward Lock, Stock.  

A combination of the movies color scheme, lack of known actors, and the low budget feel just makes it feel more gritty and down to earth to me. 

Snatch has like that Hollywood sheen on it that adds some glamor to the movie."
1689,"My uncle put me on To that movie a decade ago, classic."
1690,">On the DVD there's an option for subtitles to pop up during the ""Bar Story"" flashback where the narrator is speaking in Cockney Rhyming Slang

Interesting. I've only ever seen this version, even on TV. And I'm in the UK."
1691,Ya like dags?
1692,I haven’t seen his Snatch yet but definitely will at some point this year. I’ve heard that’s one of his best films. I’m also interested in watching Revolver and RockNRolla at some point too
1693,"""I WILL kill him!"""
1694,The old dvd I used to have didn't have it as an option. It was just always there.
1695,it's fer me ma
1696,I fucking hate pikeys!
1697,Oh...dogs. Yeah I like dags.
1698,"In my humble opinion, Snatch is top of the food chain as far as Guy Ritchie films go. Lock Stock is top notch, but I think Snatch will blow you away. So many great scenes, great characters, and outstanding style. Plus you get Bricktop in Snatch and that guy is one bad motherfucker."
1699,I can’t help that I laughed because “I haven’t seen his snatch yet”
1700,Snatch might be one of the best movies of all time in my opinion.
1701,"Snatch and Lockstock are the only two Giy Richie films anyone ever needs to see. Both great, the rest are somewhere between poor and utter dog shit."
1702,/u/hitchlikersguide is correct. Snatch and Lock Stock are the only good movies he ever made. The rest were trash. Snatch is by far his best film.
1703,Skip Revolver or leave it for last. His weakest film next to Swept Away.
1704,Same. I just thought that was part of the movie.
1705,Periwinkle blue
1706,Your what?
1707,"I don't care if hes Mohammed ""i'm hard"" Bruce Lee, you can't change fighters!"
1708,"To me it's the other way around. Snatch was great, but I prefer the more downplayed humour and sluggish pace in Lock Stock. Snatch always seemed to me like it was Lock Stock 2.0, massaged to appeal more to a US audience. That's not a bad thing at all. I just preferred the style of the first one."
1709,It’s a fucking anti-aircraft gun Vincent.
1710,Stop me again when I'm walking!

1716,I'm glad I wasn't the only one who found that funny hahaha
1717,I cant pick a beat scene in snatch.
1718,The Man from U.N.C.L.E. was good too. Not the same style of film but very watchable.
1719,"RockNRolla was good, man, don't know what you're talkin about"
1720,ouch! it's not that bad.
1721,cause he dodges bullets avi
1722,You can take bets at the fight!
1723,I agree -- l think all the parts came together in a better and more intricate way in Lock Stock. Something about how the violent pikeys fixed everything in the end of Snatch rubbed me the wrong way. A borderline deus ex machina.

1733,"Here's another badass line:  ""Shoot him again, his soul is still dancing!"""
1734,"It's badass. Then again, it's easy to be badass when you only have to intimidate little Jojo. I thought Elsa was more badass when the Gestapo guys came and she coolly pretended to be someone else.

But anyway, in that scene I suppose that Elsa was saying it more for herself than for Jojo, as a way to remind herself that even if they were persecuted and treated like dirt, there was nothing to be ashamed of in being Jewish.

Regarding the opinion some have expressed in this thread, saying that it's a supremacist statement, I think it's all a matter of context. there's nothing wrong in feeling proud of what you are and where you come from, as long as it doesn't make you think you're better than anybody else. I don't think in that scene Else meant that Jewishness was something to be proud of, not that everyone else was inferior to them."
1735,"*""Yes, that's where we live, in your stupid head.""*

My fav film of last year <3"
1736,"Elsa: Say it. Say it. Say what I am. 

Jojo: A Jew.

Elsa: *Gesundheit*

I really loved this line."
1737,">JoJo:  What did they do?

>Rosie:  They did what they could.

I thought that was the best line.  And great foreshadowing."
1738,"This was such a simple line but I loved when Hitler goes to Jojo ""Can I give you some really good advice?""."
1739,"Me and my girlfriend saw this just recently, towards the end of its run. We both loved it way more than we expected to. I appreciated that it didn't compromise in showing how it feels to be someone that's living under heavy propaganda or who's been brainwashed. The movie never says ""This person is a bad person"" but instead it shows that they're simply living in a manufactured reality, that they need help.

A very unexpected part was how the actual violence was very grounded, with very few exceptions. You directly connect that ""Oh, it's not just JoJo, this is the fallout of when this happens en masse."" Fantastic movie that nails its intended message, which is very serious, while still being the best comedy I've seen in quite awhile."
1740,I liked the one about how dancing is for people who don't have jobs.
1741,That line delivery was stellar. One of my favorite parts of the film.
1742,"Dude the screenplay was so good too, I just finished reading it and it deserved the Oscar."
1743,"I’d love to see more stories revolving around jewish pride. I remember that as a kid I’d get tired of having an eternal mental image of jewish people as victims to pity for the holocaust and little to nothing else (Which obviously they were, and was horrible). So when Inglourious Basterds came out and proudly portrayed a jewish platoon running around occupied france it was a real kick. Just destroying the fascists left and right."

1745,"Seems like reverse racism to me /s

1752,What does it mean? I don't know much about Jew and Aryan culture.
1753,was Hitler fat? i always see him as slender in any photos/videos

Matthew 27:39-41

Yeah, it be nice if they stopped using that as political propaganda of their own in the middle-east."
1760,"I still can’t believe this movie was his first time acting, and the movie was nominated and won awards, this kids gonna have a great career"
1761,This really was the best movie of 2019.
1762,Not so much. Judaism and the Talmud teaches that Jews are the master race and that gentiles  (non-Jews are) unclean and unworthy to be treated as friends or equals.
1763,/r/Im14AndThisIsDeep
1764,"I loved the movie and that quote has some epic on it. However I thought that they will tell in some way how that quote is just the same as being proud of bein arian. That there aren't races better than other and all of them are humans no matter what they believe in.

It bugs me that they let this reference like that, knowing that the whole movie message is about fighting against the extremism and critical thinking."
1765,Love jewish supremecists pretending like they are right
1766,LOOOOOOOoOOOOOOLLLL!!!! OK I have absolutely GOT to see this now.
1767,"""Chosen by God"" 

That character definitely would have grown to be a Zionist"
1768,"You could replace ""Jews"" with any group of people who think they are superior to everyone else, and you end up with the same problems we see today. 

People believe and act as if antisemitism exists in a vacuum. 

If only Reddit didn't learn history from Hollywood propaganda."
1769,Movie was just not good. Jokes fell flat. The message has been done before in better films. The characters were written very poorly. Taika is overrated.
1770,"Sounds like a bunch of psych ward babble to me, but I'm not really into myth propaganda."
1771,Oh that was great. I need to memorize this and slightly alter it for Trumpers.
1772,"> What a fucking badass thing to say to a child who mocks your race because of Nazi propaganda.

This movie technically is Jewish propaganda.

Judaism is a religion, not a race. They're considered 'ethnoreligious' even though it's mostly just religious.

As a collective group, their identity is somewhat elitist, what with that whole Chosen people stuff and their religious values can tend to be somewhat bigoted. This scene from Knocked Up for example:

https://youtu.be/ziQJsG6s8c4?t=75

Not really saying this to bash on Jewish people but holy hell, just cool it with the Nazis for a bit."
1773,sounds like the same bullshit the nazis peddled just reversed tbh
1774,That kid was unbelievable. The hugs between him and Jojo were priceless with the little leg kick.
1775,Miniature Nick Frost was indeed a highlight.
1776,"^This!
Was by far my favorite line and was looking for it here."
1777,Haha yes!!! Loved this movie.  I really liked it when he said he was going home to get a cuddle from his mom!!

1781,Taika Waititi presents: “Hitler Bad: A Wes Anderson Parody”
1782,Seriously.  I can’t wait to see what she does in the future.
1783,"I didn't realize it was the same actress. Yeah, she's got quite a career ahead of her. *Leave No Trace* was really powerful and criminally under-seen. I checked it out because it was the same director as *Winter's Bone* which I regard as one of the best American films of the 21st Century."
1784,"I watched this right after watching Jojo Rabbit and she is incredible.  Mark my words, she'll be holding an Oscar one day."
1785,I knew that as a line from the song Coffin Dance by AJJ. Wonder if it can be traced back further
1786,Hey could you give me a quick refresher on when that line was said?
1787,That’s is indeed badass!

1792,Even the Nazi captain who dreams about being back on the front line ended up being a good dude at heart
1793,It did win adapted screenplay tho
1794,Are screenplays for big movies like this easily available? Any website where I can find them?
1795,I know this thread is a bit of a Jojo jerk off but I much preferred Little Women. The quality of the writing in Jojo is really good but the substance is tone deaf & incredibly misguided IMO.
1796,"Kinda missed the point then. It was basically a role reversal in many ways, especially the first scene with the German officer and the Bear Jew. If you'd turn it around, with an Allied officer refusing to disclose the location of his fellow soldiers and getting beaten to death with a baseball bat by a Nazi it would clearly be to establish the Nazi as the antagonist. 

But now, because of a greater historic context and a reversal in uniforms, people cheer it on blindly.

The whole movie (Inglourious Basterds) is basically telling us that everyone in war is bad, that *war* is bad, that what is permissible and acceptable depends on who wins the war and only afterward do we decide who we, as outsiders, were supposed to cheer for and who we were supposed to hate.

The same with this quote in many ways. ""I am descended from those who wrestle angels and kill giants. We were chosen by God."" is being used as an excuse to do some horrid shit in Palestine. And 'we' can't comment on it, because history decided who is good and who is bad."
1797,Definitely not an uncut one though.
1798,"You can't out-awful reality, you should have learned that by now."
1799,"I mean, circumstances and context do matter a lot. It would be rather troubling if someone stated the line in question as a general view on life (and there are religious sects that use this sort of mentality to justify being insufferable cockbags to everyone else). But in the context of the film and what she was facing, yes, obviously it's about facing down someone who sees you as less than human. But this is reddit...you can't expect people to have actually watched the damn film they're opining on. /s"
1800,"If you go looking for the ugly in people, you will always succeed."
1801,"The nominated movies this year are actually all pretty decent films, not one I'd consider a stinker (although that's not to say there weren't other films also worthy of consideration). Each of them is worth your time.

Your tastes are your own, of course, but give them a look if you get a chance."
1802,"There are a couple of Biblical references in the quote. Jacob wrestled with an angle for a night. David killed Goliath. Obviously, they were Jewish, God's people. 

Hitler called the people he deemed superior Aryan. They were ""superior"" because of blonde hair, blue eyes, white skin etc. Basically, Elsa uses the Biblical history of the Jewish people to impress Jojo, to scare him. She has to keep him under the thumb or he might tell on her."
1803,"In Biblical passages, all of the religious prophets are Jews who commit supernatural feats (fight angels, defeat giants, and many more) under the blessing of God - hence, they are the ""chosen people"". Even Jesus was a Jew. 

This is a popular notion. Heck, even my religion acknowledges that they are special because of this fact.

Hitler encouraged the idea of an ""Aryan"" race during his time in Germany during World War 2, an ideal and superior race. Jojo, a German boy with blue eyes and blonde hair, boasts about this fact and also about his features as an Aryan. Before his significant character development in the film, he viewed the Jews as less than human because of the propaganda against them. 

Elsa won't take his shit and proceeds to beat him, while stating the quote above. This is an amazing example of defiance."
1804,"The line is actually, ""you were chosen by a pathetic little man who can't even grow a full mustache."""
1805,"Yes he was. And he had one testicle. His penis was only a quarter of an inch long, and it grew out of his hairy bellybutton.

What you going to do? Defend Hitler?"
1806,"Child actors, even good ones, often do not have great acting careers as adults. I have to agree, though, that the kid who interpreted Jojo did an excellent job. It was not a particularly easy role, having to sell his inner fantasy world, his childish belief in the nazi ideas he had been taught..."
1807,It’s not being said in the context of squatting on Palestinian land. It’s said in the context of World War II.
1808,"I agree with you that in a modern context I would assume any Jew who said some shit like this was a bigot and not to be trusted. This is the type of thing someone would say to you right before going on a rant about how we need to kill all the Palestinians or something.

But in the context of it being said by a girl whose family was murdered, whose people are being exterminated like animals and who the entire world seems to not give a fuck about I don't have a problem with it. When you're facing total genocide and the world has abandoned you I don't think there's a problem with believing in the strength (and maaaaybe even superiority) of your people. It's something you need to do to keep your will to live."
1809,"People misinterpret this quote and think that it's implying that the Jews are better than everyone. It's always about something political. 

No, this was a great quote because this girl who literally can die any minute still finds the strength to take pride in her identity as a Jew and draws strength from her ancestor's achievements.

1846,"Aryan was pushed before WW2 in a build up and justification for Germany to go to war again the lesser Slavic races for land for the German people, called lebensruam, which was already an older concept dating back to the early 1850s. It   wasn’t a during the war creation."
1847,"I know, but still, that whole dialogue is about whose race is best. The message is harmful in everyway if tok out of context, that in that scene is to mock the idea of the aryan race. My headcannon is that they use that to mock every supremacist set of beliefs as absurd."
1848,"I think it's similar to that one scene in Game of Thrones with Sansa and Myranda:

Sansa: ""I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home, and you can't frighten me."" After Myranda subtly tries to scare her by suggesting that Ramsey might kill her by throwing her to the dogs

She's literally gonna be offered to him on a silver plate, she hates him because he invaded her home (Winterfell), and she's bathed by someone who hates her (Myranda), and she's alone with no one who can actually help her. But she takes comfort in the fact that Winterfell belongs to the Starks, it is the home where she grew up in and where she belongs, no one can take it from her, and she won't let a mere nobody threaten her in her home.

Of course, what happens next is sad, but in that one moment, Sansa felt defiant and powerful."
1849,"Yes, I understand the context and it's ok. I find it more like a meta problem. In the sense that they opened a great way of talk about supremacism in any form, but they just went for the easy thing for making the audience cheer.

It's not bad, I understand it, and it's a cool moment, I liked it. But it bugged me for that lost opportunity. This is a movie that's not historically accurate and takes a lot of licenses to equate out modern world to this WWII depiction. For example JoJo's bedroom all filled with propaganda as if hitler was a fabricated celebrity idol nowadays, the clones (wich is a reference to a movie), the Captain and his new uniform. It won't feel awkward to talk a bit more about supremacism in genral.

However I'm ok with it, just bugs me because I felt it as a lost opportunity."
1850,"I understand the intention of the quote. But it's relying too much, IMO, in wich one is more powerful or the best. When I think that stating that some race is better than any other goes against the point they are trying to state. However is just a minor thing that bugged me in an overall movie. Not because I'm feeling offended, but because I felt it like a cheesy way to earn a cheer from the audience by staying on the surface of that question."

-

>Yes it happened, but the entire thing could have been avoided, and the blame doesn't completely fall on the Nazis.

-

>No, it could have been avoided if the British and French governments hadn't kept pressuring the Germans after WW1. All of that stuff was due to local national politics and didn't have fuck all to do with the Jews until the Zionists got involved.

He might not be a Nazi, but he sure is Nazi-adjacent."
1855,"The Nazis were a European political party that lasted between the mid 1930s and 1940s. That was over 80 years ago yet here you are calling me a Nazi because Hollywood shoehorns Nazis into everything the possibly can. 

Fuck the Nazis. Hitler was an idiot.

Your media system acts like Trump is like Hitler. How the fuck does that work considering Trump does whatever Netenyahu tells him? Israel just named a settlement after Trump yet somehow he's also the leader of white supremacist anti semites?

The US has the biggest military in the world. Because of the way the US military is embedded into Hollywood, they've put out over like 1800 movies and TV shows that are laced with propaganda.

The US has also been at war for almost 2 decades in like 6 different countries which is nothing compared to the laundry list of countries overthrown by the CIA.

The US destroyed it's journalism industry by letting big media companies engulf it and turn it into tabloid & partisan garbage industry designed to cause divisions and make people call each other stupid names like Nazis."

1863,"Gunners palace, is a PG-13 war documentary with 42 uses of the word fuck. I think it was originally rated R, but after appeal they gave it a PG-13 rating.

> Under normal circumstances more than one use of the word ""fuck"" would get a film an R-rating. In this instance, the MPAA reasoned that a person old enough to be recruited by the army should be allowed to view a documentary on actual army life. However the rating also carried the notice that it was awarded on appeal to provide a better cautionary warning to parents concerned about what their children are viewing."

1874,It’s a jerk off when everyone is just repeating the same 5 damn talking points about it.
1875,"I don't think it handled the holocaust well at all. I think if I had to whittle it down I'd say the amount of joy it has in the first half of the movie feel problematic when the second half is just way too light on the subject of war. We didn't need more jokes during the battle scene, but Taika was in his own way about it. 

This is all made worse by trying to make Sam Rockwell's character sympathetic while the soldiers liberating the town were played to be assholes and cruel. WW2 was not a ""both sides' situation.

Edit: Replied to a few of these but honestly it is not worth my time or energy to hear people defend nazi's. Acknowledging that the allies did bad things does not make WW2 a nuanced thing and is the equivalent of people trying to frame the US Civil War as about state rights and poking at the North's war crimes. Like, holy shit y'all it should not have to be explained that genocide is above pretty much anything else and the people who were on the side of it do not need defending!"
1876,"Do the same for Jewish scientists and artists, and it's pretty clear that Hitler was wrong."

How dare that little boy mock you. Of course, after months and months of living as an animal, Elsa lashed out and she shot down his notion of superiority through attacking one of the biggest sources of his pride.

1897,">“Liberating the town”
 
🤔 

I’d suggest reading up on the Battle of Berlin if you think that the soldiers involved were portrayed as being “assholes and cruel” in Jojo. It was called “the Rape of Berlin” for a reason, and it was infinitely worse than the film portrays. (And I’m not suggesting that the film needed to go there, but the soldiers in it were definitely not unfairly portrayed.)"
1898,"WW2 wasn't a both sides situation, but there were decent Germans in the German army. There were even (a small number of) decent Germans in the Nazi party - Oscar Schindler was a member, John Rabe was another. There were also war atrocities committed by the allies. Recognition of these facts does not mean that you think the allies were as bad as the Nazis, not a point of view the film takes - it's absolutely anti-Nazi.

The juxtaposition of humour and horror isn't for everyone, and it clearly didn't appeal to you, which is fair enough.

Personally, I found Little Woman decent but not good enough to be on the Best Picture list. It was nowhere near as good as Ladybird, for example. I just think the material it drew on was too stale."
1899,"I would disagree. For one, this is not a film about the holocaust. This is a film about a boy in the Hitler Youth slowly finding out about the reality of Nazi Germany. And he comes to his conclusions without even seeing the death camps (which most Germans only seen after the war, though their existance was assumed). 

As for Rockwell's character: I liked him the way he was. He was somebody not fit for the Nazi ideology, yet he managed to hide this successfully. People like him existed. And I don't think showing him feeds into the clean Wehrmacht myth. They are responsile for plenty of crimes, yet down to the individual soldier we can't say all of them were evil or war criminals.

And while there were jokes until the end, this was a comedy drama after all. In my eyes, it didn't take away from the emotional moments, the gut wrenchers or the depiction of the senseless carnage that was this war. 

And last but not least: Yes WW2 was a ""both sides"" situation. Every war is. Don't get me wrong, I am thankful the allies won. But let's not forget how the Red Army raped through the countryside and the Western Allies commited warcrimes like bombing civilians too. Yes, the greater evil was stopped, no doubt. But that doesn't absolve the other side from their share of evil deeds. 

In any case, I thought the depiction was fair. >!The worst the allied forces did was shoot prisoners. Though we don't exactly know the circumstances, as we only hear the gun shots after Sam Rockwell's character starts fighting his guards.!< And it's not like the movie portraits fascism positively in any way. It's either ridiculed or shown for the dangerous toxic ideology it is. At no point had I the feeling that it glorified Nazi Germany in any way. And I am sensitive to that."
1900,Taste is subjective. And yeah he’s a bad director I’m one of the few that can see past his bullshit and see what a hack is really is.
1901,"One of his comments:

>The main reason why a political party from Europe, 80 years ago is mentioned almost fucking daily is due to decades of propaganda disguised as entertainment 

Definitely a Nazi sympathizer"
1902,"Cry-Baby has 4. Three of which are in a single sentence! Still PG-13. 

Hair has f bombs and titties and dick. Rated **PG** (though, this was prior to the PG-13 rating, but still. TITTIES AND DICK and they didn’t give it the solid R rating). 

There is no “one f bomb per PG-13 movie” rule. That’s just some stupid internet meme. There really aren’t any rules. The MPAA just makes up shit where they want. Gay romance gets rated R where similarly graphic straight romances are PG-13 (only mildly better than decades past when any gay relationship automatically got the movie to NC-17 status (ahem But I’m A Cheerleader would be PG-13 by today’s status, let’s be real)). 

If you want to learn about the MPAA and how ludicrous they are, check out the documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated."
1903,That’s probably my favorite RLM moment of all time
1904,"I had to look it up because I couldn't remember exactly where it was:

1905,Why's that?
1906,"Ahh alright, I thought it only pertained to books, plays etc"
1907,"There is a scale to these things. Nazi's were pure evil. Plain and simple. In a movie trying to condemn them, we did not need to have it portrayed that some nazi's were nice and some allies were cruel.

I never once said that the allies didn't do shit, but that it's not a both sides situation. There is what they did and then there is fucking genocide."
1908,"I've seen this argument and I couldn't disagree more. The holocaust is too important of an event to have any ww2 movie set in Germany that features Jewish characters not be about the holocaust. To say that it isn't is just whitewashing history. That atrocity is too huge and the wound still hasnt healed for us to not acknowledge that.

If you fought in the german army you are a war criminal. This is dangerous territory that we could, even for a second, say ""not all Nazi's were evil"". He partook in indoctrinating hundreds of people into nazism. I'm sorry thats black and white. Even if he did a nice thing here or there it doesn't outweigh that. Saving Jojo doesn't count for shit when the whole reason Jojo is in this position is because of the evil he taught him.

The senseless carnage was completely undercut multiple times by goofy ass jokes like rebel wilson with the kids. 

The war in europe was 100% a black and white situation. There was a country trying to take over the world and exterminate an entire group of people and those trying to stop them. It's not like WW1 or something. Faults on the allies side should be acknowledged in their own right but not in this context and not like that. 

It didn't glorify nazi germany, I never said that. The movie had good intentions. But it botched it's condemnation of them."
1909,"Although I agree in you in that the movie fell flat for me, Waititi's other films (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What we do in the shadows, heck even Ragnarok) are all pretty great so calling yourself ""one of the few that can see his past bullshit"" is just patting yourself on the back for being different and edgy. That being said I agree on the fact that taste is subjective and I very much disagree with the guy above you calling your taste bad because you dislike a director's work."

1930,"At the end, the old lady said that Tokyo used to be mostly under water, and maybe that's the way it's meant to be. All the fish-themed stuff of the water phenomenon also hinted that maybe the place is supposed to be part of the ocean. Other parts of the movie showed that the whole ""sunshine girl"" being sacrificed to preserve dry weather has happened before. Hina and Hodaka chose to break the cycle of having girls sacrificed to keep the area above water, and return it to its natural state."
1931,"I would say something in the line of ""You don't have on sacrifice yourself to change something that can't be changed, something which can't be stopped."" And I'm not sure, but wasn't a large party of the bay of Tokyo under water a few hundreds years ago ? This could also be a way to say ""fuck"" to the previous generation of people who contributed to destroy and deform the environment."

1933,"Actually a source says the miniseries is actually going to tell stories that the film left out or did not explore fully (e.g. the housekeeper’s face, her relationship with the original architect and how she knows of the bunker). 

Source: https://www.indiewire.com/2020/01/parasite-tv-series-bong-joon-ho-six-hour-movie-1202205540/

In my theory, I feel Mark Ruffalo is maybe going to play either (1) one of the Germans who rented the house at the end of the movie, (2) the architect himself (not sure if the architect was actually featured in the movie) or (3) another new character."
1934,"Getting Mark Ruffalo to Star is a power move and must mean the script is good. Since the year 2008 he’s had 18 ‘fresh’ scores on rottentomatoes and 4 ‘rotten’ scores. In fact, since 2013 he’s only had one film score below a 75%. 

Bong Joon Ho is apparently involved so I have a little more hope for this than I did when it was initially announced, but your skepticism is warranted!"
1935,"Saw it yesterday . I very much enjoyed it .  It would have to maintain the same story arc for me to be interested in it. The absolutely  foreign place, people and language is what was so intriguing to me."
1936,"The HBO limited series is supposed to expand the movie, not a total remake. I do not want it to be separate from the movie. I want it to share a common theme at least if it stands under the same title.

I do not necessarily want it to be in Korean unless they cast the exact same people from the movie (which is likely to be imposssible). It would be interesting if it were made in Korean with subtitles though.

I do not want it to introduce other social elements such as racial conflicts. The movie parasite was not meant for that. Parasite be Parasite."
1937,"Interesting. While I dont expect much, it won't detract from the movie so I'll check it out"
1938,"The architect was named Namgoong Hyenja; highly doubtful that's who Ruffalo will be playing. And given that we saw the patriarch of the German family who moved in there, that probably won't be it either. He almost has to be a new character."

1943,"Spotlight, Dark Waters, and Foxcatcher are his only non blockbuster films in the last 6 years and they’re all fantastic. He’s also done a lot of great films in the past. It doesn’t mean the show won’t be shit, but I’d rather have a high-profile actor associated with high quality work than one who isn’t lol"
1944,"Don't really know why you gotta disparage the MCU like that. The movies are well made, and for the sake of the discussion, Ruffalo is always a highlight in those movies (namely Ragnarok and Endgame)."
1945,Intouchables- Great film!

2003,"How the fuck is Red Hot Riding Hood not in the  National  Film Registry?

I get other animated snubs  like Fritz, and The Pink Phink a but Why Red Hot Ridding hood?"
2004,"Yeah, whistling with his fingers and everything."
2005,"Not only that, but I didn't realize how closely this entire scene is referenced. The exterior of the club, rolling up in a stretch limo, the interior of the club, and the ways he reacts at the table (hitting himself with a hammer, whistling) are directly lifted from this."
2006,"King-size, actually. But still, cigarette-related jokes at all."
2007,Sometimes movies just don’t land for whatever reason. Shrug it off and move along. No need to dwell.
2008,"Funnily enough I did something similar and considered asking the same thing on here but figured being seen to step out of line with the critical consensus is just asking for trouble.

I watched Uncut Gems for example and found it unengaging and generally underwhelming and by its conclusion I was bored with watching a guy repeatedly make obvious apocalyptically bad mistakes.

But beyond that I’ve felt the same thing that these films that get all the hype and plaudits are just not landing with me anymore. Not sure why. Perhaps my taste has changed. Perhaps being, for the most part, off social media (dumped Twitter, Insta and FB last year) has meant I’m not aware of some meta narrative behind the scenes that everyone else has been following to add more context to the plaudits. 

What ever it is, it seems to me that something has changed that I can’t put my finger on, either with myself or the way critical media hypes things and the consensus that builds around a property declaring it “BEST ThINg EvARrrr!”.

The net result either way now is that I tend to listen to opinions and if everyone goes in a single direction en masse I automatically drop my expectations by 50% 

I’ve not seen Parasite yet and I’m hoping it will be good and I’m open to it being as amazing as everyone says but based on the past 12 months of “masterpieces” my expectations are currently middling."
2009,"I bought ad Astra because a number of people said that it was an epic space movie.
I was deeply disappointed. 

I no longer trust any of the film critics or recommendations. Like the irish man, i was so bored I turned it off. Their are other movies that were stated as good that I completely disagree with. I don't have a problem with someone liking or enjoying a movie that I don't. but when its stated as best movie of the year. I have a real problem with that."
2010,"Why does it matter what others think?

When you watch a movie, who are you watching for?  And why?

I'm not trying to be glib or put you on the spot.  You might be worried about what others think, you might be worried that you're not growing enough as a person...

If you can elaborate on these details, it would help us put our answers in a meaningful context."
2011,"Nope, there's definitely been a huge decline in the quality of movies over the past decade, that's not to say there aren't some gems hidden in there, I feel pretty much the same way you do, which is why I switched to Asian cinema, lots of high quality Korean and Japanese movies, especially if you haven't seen many"
2012,"Who said it was a great movie? Never heard that before

Regardless, I find that, especially for older movies, IMDB rating is most accurate to how good a movie is (unless you're one of those Canne film festival is true art kind of person). But even for modern films, I think the best films of the year (1917, Ford v Ferrari, Marriage Story, Parasite, Joker are consistently rated 8 or higher)"
2013,"Hard disagree. Paul Thomas Anderson, Tarantino, Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, Coen Brothers, Fincher, Bong Joon Ho, Spike Lee, Guillermo Del Toro, George Miller, Edgar Wright are all still as good as ever, then you have tons of new auteurs like The Safdie Brothers, Jordan Peele, Greta Gerwig, Ari Aster, Taika Waititi, Robert Eggers, Barry Jenkins, Damien Chazelle, Ryan Coogler, Denis Villeneuve, Alex Garland, and more 

Like, if you take all the films these people have made in the last 10 years, that’s a fuck load of great movies lol"
2014,"How did you cobble up all those names but forget Denis Villeneuve, lol"
2015,"Whoops, I put him on there but accidentally deleted him again, fixed!"
2016,The King of Comedy
2017,"Fight Club, 12 Monkeys, Memento, The Machinist, Talented Mr. Ripley, Seven, The Game, Donnie Darko, American Psycho, Fracture, Cape Fear, Requiem For A Dream"
2018,Bad Lieutenant
2019,"If you want bleak but brilliant I'd suggest ""Into the Void"" ""Prozac Nation"" and ""Requiem for a dream"", all hard to watch but excellent."

2026,Would you add night crawler to that list?
2027,Nice list
2028,"All of these, but add Basic Instinct. That movie slaps. She is the perfect female psycho. It also doesn’t hurt how stunningly beautiful Sharon Stone is."
2029,I second this choice...also *Requiem for a Dream*.
2030,I would.
2031,Drive too?
2032,"Film taste is subjective. I greatly appreciate both actors but came away unmoved, theme that was empty, no feelings for the characters.  A film many will say it's arthouse, but empty to me also."
2033,"Just got out of it and thought it was tremendous. All I will say is that if you are the type of cinema goer who laps up the churned out Hollywood superhero, Rock films etc. You’ll probably leave the cinema bored and wondering what went on, until you close your eyes at night to sleep and find yourself wondering what Thomas meant by, ‘ye should have never spilled yee beans lad!!’."
2034,"I keep getting down voted for saying the same thing, but I agree with you. It is pretentious and falls short."
2035,">Eggers has lost me as a fan

If I like a movie someone made and then don't like another movie they made why would this be my conclusion?"
2036,"It’s a good thing people have their pwn opinions, because I respectfully disagree with yours."
2037,"You can have any opinion you want, but if you present it with a title like that and then don't even put in the effort to write more than 3 and a bit lines of content, why should anyone take it seriously?  
What is your intention with something like this?  
The ""story"" moved with pretty much every scene of the film, what you mean is there wasn't much plot which is true. But also not a problem in and of itself, what the film was interested in was to up the stakes (and craziness/atmosphere) with every scene until it climaxes. If that didn't work for you, fine."
2038,"Hmm I just watched the Witch recently and loved it after my friend suggested it and the Lighthouse. Now I’m even more curious, I haven’t watched the Lighthouse yet."
2039,K
2040,"I think there's far more to the film's intentions than you've imagined.  I think it's a great film, made like a work of Art."
2041,"I really hope this won't be my experience. I've yet to watch it, but friend of mine with whom I tend to disagree a lot about films and who disliked The VVitch (somehow) has seen it, and said that he liked it."
2042,The film was not awful the film was amazing your mothers hand jobs are awful
2043,"I agree with it feeling empty

And i hate that when indie cinema sucks it is called arthouse. Nooo ive seen plenty of good arthouse movies"
2044,"its pretty polarizing because of the structure, pacing, and the ambiguity at the end. but all of that was very obviously intentional. it's top 2 movies of the year for me. it's definitely one you'll still be thinking about well after you've seen it."
2045,Buckets of human waste and dripping semen is considered arthouse these days.
2046,"Sounds great! Honestly the fact that it can be polarizing is already a very good sign for me. Two recent fairly polarizing movies that come to mind are Midsommar which I liked and the Suspiria remake which pretty much instantly became my favorite film ever.

I'll try to avoid getting any more information on it until I watch it."
2047,it may be intentional but intention is separate from enjoyment
2048,You're confusing Pornhub with Art House.
2049,"yea, thats why it's a polarizing movie. i found it brilliant, while the person i saw it with didn't like it."
2050,Actually the film director is confused.
2051,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/esvjmz/official_discussion_the_gentlemen_spoilers
2052,"Guy Ritchie's best crime film. Clever, funny, beautifully paced. Sharp performances from Grant, Hunnam and Farrell. The dialogue was so well done. A real love of language on display. The Gentlemen is a blast."
2053,Hugh Grant was great but The Gentlemen was no Snatch
2054,Snatch is the GOAT
2055,"Rango is a mashup of old westerns, Chinatown and The Road Warrior, which is a Mad Max movie from 1982, also a George Miller classic."
2056,Nicely considered. Good job.
2057,""" We don't take kindly to strangers round here""."
2058,Holy shit...they got Rango’d
2059,Both movies borrow heavily from the same (much older) movies.
2060,"""Furry Road""?

Great observations!

I've said a similar thing about Skyfall and Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows (seriously, they're the same film)

I love Rango, it's animation is on another level completely. Even recent Pixar releases (with the exception of possibly TS 4) can't match the level of character detail (and Rango is now 9 years old)."
2061,"I loved rango, can't say I felt the same about fury road"
2062,The visual comedy in Rango is great!
2063,I'm with you there.
2064,I'm with both of you.
2065,It's about a blue hedgehog that runs very fast. Didn't expect it to be a work of art. When it comes to movies like this all I really want to know if it's going to entertain my family of all ages when they to come visit me next week.
2066,"This is just one review. 

Amd this review couldn't be more snobby than it was. This guy is sad."
2067,"i miss gene shalit and other reviewers who will tell you to go see a stupid but fun movie, and just mention you should check your brain at the door first"
2068,"The argument that it’s a kid movie in defence of this movie’s quality doesn’t make sense to me. Many kids films can hold up in quality for kids and adults alike.

I loved Sonic as a kid nonetheless so will probably see it."
2069,"Holy shit. He actually expected Sonic to be an Oscar film. I feel sorry for this guy's kids. 

What a pretentious-sounding reviewer. I'm still gonna watch it, it sounds fun. Others have praised it and I'm sure I'm gonna have a blast watching it. Some film reviewers are really fond of blowing hot air off their asses."
2070,"Wow, people are super defensive for this movie without even seeing it. Fast & Furious and similar stuff gets shit on because it's nothing more than ""dumb fun"", yet when Sonic does this, it's great? Alrighty then."
2071,"Of course it's not gonna rock. It's *Sonic the Hedgehog*, not fucking District 9. This film isn't going to be layered with subtext or a deeper meaning to analyze. It's a family film video game adaptation from a first time director. You can't seriously expect it to be award worthy.

Film's been getting decent reception from those who've seen it early. Fingers crossed it ends up being at least okay."
2072,No shit. It's Sonic.
2073,Is Jim Carrey at least funny enough to make the movie worth watching? Because that's honestly the only reason I want to go see it at all. I've been starving for more Jim Carrey doing his over the top Shtick for years.
2074,breaking news: paint-by-numbers nostalgia bait movie is generic
2075,"This was never going to be a “good” movie, even if they re-did the CGI so Sonic stop looking like your children’s sleep paralysis demon."
2076,Well this movie is definitely gonna do that.
2077,Yeah. movies are just like Pokemon. They're doing battles for the powerless peasantry who have no one else to defend them.
2078,I just love how the film starts and ends at the base of a tree.
2079,Really nice summary. Thank you for taking the time to put this together. One lone person on the inter webs appreciates it kindly.
2080,And then you add the insane work from roger deakins to make it one shot. The cinemaography is incredible in this movie.
2081,I was blown away when I watched this film. A true masterpiece.
2082,"I literally wept through half the film BOTH times that I saw it.

I wish so much that it had gotten more recognition."
2083,It’s ahead of its time.
2084,A film has never affected me in that way before. I can't stand that the film and Mendes weren't recognized more in the US.
