Abstract: States adopt minimum wages to improve workers’ economic circumstances and wellbeing. Many, but not all, studies find evidence of health benefits from higher minimum wages. This study used a rigorous “triple difference” strategy to identify the associations between state minimum wages and adult obesity, body mass index (kg/m2), hypertension, diabetes, fair or poor health, and serious psychological distress. National Health Interview Survey data (2008–2015) on adults ages 25-64 (n = 131,430) were linked to state policies to estimate the prevalence odds ratio or mean difference in these outcomes associated with a $1 increase in current and two-year lagged minimum wage among less-educated adults overall and by gender, race/ethnicity, and age. In contrast to prior studies, there was no association between current minimum wage and health; however, two-year lagged minimum wage was positively associated with the likelihood of obesity (prevalence odds ratio: 1.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.16) and with elevated body mass index (mean difference: 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.04, 0.49). In subgroup models, current and two-year lagged minimum wage were associated with a higher likelihood of obesity among male and non-White or Hispanic adults. The associations with hypertension also varied by gender and the timing of the exposure."

Abstract: We study how electoral incentives affect policy choices on secondary issues, which only minorities of voters care intensely about. We develop a model in which office and policy motivated politicians vote in favor [of] or against regulations on these issues. We derive conditions under which politicians flip flop, voting according to their policy preferences at the beginning of their terms, but in line with the preferences of single-issue minorities as they approach re-election. To assess the evidence, we study U.S. senators' votes on gun control, environment, and reproductive rights. In line with the model's predictions, we find that i) election proximity has a pro-gun effect on Democratic senators and a pro-environment effect on Republican senators; these effects arise for senators who ii) are not retiring, iii) do not hold safe seats, and iv) represent states where the single-issue minority is of intermediate size. Also in line with our theory, election proximity does not affect votes on reproductive rights, due to the presence of single-issue minorities on both sides.

6,"The write-up misses the main point of the article, which has to do with the spatial and temporal statistical nature of singling in the neocortex during 'consciousness'. The stimulation is a way to drive the particular frequency (50Hz) across cortical regions. The idea that the thalamus supports wakefulness and sleep is not new, nor is the idea that stimulation can wake up an animal. For instance, you can get a partial awakening with tactile stimulation (pinch). Nurses use the sternal rub to arouse people. This information goes through that thalamus before the cortex. The thalamus is involved in consciousness like a router is involved in the internet - a necessary relay, but not the source of content."

""It's unfortunate to be thinking about dating abuse as we approach one of the most romantic days of the year, Valentine's Day. However, it is clear that digital dating abuse affects a meaningful proportion of teenagers, and we need to model and educate youth on what constitutes a healthy, stable relationship and what betrays a dysfunctional, problematic one."" 

Considering that women have been found to be equally aggressive towards their male partners or even more aggressive (there's not enough research to say which it is yet), it makes sense that males will get the brunt of it. 


> Results of the study, published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, showed that more than one-quarter (28.1 percent) of teens who had been in a romantic relationship at some point in the previous year said they had been the victim of at least one form of digital dating abuse. These included: whether their significant other looked through the contents of their device without permission; kept them from using their device; threatened them via text; posted something publicly online to make fun of, threaten, or embarrass them; and posted or shared a private picture of them without permission.

> In addition, more than one-third (35.9 percent) had been the victim at least one form of traditional (offline) dating abuse (i.e., they were pushed, grabbed or shoved; hit or threatened to be hit; called names or criticized, or prevented from doing something they wanted to do).

> Interestingly, males were significantly more likely to have experienced digital dating abuse (32.3 percent) compared to females (23.6 percent), and more likely to experience all types of digital dating abuse, and were even more likely to experience physical aggression. No other differences emerged with respect to demographic characteristics such as sexual orientation, race and age. 

Female aggression is normally believed to be less physical than male aggression by researchers, so this certainly is an interesting result."
34,"As the parent to a 15 year old girl, I can attest to this being the wild-f-ing-west when it comes to the integration of tech into their lives. I can't say I've seen her be abusive to her romantic interests online, but I've definitely seen it pointed at her. There is so much happening online with this generation that we dumb ass X'ers are not aware of that it would be amusing were it not terrifying. Things happen instantly with them, and the effects of those instantaneous actions can go across an entire school within literally ~~5 minutes~~ seconds. In that time, if you ask the kid involved, their lives can ""be ruined"".

Dating, in particular, is an entirely different ballgame from when I was in HS. You have a disagreement at school with your bf/gf? Gotta wait till you can get phone permission to continue it, or table it until the next day - when cooler heads prevail. Now? You're always in touch (until the parents shut the phone down for the day) so those interactions are constant and ever changing. And when they go sideways, they go very, very sideways. Their texted conversations under duress are brutal because they're not looking at each other face to face. 

Anyone that has ever parented a young teenage girl knows firsthand how f-ing crazy those people are emotionally. I have little doubt that she's lashed out at a boy that she feels treated her in a way she didn't appreciate and I can only imagine what that lashing out entailed. Again - it's the instant-access that social media allows that is the issue here. There is no 'cooling off' period and it's 24/7

It sucks for kids today. Tech hasn't made their lives easier. IMHO, its made it harder, and its made them far more susceptible to damage from peers."
35,"Also studies on violence in relationships show that men are the victim more often.

What saddens me about it, and tell me if you feel otherwise, is that it appears to be seen less of a problem if men are the victims than if something happens to women.

Especially for young boys today that must be devastating. And I would not be surprised if it was one of the reasons why boys commit suicide 4 times more often than girls."

47,">And I would not be surprised if it was one of the reasons why boys commit suicide 4 times more often than girls.

I was confirming that anecdotally you are right. I run a support service for men and have had many victims of DV disclose a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.

This is partly due to them being denied care and harmful interventions by the police and child protection services, due to the men being the presumed perpetrators.

My country has about 600 make success each year. There are on average 10 adult male and 14 adult female family violence deaths. 

I'm claiming that there are at least 24 men killing themselves annually due to being the victim of DV, with that being about 5 percent of annual suicide deaths. Seems very likely to me."

>Abstract
>	Strategies to reduce, halt, and reverse global declines in marine biodiversity are needed urgently. We reviewed, coded, and synthesized historical and contemporary marine conservation strategies of the Kitasoo/Xai’xais First Nation in British Columbia, Canada to show how their approaches work. We assessed whether the conservation actions classification system by the Conservation Measures Partnership was able to encompass this nation’s conservation approaches. All first‐order conservation actions aligned with the Kitasoo/Xai’xais First Nation’s historical and contemporary marine conservation actions; hereditary chief management responsibility played a key role. A conservation ethic permeates Kitasoo/Xai’xais culture, and indigenous resource management and conservation existed historically and remains strong despite extreme efforts by colonizers to suppress all indigenous practices. The Kitasoo/Xai’xais’s embodiment of conservation actions as part of their worldview, rather than as requiring actions separate from everyday life (the norm in nonindigenous cultures), was missing from the conservation action classification system. The Kitasoo/Xai’xais are one of many indigenous peoples working to revitalize their governance and management authorities. With the Canadian government’s declared willingness to work toward reconciliation, there is an opportunity to enable First Nations to lead on marine and other conservation efforts. Global conservation efforts would also benefit from enhanced support for indigenous conservation approaches, including expanding the conservation actions classification to encompass a new category of conservation or sacredness ethic."

One can certainly care deeply about a subset of these but less for others, as our political affiliations indicate. And different religions focus on different moral axes:  Haredi Judaism focuses on sanctity and loyalty, whereas Quakerism on care and liberty.

There's a extensive literature about disgust, the ""behavioral immune system"", and its relation to politics, though less on Purity-axis religious morality.

Many atheists/agnostics rate high on the care, fairness and liberty axes. The nature of their (*our*) self-selection means that in more religious nations they (*we*) aren't representative of the general population on the authority and loyalty axes. They become blind spots (to the extent I have difficulty comprehending them as moral axes at all).

65,"# Abstract

>This study finds that the online “fake news” game, *Bad News*, can confer psychological resistance against common online misinformation  strategies across different cultures. The intervention draws on the  theory of psychological inoculation: analogous to the process of medical  immunization, we find that “prebunking,” or preemptively warning and  exposing people to weakened doses of misinformation, can help cultivate  “mental antibodies” against fake news. We conclude that social impact  games rooted in basic insights from social psychology can boost immunity  against misinformation across a variety of cultural, linguistic, and  political settings.

# Questions about inferring causation from the data:

1. Was this a pre-post design (in which everyone receives the “treatment” and there is no random assignment to a control group) or a randomized controlled design (randomly assigning people to a “treatment” and “control” condition)?
2. If this is pre-post rather than randomized, then can one conclude that the game can “confer"", ""help"", or ""boost"" anything?
3. If we cannot infer such causation, then what can we infer instead?"
66,"My biggest issue is not the pre-post design, but that they ignore basic tenants of learning and skill acquisition literature.

>We showed participants (*n*= 134 to *n*= 379 for the full pre-post survey) 3 fake and 3 credible (control) Twitter posts before and after playing the game and asked them to rate their reliability on a 1-7 Likert scale

There are transient practice and true learning effects. Transient effects of practice influence measurements immediately after practice but then fade. We don't know from this study if these effects persist into the future when reading fake news. If not, then we'd have to play a game before reading the news everyday. They need to conduct a transfer test to understand how ingrained these results are to participant reading/understanding strategies."

69,"These are valid questions!

>If this is pre-post rather than randomized, then can one conclude that the game can “confer"", ""help"", or ""boost"" anything?

What are the threats to validity here and plausible third variables? Time is unlikely as this was asynchronous. They did control for individual level variables (education, gender, politics). Pre-post isn't great but I don't think this is worthless either...

They note ""randomized trials with the English version of the game have been conducted (Basol et al., 2020), highlighting similar results across diverse groups (Basol et al., 2020)."" So the new information here may be that a study conducted across many nationalities (Swedish, German, Greek, and Polish) is consistent with randomized trials. Not as ideal as a randomized international set of trials, but still some level of value in a world of research where money is a real constraint on any study."

> A major challenge college students face is retaining the knowledge they acquire in their classes, especially in cumulative disciplines such as engineering, where ultimate success depends on long-term retention of foundational content. Cognitive psychologists have recently recommended various techniques educators might use to increase retention. One technique ( spaced retrieval practice) involves extending opportunities to retrieve course content beyond a customarily short temporal window following initial learning. Confirming the technique's utility requires demonstrating that it increases retention in real classroom settings, with commonly encountered educational content, and that gains endure into subsequent semesters. We manipulated spaced versus massed retrieval practice in a precalculus course for engineering students and followed a subset of students who proceeded into a calculus class the following semester. Spacing versus massing was manipulated within- and between-subjects. Within-subjects, students retained spaced content better than massed content in the precalculus course. Between-subjects, students for whom some retrieval practice was spaced, compared to those for whom all practice was massed, performed better on the final exam in the precalculus class and on exams in the calculus class. These findings suggest that spaced retrieval practice can have a meaningful, long-lasting impact on educational outcomes."

82,Globally or in one particular country?
83,"The public has long thought that handguns are more responsible for human deaths, including suicides, than long guns such as rifles and shotguns, which have been believed to be more commonly used for hunting or protection from wild animals. But now, in an analysis of data from 16 years of gun suicides in Maryland, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers found that long guns were used more often in suicides by kids and teens than by adults, and were more commonly used in suicide by people in rural counties.

The researchers say their findings, published Feb. 3 in Injury Epidemiology, suggest that adopting safety measures for rifles or shotguns may prevent suicides, particularly among young people and rural-area residents.

“Our goal as clinicians at Johns Hopkins Medicine is to save lives, and it’s concerning to see that it’s not just handguns, but long guns that are used commonly in youth suicide,” says Paul Nestadt, M.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “Many of the safety protections that we have in place around the country typically don’t apply to long guns, and the data suggest that our strategy needs to be modified.”
In many states, there is no minimum age for owning long guns, and federal background checks are only required if buying from a licensed gun dealer. Requirements for permits and safety courses for rifles vary from state to state.

You can tell that they are trying to get results from the study that would back up this claim when you see the keywords such as rural county and suicide and do not give an amount of suicides by handgun or long gun in urban counties. All these factors would benefit their “findings” aka what their bias would be. The 60% of 3k suicides by long gun in rural counties could be way less than the 17% of suicides by long gun in urban counties just because of population density and the amount of suicides in urban areas, which both sets of data are not provided in the study either.

Controlled burns take a ton of prep time, on the ground work and crossing of fingers the weather cooperates on the day of the burn. It's not possible to do controlled burns in an unmaintained eucalyptus grove understory, it requires hundreds of man hours prepping, removing lower limbs, hauling the cut brush and chipping it. 

There's also the issue of liability and jumping containment. You need permission to do burns on private lands and there will always be pushback from the community from an air quality perspective.

There are also environmental concerns. You have to make sure you aren't burning sensitive habitat or causing mass ecological damage. 

Then there is the whole timing aspect. You have to schedule crews and set the burn timeframe weeks, if not months in advance. If the weather doesn't cooperate, you're screwed and it's a pile of public moneys down the drain.

Most agencies and governments aren't against controlled burns as some deflection of climate change, it's just a really difficult and costly approach to mitigating fire risk. 

A much more effective method that is less labor intensive is to create shaded fuel breaks, keep grasses down, allow burn piles and force property owners to maintain and clear an effective defensible space area. 

The reality is that government is never going to have the resources or ability to mitigate fire risk in communities, with or without climate change. Private property owners have to step up and work together to make safer communities and understand just how much needs to be cleared to make their properties safe."

162,"**Abstract**
> In the 1990s, prominent biologists and journalists predicted that by 2020 each of us would carry a genome card, which would allow physicians to access our entire genome sequence and routinely use this information to diagnose and treat common and debilitating conditions. This is not yet the case. Why not? Common and debilitating diseases are rarely caused by single-gene mutations, and this was recognized before these genome card predictions had been made. Debilitating conditions, including common psychiatric disorders, are typically caused either by rare mutations or by complex interactions of many genes, each having a small effect, and epigenetic, environmental, and microbial factors. In such cases, having a complete genome sequence may have limited utility in diagnosis and treatment. Genome sequencing technologies have transformed biological research in many ways, but had a much smaller effect than expected on treatments of common diseases. Thus, early proponents of genome sequencing effectively “mis-promised” its benefits. One reason may be that there are incentives for both biologists and journalists to tell simple stories, including the idea of relatively simple genetic causation of common, debilitating diseases. These incentives may have led to misleading predictions, which to some extent continue today. Although the Human Genome Project has facilitated biological research generally, the mis-promising of medical benefits, at least for treating common and debilitating disorders, could undermine support for scientific research over the long term."

165,"Thought this spacex email was relevant as it addresses similar points. 

There is a creeping tendency to use made up acronyms at SpaceX. Excessive use of made up acronyms is a significant impediment to communication and keeping communication good as we grow is incredibly important. Individually, a few acronyms here and there may not seem so bad, but if a thousand people are making these up, over time the result will be a huge glossary that we have to issue to new employees. No one can actually remember all these acronyms and people don't want to seem dumb in a meeting, so they just sit there in ignorance. This is particularly tough on new employees.

That needs to stop immediately or I will take drastic action - I have given enough warning over the years. Unless an acronym is approved by me, it should not enter the SpaceX glossary. If there is an existing acronym that cannot reasonably be justified, it should be eliminated, as I have requested in the past.

For example, there should be not ""HTS"" [horizontal test stand] or ""VTS"" [vertical test stand] designations for test stands. Those are particularly dumb, as they contain unnecessary words. A ""stand"" at our test site is obviously a test stand. VTS-3 is four syllables compared with ""Tripod"", which is two, so the bloody acronym version actually takes longer to say than the name!

The key test for an acronym is to ask whether it helps or hurts communication. An acronym that most engineers outside of SpaceX already know, such as GUI, is fine to use. It is also ok to make up a few acronyms/contractions every now and again, assuming I have approved them, e.g. MVac and M9 instead of Merlin 1C-Vacuum or Merlin 1C-Sea Level, but those need to be kept to a minimum."

The jargon is often a word with a discreet meaning that needs to be discrete because it's a complicated subject with similar terms that need to not be confused with each other. It is very easy to get a definition, and if that definition contains jargon then it is easy to drill further down until it is understandable.

Someone confused over something like 'inflammable', and unwilling to check the meaning, should simply not be involved with anything inflammable. It may be safest in that instance that they were disinterested, and by not wanting to check the meaning they almost ARE bad at science.

There is a purpose and an audience when journals are written.

To explain and write a paper about a certain particular polymer chemistry for example requires a ridiculous amount of complex term and complex arguments. This is not jargon even though 80% of people could not read it.

From when I started school years ago there is no possible way I could understand the large majority of academic papers but further into my degree I gained more and more confidence and understanding specialized to my field.

A student who may know exactly how to fix said problem in plain English may have a tough time when they aren't well versed in the vocabulary.

I find that a lot of students struggle through topics significantly less when they have a good understanding of the jargon involved. I have even unofficially tested this by looking at the scores of quizzes written in jargon versus those written in plain English.

As a result, I periodically ask my students to explain medical concepts in simple terms. I find that those who can do this well tend to have significantly higher rates of first time passing in both the course and their certification exams."
204,"As a critique of the study, the way they offered definitions of the jargon was by having readers mouse over the confusing words. I think that's actually a bad way to do it, and may contribute to readers feeling alienated.

When I write for a non-scientific audience and need to use jargon from my field, I define it as best as I can within the text just before or after introducing the word.

If the word is introduced in the text itself, it's part of the flow and invites the reader to learn the jargon. When the reader has to mouse over it, that forces them to acknowledge that they don't know the word (which is frustrating) and breaks up the flow of reading.

I would be interested in a follow-up study where a piece of jargon is introduced in a more natural way vs the method they used here."

229,"As I've always been told, the moment that you as a researcher use the phrase ""dumb it down"", it's because you yourself don't understand the topic/work enough to explain it to the current audience. If you truly understand something, your explanations should be an ever evolving dance flowing from complex to common comparison laden to offer applicability to the unexposed dependent upon your audience. While people do have a propensity to doing and saying stupid things, the truth is that almost all people have the capacity to understand and learn if something is presented properly. Whenever possible, dont shift the blame to the audience, instead look at how to better relate your work to others.

However, in certain publications, it's important to use all the correct terminology. If I'm reading a publication in JBC and someone writes ""this protein has a sugar on it"", that's not good enough. Is it a GAG, is it an N- or O-glycan, complex or hybrid or high mannose? There is a place for proper jargon and terminology, not everything can or should be made coherent to someone not exposed to the field because at a certain point too many details get thinned out if substitutes that are more common are used. It's important to maintain a balance and to present properly to the audience. I wouldn't expect non-research oriented person to like many methodology papers, but that's not their purpose and someone shouldn't read those as a general application to science. That's what Nature and Science papers are for, big science and generally very good science for a wide audience. If interest is piqued then go into specific journals of target fields like journal of biological chemistry or journal of cell biology."

Although we cannot deny it, but jargons serve a purpose. After learning about something, you would want to box it up into a word or two to be able to communicate it to someone who already knows it. You wouldn't want to say ""the tendency of an object to stay in motion when it is in motion and tendency to stay still when it is still"" all the time when you can just say inertia. Kind of like ""let x = ..."" in math."
250,"I started really trying to change this a couple of years ago - in medicine and neuroresearch this can be extremely bad.

I think one problem is that many words have precise technical definitions and clear thinking neccesitates these to be used sometimes - the way around that is that you NEVER use jargon to someone who doesn’t know what it means, without adequate explanation. 

Sometimes it can be done really elegantly  and in an interesting manner. I think the great talents of science education (like Feynman for one) are a great guiding stick."

The first paragraph of the article states:

""When scientists and others use their specialized jargon terms while communicating with the general public, the effects are much worse than just making what they’re saying hard to understand.""

Nothing there implies that the article is trying to censor anything. It's not talking about writing intended for peer review."
275,Censoring? It's a study about how laypeople respond to jargon. No one suggested that experts should no longer use jargon when communicating to experts.
276,"I'll weigh-in as someone who wrote articles in science, health, space and technology for more than a handful of years.

I had an editor sending me about 8-9 new studies a day I had to attempt my best to read, understand what they're claiming, and find a way to make a 300 word article about it so it would show up in SEO on Google. It was not easy jumping from cell cancer research to a new quasar discovered to a new Samsung patent all in just a few hours.

You're 100% right, there is no way I could have attempted to truly understand what I was writing about, I was having to wrap my mind around months to years of research in a matter of an hour or so, then attempt my best to translate what I learned to the public. 

The alternative, though, is I also wrote about a lot of research that was never picked up by other news outlets. So our ability to produce high volumes like that is a bit of a catch 22 in that it makes it difficult for journalistic quality control, but also helped highlight research that no one else may have even care to write about. Weird seeing the bee colony collapses take headlines when I was writing about those studies more than a decade ago."
277,Scientists often dont realize how smart they are being.
278,"I agree with you. And while I don't doubt the findings of the study I'm not so sure the answer is to stop using jargon in science journalism altogether. Certainly there is a market for a more accessible and easily understood way to connect with what's going on in the science world and I think that should stay (and improve), but to me what this study really highlights is that the average reaction to something people don't understand right away is negative. We should be trying to figure out why that is and trying to find ways to encourage people to do research more often when they don't understand something. It's okay to not understand something! That is just an opportunity to learn something new. And to be clear I'm not advocating that everyone spend all of their free time researching science. But if someone was interested in a topic enough to read an article but didn't understand a few terms then use that interest as motivation to learn."

Sure. Are you offering to chip in for salary?"
280,">	Can we get better science ‘journalists’ before we worry about censoring field sensitive terms?

Yes. You start by having a healthy consumer market for paid journalism comprised of customers who are willing to pay a premium for well written science content. Then you pay a premium wage to attract top talent who will produce that content for you. If there is more demand for content, you hire more journalists. 

The problem is that everyone wants high quality content but few are willing to pay for it. So you get stuck with clickbait science journalism because that’s what actually pays."
281,"I made this point elsewhere. If we dumb down scientific journalism to appeal to folks who dont want to put in the effort to learn the terms and learn about the subject, then whats the point? Theyre not there to learn, theyre there to be entertained. Which is fine enough, but thats not the goal of most scientific journals- the goal is to educate. If were dumbing down to the point where its no longer educational or even true is some cases, why bother?

And this isnt calling people stupid. Anyone could learn this stuff if they wanted to. And its fine that people dont want to. But leave the true learning for people who actually are invested in learning it.


Eta: its like steak. Some people eat their steak gray and dry with ketchup and all kinds of seasonings, and do so with relatively expensive cuts. Thats fine- but that means that youre not a person who really likes steak and youre wasting your time and momey consuming a ""higher quality"" product in such a transformational way, you know? Buy a cheaper cut or animal and youll have the result.

It sounds elitist but it really isnt. Theres no real barrier to entry to science other than desire to learn. Anyone can learn and enjoy different branches of science if they chose and no ones going to stop them"
282,"I kind of understand their plight though...a good scientific study outlines the scope of the study and materials used, the actual data, and the author's interpretation on what the data suggest with respect to the current theoretical framework and limitations from the study environment.

283,"This.

287,Was going to say. It's not like scientists use scientific language simply because they like long and fancy words (though that may be true in many cases).

Kids loved it! I had numerous questions from kids that were interested in science.

TL;DR: talking to someone outside the field or maybe younger? Explain things, talk to them, make them curious. Talking to someone who is an expert in your field or wants to learn a lot more? Go on! Use the most accurate terminology"
289,"That being said, outside of sciences some organizations do use a completely made-up jargon to obfuscate things. I'm French, and our Ministry of Education is infamous in this regard."
290,"As a scientist, I politely disagree. When you’re writing in a high level journal like Nature, Science, PNAS, etc, scientists in other disciplines might want to read your work. If it’s full of jargon, they’ll probably lose interest (I do). 

For example, I have a paper coming out about where insects wings came from, where I use as little jargon as possible: Insects evolved from crustaceans, so one theory is that wings evolved from side lobes on the proximal part of crustacean legs, for example gills or the plates that cover the gills. Another theory is that insect wings grew out of the back, and did not evolve from any structure in crustaceans . I used CRISPR cas9 genetic engineering to knock out leg patterning genes in a crustacean, then compared my results to previously published results in insects. I found that the legs of crustaceans and insects can be aligned in a one to one fashion. However, crustaceans have two additional proximal leg segments relative to insects, which suggested that insects had incorporated these two leg segments into their body wall. So I compared the expression patterns of two other genes, and found that they are expressed in the proximal leg of my crustacean but in the body wall of insects. Therefore, it appears that insects incorporated two ancestral leg segments into the body wall, which moved the lobes (gills or plates) up into the back to later form insects wings. 

You and everyone reading this likely understood everything I just said.  But if instead I had written the following, it would be correct, but even people in my lab who work on slightly different things would have trouble understanding it. But I’m generally very anti jargon, because I don’t want my audience to be tripping over new jargon even for a millisecond, which might make them miss important components of my line of reasoning, which then might make them dismiss my ideas or not fully understand them. 


Insects evolved from crustaceans. The paranotal theory proposes that insect wings evolved from paranotal lobes, while the exite theory proposes that wings evolved from crustacean exites. I used CRISPR cas9 to knock out five leg gap genes in the amphipod crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, and compared my results to previously published functional studies in insects. I found that the distal six podomeres of crustaceans and insects are homologous. However, the crustacean precoxa and coxa are not accounted for in insects, which suggested that these two ancestral podomeres now form the pleurites of the insects pleuron . I compared the expression patterns of genes expressed in the Drosophila notum , and found that they are expressed in the precoxa and coxa of Parhyale but in the pleuron of Tribolium. Therefore, it appears that insects incorporated two ancestral podomeres into the pleuron, which moved the exites dorsally to later form insects wings."
291,"The use of jargon simplifies speech when the audience is well versed in the matter but it makes it practicaly impossible for someone who doesn't know the meaning to understand. You can be scientifically accurate without using jargon. At the very least, the jargon should be explained to the audience in an introductory section."
292,"Jargon is about compression, not accuracy. Non-scientific fields have plenty of jargon that is less specific than a plain description. Acronyms being the best example."

Economics is such a necessarily political field that it's crucial that we all discuss and debate it. And economics actually had a long period of being fairly intelligible to a literate reader, but jargon and maths have penetrated the field over the last few decades in a similar way that Latin became the written language of the Catholic Church. And this change hasn't made it any more scientific or accurate as the harder sciences it is clearly attempting to ape. The result, in mediaeval religion and in modern economics is the same: laymen are fenced off from the debate, whether that result is accidental or intended (I suspect a bit of both)."

308,">I'm not a scientist. not that big into politics either but i know enough jargon to not feel dumb when reading the topics.

That depends on what you're reading. For real technical journals, there will always be jargon you don't know if it's not your field. You don't know enough jargon to really understand them. You can't know all the jargon.

Now, the feeling dumb part is as much or more about your response to realizing you don't know something as it is about not knowing something. That is, realizing you don't know something doesn't mean you're dumb or should feel you are dumb."
309,"Did you even read the article?

It matters because the public is increasingly uninformed and disinterested in topics when those topics are communicated using language they don't understand. It's pretty simple, really.

There's a serious need for honest and knowledgeable people who can write about these topics to bridge that gap."

“When you have a difficult time processing the jargon, you start to counter-argue. You don’t like what you’re reading. But when it is easier to read, you are more persuaded and you’re more likely to support these technologies,” she said.

“You can see how important it is to communicate clearly when you’re talking about complex science subjects like climate change or vaccines.”

It's unrealistic to expect the average person to understand research written for people with PhDs. If you expect public support then you have to be prepared to explain your work to the public in terms they understand."
314,">Yes, but do we really want more people ""thinking that they're good at science""

Yes, we want more people understanding science and taking an interest in it.

Actually writing undigestable garbage full of jargon, overly complex terms and language an ordinary person never encounters leads to that. Anti Vax and anti climate change stuff is written at a LOW reading level. When you try to counter what someone can read, with a bunch of stuff they can't, they only have one side to listen to."
315,Conversely some arenas can only be transversed with the correct jargon
316,"I took a class in it - ""science writing for general audiences.""

You have to know how to read an original paper, translate it into plain English, try to condense the significance of the study into something interesting to a non-scientist, and if you absolutely *must* use a jargoney term, be careful to explain it.

*Science Friday* is one of my favorite podcasts and does an excellent job at all of the above."

Both types of language have their place, and I fully agree that using complex language for its own sake is pointless. But to be frank, there's a reason jargon existsm it's a concise way of communicating a specific thing."
320,"One thing you should factor in.. is that if you are easy to read and understand, perhaps you are also opening yourself up to more criticism from people who now understand you..

322,"How to write papers:

2. Write sensible explanation
3. Reformulate it with lots of Greek letters and make it about how everything is a ""path integral"" or some other cool math.

330,"Not the person you were asking, but I can comment on industry.  I work as an engineer in a life sciences company.

For me it's not about dropping the lingo entirely but adding a very quick lead-in section.  This can be like 1 paragraph or a couple of pages going into the background, context, and rationale starting from the most general explanation of the concept and adding layers of detail until you ramp into full depth.  If you start using extremely specific terms, define them when you first use them.  For example even if I use a really basic engineering term like ""duty cycle,"" I will give a 1/2 sentence definition of how I'm using it which costs me almost nothing and prevents my reader from having to open a tab to a dictionary and break their whole train of thought.

It doesn't actually add much length, only in the framing sections of the paper.  It makes the paper much more inviting to read for people outside of your exact niche.  It also helps you frame and organize your own thoughts in a breezy way before getting down into the forest of detail."

Science is complicated, and simplifying it rarely works very well. Go into any science news sub, the comments are filled with people lamenting the click bait and reductionist explanation of the article. If people want to read about science they should be ready to actually learn a little bit, and that includes getting familiar with the terminology and concepts.
A lot of science journalism reduces concepts to the point where the title is essentially all you need to understand. Depends on the journal, but the ones for mass audiences are next to useless and IMO have no business being targeted to adults.

You could describe all of those in the list, but constantly doing it would inflate your work to unreadable lengths.

Naturally, you can also use jargon unnecessarily, as in your second example, where colloquial language already possesses sufficient precision to describe and disambiguate your statement.  This should be avoided for accessibility's sake.  Depending on your field, some jargon may be more or less necessary - in maths, you get used to papers being composed entirely of jargon because the alternative is either saying nothing of use or including entire textbooks in your papers - but there will certainly still be many cases where there is no reasonable alternative but to use jargon."

Its not that the writing changed its that the field did, as better methods became available where the theory and postulation can actually be tested much more rigorously.

Its the Field moving from a soft social science like psychology towards a hard science like physics (it likely won't end up there but will likely end up more maths and data heavy then many hard sciences), where the field is almost entirely maths, data, and models.

This isn't the failing of the scientific community but rather the failing of the community and organisations that link them to general public. Be it teachers, Journalist and science communicators like Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse Tyson.

This was actually presented as a negative outcome imo and actually supports the use of ""jargon"".

So long as a topic is simplified for the general public they will almost always support it because they feel like they understand it due to lack of jargon. That honestly seems pretty scary to me at least."

He said even in these journals where the audience is expected to be pretty knowledgeable, he noticed a marked drop in contact/comments/interactions (this was in the early 90s) as the average reading grade equivalent rose above 9th grade. He was just using the built in analytics tool in word, but has helped me in my writing.

There were so many factually incorrect reports on red meat that were based on extremely poor research that most certainly have had an impact on the public’s perception of red meat, and meat in general. 

In fact, I’m sure some organizations fund studies that rely on a misinterpretation of their studies through the media."

I take complicated Technical Papers™ and have to “translate” them into less technical versions for  a number of audiences, ranging from the general public (where you have to assume almost 0 prior knowledge) to coworkers in a different department (where you assume they know acronyms etc, just not the context of that particular thing). 

Do you know who ruin it? THE TECHNICAL PEOPLE. I was a technical person (researcher) before so, hey, I hear ya. Sometimes you do have to be overly specific to avoid confusion. But it breaks my heart how many great articles have been ruined because someone, somewhere, insists that it would be misleading to compare X to Y in a particular concept, even though using the literal description absolutely will alienate everyone who isn’t immediately in the know. If only humans weren’t dumb enough to take things at face value literally all of the time, we could get away with being so much more pedagogical."

390,"The other end of the spectrum is being able to translate well for the layman, but without reducing it so far down as to be patronizing.  It's a fine balance."
391,"IMO, it is a good idea to keep articles between 500-1000 words, explaining the thing in general terms, then provide a link to a more detailed news article about the thing, and another link to the actual article. 

Because 90% of people will just read the basic thing (and if it takes over 3-5 minutes to read with relatively little knowledge of the subject, people will just stop), 9.9% will go to the more detailed article (maybe 30 minute read) and if lucky, 0.1% of the readers will go into the actual science behind it. 

It's simple, cause most people have basic knowledge and are curious, but overestimate their intelligence (I definitely do) and think they're stupid if they can't understand a few words. Then the minority have some knowledge and know they aren't that knowledgeable about this thing, but want to learn and because of that will spend time to educate themselves. 

Then there are the people that actually understand what's being said. And they want to learn because it might help them in their fields. And they are the ones reading the actual science behind the articles. 

This doesn't include the people that only read the headline, which I would estimate to be between 80-90% of people."
392,Science Vs. by Gimlet is a really good science podcast as well
393,"This is pretty much why science journalism is dying. Someone with a physics degree could probably read a medical or biology paper and make some sense out of it, but they would never be as good at interpreting it as someone with medical or biology background. Someone with a biology degree would probably be lost trying to read a physics or astronomy paper. 

So to do good science journalism, you cannot just have a science journalist. You need to have a physics journalist and an astronomy journalist and a medical journalist and a chemistry journalist, et cetera. But most places won't even hire a general science journalist."
394,These days you only need to rewrite an article someone else wrote about the subject and slap a click bait tile on it.
395,"Definitely a yes on Science Friday. I am a scientist and I'm often really frustrated by science journalism 

(one among many examples i.e. diet coke causes cancer! When the real study was aspartame dosed at an EXTREMELY high level in mice that most people would never be exposed to, and likely never reach a threshold to cause cancer. Just one example, but a lot of people avoid aspartame because ""it causes cancer"")

Science Friday is a show that keeps me interested as a scientist but also appeals to a general audience. Its very difficult to walk that line when you're audience has a broad range."
396,and to do that withouth bias and not to lose too much in translation that makes people think they understand something when they don't - its truly a difficult thing to do and those that can should be admired

401,"I would argue that, in my field (curriculum studies AKA education), research NEEDS to be written for lay people to resolve what we refer to as the ""theory-practice gap.""  That is to say, we have a huge problem of teachers being years if not decades behind the latest and greatest in educational practice because the last time they got any sort of educational theory was in college (and even that was probably seriously diluted).  If we want teachers who may only have a bachelor's degree to use the latest and greatest out of educational research, then the research article itself has to be written for the lay teacher in mind."
402,"They question is then, do we want only the scientists and scientific journalists to know and understand the article to communicate to their peers OR do we want an average person to understand and communicate to their peers?

Personally that’s more depends on the subject matter to me."
403,"Many people in academic/scientific fields are self-important and come up with ""novel"" language as a way of creating a moat that establishes and protects their disciplinary ""supremacy."" So a significant amount of jargon is pointless beyond erecting protective silos for academic status strivers and tryhards."
404,"Yeah, that's the exact point they're making. Just because you're being precise, accurate, and careful doesn't make it automatically unreadable. You do realize that coherent, easily digested writing is a skill right? And that most researchers aren't interested or motivated to put the extra work required to polish their results so that they're easily digested.

Edit: seems like this is controversial.

Let's suppose there are two ways you can rate a paper: how technical it is, and how readable it is. 

Obviously, the more technical a paper is the harder it is to read.

Obviously, how readable a paper is determines how large the audience capable of reading it is, how quickly all readers of the paper can understand and digest its contents, and the less likely mistakes and misunderstandings are going to be hidden in the paper or taken by the reader.

Now the implication of the first goal is ""the less readable a paper is, the more technical it is"". Obviously, this is false, because you can make anything unreadable. 

Therefore, if a paper is unreadable, then you can't say that it's unreadable simply because it's technically complex. It could simply be because the author is a bad writer, and considering the demographics of the kind of people that write these papers, that seems very likely. Therefore, since there's ""extra unreadability"" that's not inherent to the subject matter, it should be possible to teach the author better ways of writing so that there's as few barriers to understanding the actually hard parts of the paper as possible.

I'm not advocating for papers to be written at a fifth grade level. That would be stupid. I'm instead saying that there's a cultural problem with academic writing, where the clarity of what's being said is not seen as important. To rectify this, I think that people should start talking about the problem, and people need to start paying attention to not only the content of papers but also how effectively that content is delivered. 

If papers as a whole became more readable, it's pretty unlikely that the average layman would find it easy to read them. However, for educated people, expanding the range of papers that can be read would be extremely useful. The kinds of people that would benefit from more readable papers include scientists in the same field as the paper, scientists outside the papers field, hobbyists, and proffessionals. Making papers more readable improves the understanding of everyone who reads the paper, including the intended audience of professional scientists well versed in the papers field."
405,"It's main audience may be people in the field, but there are also people new to the field that want to enter it. And more and more research requires mixed competences, so if you can attract a broader audience that should be a good thing. So whenever the conciseness is not strictly needed, it's good to avoid it in my opinion.

I replaced almost every single ""novel"" in my latest article with ""new"" because my colleague just had the habit of using ""novel"" when writing articles. Because it just sounded silly, and wasn't very concise either. I only left novel when talking about our own ""novel technique"" to highlight what was our contribution."
406,"I would argue *most* research papers are straight up poorly written, because many times there is clearly no intention whatsoever to explain the information in a reasonable fashion. 

They use needlessly technical terms when they *aren't* necessary. The papers are littered with pointlessly complex grammatical structure. Often times they use triple the amount of words necessary to explain certain subjects, while completely glossing over others, when in the context of the paper both should be equally prioritized.

Its just bad writing. They depend on the density and complexity to convince others that its not *bad*, rather, they're just too dumb to understand. 

But someone who actually understands what you're talking about can easily see where you had the opportunity to use better, more efficient phrasing, yet chose to go for heavy jargon instead to convince people you're more legit or whatever. 

The fact it actually works though is the sad part honestly."
407,"I can tell you for a fact that there is an incentive for researchers to write more terse, jargon-filled papers. The less easy it is to understand a paper, the more likely reviewers are to gloss over it and consider it strong. After all, if the math is so complex and involved that it'd take you, a seasoned researcher, days to parse it, it must be a good paper, right? Reviewers aren't paid to review, and they don't have a lot of time to devote to reviewing any given paper."
408,You left out the step where you spend days trying to get the word count down to the journal's requirements.
409,"Thanks for the elaboration. Sounds a lot like advice I've gotten to avoid the workplace fracturing into ""silo-thinking"" where the different educations each develop their own variant of a local ""language""."
410,"Yeah, but according to this article your approach is the problem. Even with definitions, the reader is disengaged."
411,"The caveat with this is how much new information can be handled before the reader 'exits' the conversation within the ""forest of detail"". Especially with lower attention spans, I think it's important to provide casual and subtle reinforcement of the definition(s) throughout the read, and provide context for the less familiar. I can think about git documentation as an example of how confusing it is."

425,"Yes, making the term more generally understandable - even at the loss of accuracy - is the point.

>For example, one of the sentences in the high-jargon version of the surgical robots paragraph read: “This system works because of AI integration through motion scaling and tremor reduction.”

&#x200B;

Many people, in the example of surgical robots, may not totally internalize the precision required in some fine surgeries. You're just cutting open someone and sewing them back up, why do you have to be that careful?

The term ""motion scaling"" in the example is probably the most insidious one - in my experience (as a college science instructor) students have a big issue with the idea of ""scaling"". I can't imagine the general public. It's a word that doesn't seem like jargon, but really is. They're thinking bathroom scale, not map scale."

434,Exactly; it's not a specialist's fault if some thicko doesn't understand long words & couldn't be bothered to go educate themselves. What they term jargon in this report are words used to explicitly reduce jargon by virtue of their specific meaning.

I disagree that this is always true."
441,"I’m a nurse and there is a huge push now for physician notes to be easily accessible to the patient online. It sounds great because it offers transparency, but it’s definitely caused some “note bloat” as doctors try to write for a larger audience. Patients can track their chart online, so some of them are sitting in their hospital bed on their phone and basically keeping up in real time. Then they call me in and ask me to translate. After discussing it they’ll say “why can’t he just write this in plain English so I can understand it?” Well, because the words mean specific things. “Gross drainage” isn’t going to cut it in the medical world. 

I think patients should have access to their records and the things that are being said about them for sure, but there needs to be a way for professionals to communicate as accurately as possible. I’d be happy If there was a way to “lock” notes until discussed with a doctor or nurse perhaps? And there still needs to be a “sensitive note” option for scenarios like suspected abuse where we don’t want the caregiver to potentially have access until the appropriate people can be be called in.  

Professional publications need to look at the target audience first and foremost. Others shouldn’t be discouraged from accessing the information, but need to keep in mind when they are or aren’t the target audience."
442,">And just because someone is intelligent doesn’t mean that reading comprehension is their strong suit.

I've found that can often be true when it comes to people who might be very good at mathematics / computer programing / algorithmic thinking.

One of the best technical writers I know comes from a humble working class background. Why I don't know perhaps they weren't brought-up to use pompous language or had to communicate their work with family members who weren't well educated...

That said, do you want to have to explain that everytime you reference it to another educator? Or is simply saying theory-practice gap easier?"
456,"I think your argument is perfectly sound. However, education is a rather special case when it comes to academic research. Jargon allows a number of complex concepts to be discussed in a single packet, which is rather crucial for efficiently communicating at the frontiers of a technical field.

I do think the typical academic work could use a pass or two at de-jargoning, but it should only be applied where it can be gotten away with."

458,"At a guess is say that there's a term for predicted grades, or the poorer kids etc that lay people won't know?

My housemate for example is a teacher and drops the odd term. SEN for example, so a lot of lay people isn't necessarily known, but is perfectly understandable to those in the industry.

The theory practice gap absolutely applies, and is important to bridge, but there's also a theory-lay person gap which is even bigger.

Within research contexts I'd absolutely say being concise and using correct terminology to prevent confusion is more important than bridging that gap."
459,I find it interesting that you use jargon (theory-practice gap) and have to contextualize it before carrying on. It would be exhausting to do this constantly. For writer and reader.
460,Depends on the field. I refuse to believe that there's any significant amount of people outside the field reading catalytic electrochemistry papers.
461,"Personally I prefer short and extremely dense articles with easy to digest abstract and conclusion. Then you get it both ways. A 40 page paper takes too long to read when you have a 100 papers to read. And when I write a paper I prefer short and concise. I absolutely only write to my peers. But the abstract, posters, perhaps figures, and 50% of the discussion/introduction I try to make more general. Even then papers tend to be over 20 pages long. But yes, it's important to communicate out from the ivory tower but time and money. Too little of either."
462,"Within-field academic writing should be short and to the point even if it includes jargon. Scientists have to read and digest an insane amount of material to keep up in their field, and when you know the material it's much easier and quicker to read the jargon.

For example, I unfortunately read many papers adjacent to my field (math) which are written by people slightly outside my field (CS). Mathematical writing becomes long, clunky, and cumbersome when it includes all computational steps without omitting obvious ones, and when it and avoids using words like ""functor"" and ""colimit"" except as an aside. Most of the 40 page papers I've read shortened into digestible 3-5 pages of mathematics that would have taken me significantly less time to read and communicated the point more clearly to people in the field."
463,Why would you not want the average person to understand the article?
464,"I agree, but there are definitely niche scientific fields that rely on jargon for concision. There’s also the argument that the vocabulary used in niche fields is ubiquitous in their individual communities, so any reader will likely already be familiar with the jargon. This isn’t always the case, though."
465,I think he means that if every research paper had to explain everything in plain English it would get a crazy amount bigger. Like behind a lot of the jargon are some very complex ideas and theories that could take a paper themselves to explain in plain English.
466,"I just joined the field of catalytic electrochemistry, and have to look up stuff very often. I look through some of the articles and don't see how the articles could be written without jargon, without seeming almost ironically dumbed down. And I don't see why they would remove the jargon, because the only time someone without at least a bachelors degree in the field would read the papers, is when the university PR department want to overhype a new release."
467,"In many scientific fields, the concepts being talked about, the prior research being treated as a given and known to the audience, is so vast and so complex that it is just not feasible to make it readable to a lay audience. You don't just go and make a physics paper ""easily digestable"". It's full of math! You don't just ""put in extra work"" to make a genetics paper easily digested. It's just not feasible and not necessary.

These papers are so specific, if you broke them down in simple language, they would stop being useful to scientists who speak the language of science. At least in the hard sciences, being understandable to laymen is not a desireable goal."
468,"Yes, that is where scientific journalism comes in, to translate the study for the lay person.

490,"It _is_ necessary, though. The medical field uses latin because you can describe _exactly_ where and what an injury is with just two or three complicated words.

When you replace one or two _sentences_ with a couple words, it makes catching someone else up _a lot_ faster, notes shorter, diagnosis far more difficult to misconstrue when it's an exact term instead of a loose description, etc, etc. It also helps a lot when working in other countries. Instead of a doctor going, ""crap, I don't know the French word for infection, how do I say this...""

Unified terms also make international R&D infinitely easier for similar reasons.

Latin/Greek in the medical field does make sense. Though journalists are still fully capable of overusing the terms, of course. Though that's a question of a journalist's ability to write about complicated topics for a target audience. If they can't at least explain the terms in an article meant for plebs, maybe they shouldn't be writing on the topic for plebs..."
491,"I personally love the greek roots used in medicine--once you learn the ""code,"" its really easy to describe symptoms or novel discoveries. 

For example, once you learn that ""brady"" means slow, then you can deduce that ""bradykinin"" does something slow, ""bradycardia"" has to do with a slow heart (slow heartbeat in this case), and ""bradypnea"" has something to do with ""slow lungs"""

That last bit has a lot to do with ‘changing jargon for an audience’ while still remaining true to the actual meaning and specificity of terms.

At the end of the day, if seeing scientific jargon puts you off of science, you really aren’t meant for science. If one is truly curious jargon is easy to understand after background. Up until college level really standardized testing of ‘science’ melts down to basic reading comprehension."
494,"What you're describing is science journalism, like National Geographic. It's totally a thing and has been a thing for ages, which is good.

The only problem, highlighted by the article, is when NatGeo in some effort to be more scientific, forgets who their audience is and packs it's pages with jargon such that readers are turned away and care less in general about science as a result (the opposite of their goal). 

You're absolutely right, both types of work need to exist, one for the professional scientific community and one for the lay community. This study is simply a critique of certain possible methods of disseminating the scientific information to the latter effectively."
495,You mean like research papers versus reports about research papers?
496,"There usually is. There's the original journal article, and then if it's picked up by a pop science website the version intended for the general public. My preference is to read the original journal when possible because I find pop science journalists can at times skew the original meanings the researchers presented. However, pop science reporting of journal articles is important for the proliferation of new research into more of a general, uninformed audience. This study seems specifically aimed at science journalism, or pop science writers. Something I think a lot of people missed because, surprising to no one, most only read the title."

I would call law and theory on the same step or perhaps on two completely different sets of stairs. Since a law is something we know happens and we can make an equation that describes it(gravity for example), but we don't know why that something happens. That's where a theory comes in. To use gravity again as an example, Issac Newton made a law of gravity. He made an equation to explain it. But a theory of gravity would be developed much later as the result of research by Einstein and other scientists that tried to explain why gravity exists and how it works."

502,"A law of nature is a different class of thing than a theory. A law of nature is an observation. An observation that always holds true, but still an observation. Laws are things like: stuff falls, heat moves from hot to cold, gasses expand when you heat them.  

A theory tells us why something happens. Curvature of space-time, hot molecules bounce harder off the walls.  Theories take all of the relevant observations and weave them into a story that explains why the things we saw happened. 

If I see something happen once (a better joke in the comments), it isn't a law of nature. If I see the same thing every time across multiple scenarios (the real joke is always in the comments) it starts to gain acceptance as a law. I can now use that law to support (or invalidate) other ideas, because it is accepted that it will always happen. 

I have a hypothesis (an unsupported explaination) that better comedians don't submit, but only comment. There is a competing hypothesis that commenters have the ability to improve on the OP because they have a chance to respond to feedback in the comments.

I can make observations to test my hypothesis, (looking to see if ""real joke"" commenters ever submit jokes) if I find examples where my hypothesis doesn't work, I refine it, or outright reject it.  Eventually, with enough evidence the community will accept one of the explanations. At some point we start calling it the theory of the real joke, because it accurately (to the best of current evidence) explains why this law always holds true."

504,"I've seen a similar thing in my field (infosec) but for a different reason. Most of the time they use the jargon because they don't understand the issue and not necessarily to hide that lack of knowledge. 

An over simplistic example: new analyst sees a threat in a tool related to SMTP communication. They contact the user and ask ""hey, I noticed an application using SMTP is being blocked by our firewall from your computer. Any idea what might cause that?"" Of course, user has no idea what that is. The analyst doesn't know that SMTP is simply email. They could have asked the user (had they known) ""hey, is your email acting funny? We noticed something being blocked from your computer.""

507,"It's far more common for an entity that wishes to see a specific kind of result out of a research paper to simply find a scientist with strong personal bias than pay them off, cheaper and has more plausible deniability. This is why it's always a good idea to be aware of a scientist's background and factor that into perception of their work. Even just as a matter of time dedication. Someone who has literally spent their entire lives studying, trying to understand and possibly even teaching others about a given theory or model are not going to be eager to disprove it and will not uncommonly go to rather comical lengths to deny any attempt to do so. The Great Debate in astronomy and astrophysics is a fantastic example of this. 

That said there are also matters of maintaining access to research resources to keep in mind as well. Whether or not someone is directly told to come to a certain conclusion there may be pressure to do so out of fear that they will lose access to critical resources for further research. Most research scientists operate on very minimal budgets and every penny counts, losing access to what little funding they have can be disastrous."

That's just within one undergraduate degree. Now consider that scientists have worked within their field through at least their master's and are primarily concerned with figuring out what is true and disseminating that information efficiently to others who will make use of that information, as well as absorbing new information efficiently. They're not going to go back and review chemical formulas or even the distinction between Ab initio and Newtonian molecular dynamics simulations (that would be mentioned and left as a reference). Communication would grind to a halt otherwise."
512,"It depends on context. Sometimes ""jargon"" will contain levels of nuance relevant to the paper.

514,"> almost ironically dumbed down

Did you mean 'almost comically'? :)

In any case, I agree, the point of 'jargon' is that you can carry a whole paragraph of meaning (or even way more) in a single word. This is bad for people not in the field, but that's not who research papers are aimed at - it is however very good for efficient communication between people in the field.

Sometimes, there is a tendency to make sentences sound more complicated than they need to be, I have noticed that before - it makes your argument sound more learned e.g. in a paper. In my opinion, that's a bad thing - but most of the 'jargon' discussed by OP's article is not unnecessary complication, it's just technical terms without which science can't really function."
515,"> At least in the hard sciences, being understandable to laymen is not a desireable goal.

Neither is it in the not-so-hard sciences. *Every* science relies on using a set of defined terms that each would take quite a while to explain to a layperson, if they could even understand it by itself without first having to learn a whole host of other terms.

Science just can't be simplified and still be useful for scientists in the same field. It can be simplified so it's more understandable to laypeople, which is of course perfectly fine, or rather, definitely necessary, but that's not how state-of-the-art or cutting-edge research is conducted."

519,"A silo is any situation in which information is stored within a specific subgroup/sublocation as opposed to being stored in a location that is shared by the entire group. Putting information in silos limits the accessibility of the information, and severely limits how easily that information can be integrated with information that's held in a different silo."

531,"Good scientific articles (those that could equally be explained verbally) focuses more on what we know about a process through causation than on simply describing the different components (of which there'll be many to memorize) and observations. I refer to papers describing causation in a process as knowledge papers and the other as observational papers that basically describe the data.

Knowledge papers provide insight into the process rather than just describing different categories of events/data typified in observational papers. An observational paper will typically have a lot of technical jargon. It makes sense that such papers are hard to read, since the gist of the paper is clouded by terms instead of a description of the causative process.

The vast majority of scientific papers are observational papers, mostly because it's much easier to write and publish given publish or perish academic environment. Knowledge papers are extremely difficult to write since everything you write must be falsifiable and evidenced. The same does not hold for observational papers (just needs some evidence interpreted using some peer-accepted approach)."
532,"But again, the amount of extra information that is needed to explain it requires a whole paragraph.

""Topological insulating chalcogenides and the effect of strain"" would literally require you to tell people:

What topological insulators are, what the family of compounds are that are chalcogenides, what strain is defined by in this paper, and then what the applications are (which typically are complicated in their own right).

Name almost any solid state exotic phenomenon, without including even compounds yet, and try to explain it and it's applications to a layman. Superconductivity is arguably the easiest, yet even it is extremely complex, and summerizing the phenomena doesn't do it justice as many applications are due to the consequences of ~ 0 resistance rather than the 0 resistance itself. For example you can't explain superconductivities applications in NMRI's without also explaining how moving charges create a magnetic field, which begins to open up more cans of worms."
533,Not true in math and physics. You'd need to do a lot of explaining to get around the technical terms. It's not gatekeeping and more just a communication short cut.
534,"In the context of science, I have no idea what I would be doing without jargon. 

Remember that post a little bit ago about the woman on the plane who reported a guy for ""writing in a foreign script"", when it turned out he was doing math? 

That's kind of what it feels like. A lot of specific terms/symbols are immediately understandable to experts because they spent weeks learning about them in school/being exposed to it during training.

Not to say there's absolutely zero gatekeeping, but in the sciences a lot of the jargon conveys highly abstract concepts that do legitimately take weeks to explain in plain English"
535,"Would you provide some examples? I'm interested.

All jargon I've encountered so far has been out of necessity/tradition. You could (even when communicating with non-layman) use common words to convey the same meaning, but that takes time and time is often a luxury. Obviously, when I explain something technical to a non-layman I always try to keep it simple and make sure they understand before proceeding. Sometimes that means going on tangents, because they lack the background knowledge.

(The recent Coronavirus has been worrying many of my friends, so I'm referencing recent conversations.)"
536,"I got my BA in physics and business and I felt that the jargon used in text for science was necessary however there’s a huge need for translations into more layman’s terms. But people who speak using all of the correct jargon are usually gatekeeping.  
On the other hand a lot of the jargon used in my business courses felt a lot like gatekeeping.  Especially when people start having conversations to others who are not studying business."
537,"Yea, definitely not true for programming.

I've had conversations with co-workers during which I've passively realized that almost every active word is some jargon that would mean nothing (or the wrong thing) to someone outside the field.  But most of those things have specific meanings that are otherwise difficult to describe."
538,"From my own experience, legal jargon is definitely a mixed bag. Sometimes lawyers use specific words and phrases because they need precision and reliability; but other times it's because lawyers get a kick out of being impossible to understand. 

The garbled sentence ""Said plaintiff did then bring suit against said defendant for said amounts, aforesaid, under the terms of the written instrument, and for any other relief as the court may, in its determination, find said plaintiff to be entitledto."" could just as easily be ""Plaintiff sued Defendant for the amount owed under the contract and for any other relief to which he may be entitled."" It loses almost no meaning in the law or in layperson's terms. 

The sentence on Louisiana property law ""Donations inter vivos of incorporeals and immovables are absolutely null unless made by authentic act."" can be explained ""Gifts of things you can't touch (like bank accounts or ownership shares of a business) or big things like land or buildings must be made  in writing and must be notarized.""

540,"From what I've heard, they are the exact same thing, law is just now an obsolete term. Before 20th century people still feel that they are searching for the pillars of universes so they call what they find 'law'.

Observe, none of the physics laws are from after 19th century, they all come before."

1. Immediately and easily identify the academic in-group related to that jargon 

2. Intellectual masturbation

I say this as someone with background in social science, disciplines famous for making the simple into the needlessly complex through the use of arcane language (to it's own detriment).

I don't need to know what enzymes are, or that its a reaction between amino acids, nor do I need to understand 90% of what it is or how it works. I just need to know that some foods brown with heat and that it makes it taste different. Then when you understand the basics, you delve deeper if you want to learn the more nitty gritty of things.

They're really a remarkably simple device. 

To someone who knows nothing about supersonic flow theory, the amount of background that has to be laid out to get to that one sentence *and still have it make any sense at all* is significant.

Scientist aren't using jargon just because they want to alienate people or make things needlessly complicated. It's because it takes A LOT of extra effort to get away with NOT using it while still effectively communicating what you're trying to say. There's a reason journalists create summaries for less technically focused audiences and it's not because the scientists are gatekeeping.

But without the framework, they may have to write thousands of additional lines of code.  They must basically write their own framework.

All humans learning jargon must at least partially implement their own framework. Even if they read explanations, there is some internal translation going on to get the idea cogent in their minds.  This is probably why it kills people's interest: it's hard to do."
565,"I run into this problem ALL the time in my research. I can easily describe the research briefly, but then they'll usually ask ""what can we do with this?""

You can just say, ""your phone beams your signal up to the satellite, and the satellite knows where you are and can tell you where to go."" It's a very simplistic explanation but it gets the basic idea of what's going on across to a very young mind who won't likely understand it very well yet.

Most research is focused on studying interesting phenomena, discovering new physics, finding a deeper understanding of nature, and possible applications might just not be forseeable yet and if so, it might be a rather vague idea. The scientific progress itself will be ""hard locked"" behind a basic understanding of solid state physics. You can deliver that to someone that has an undergrad in physics without much hazzle, but in any other case you'll finding yourself explaining at least basics from quantum mechanics and electrodynamics as well. 

Analogies or descriptions like ""food gets brown with heat and tasty"" are

a) not always possible (inherently)   
b) extremely hard to find  
c) always inaccurate to some extent. 

It's immensely challenging and unfortunately just not that much of a priority for researchers, as there is little incentive to do so.

^(I'm not really satisfied with my answer here, but I'm not sure what I can still add. I just hope this was helpful.)"
579,"Okay, but why do only certain foods brown with heat and taste different?

The more interesting topics require you to have more than just basic knowledge, it isn't gatekeeping at all"
580,"Yep. It is all about levels of abstraction.

An electrical engineer doesn't need to know quantum theory to use a resistor, but it might help him design a better resistor."
581,But the paper is probably only important to other solid state physicists any way.   Very few individual papers have direct import or applicability to the lay public.
582,"Solid state physics does get things out of lab, in a rate much higher than, say string theory people?"
583,"Yes, sorry, lovely little brain fart there.

Malapropism, if we want to use the jargon term!"
584,"Sure, and if your context is ""experts communicating with informed people"", that's great. Perhaps even necessary. If I was listening to a lecture in one of my content areas and the speaker sounded like an IFL Science article, I would probably tune out.

The context I was speaking from was ""experts communicating with outsiders""

If I say ""Structural Functionalism"" to a person who's never studied sociology, I am inviting misunderstanding. If you are attempting to convey a very specific meaning, and the jargon actually creates confusion, what have you accomplished?

Edits"
585,"ugh, that is definitely not what i'm saying, and I'm sorry I've offended you. No need for the hostility.

The point is to know your audience. I figured that was clear in my very first sentence. I really don't think that is a contentious idea."
586,"That's not something you'll go into if you're describing how to cook a steak. That's what science writing for a general audience is. You're not teaching them the entire field but trying to succinctly describe the results of one experiment or one hyper-focused subject. 

If they are interested you will give them the tools to start researching more. And finding out what food brown and which don't metaphorically."
587,"Clearly you've never watched a cooking show where they say everything in normalized terms. ""Because fats break down causing different flavors. Less fat, less flavor change & browning"""
588,"That's kind of the point. The paper itself doesn't need to be written for the layman; an article about the paper does. The only reason to write an article to a lay audience about it is if it is important to a lay audience. And that article shouldn't generally bother itself trying to explain what topological insulating chalcogenides are. Probably not even mention those kinds of terms at all if the audience is general enough.

Important ideas need to be distilled into three general formats. A technical paper fit for a journal with peers in mind; a less technical article for those with a strong interest and/or background in science/technology, but maybe not in the specific subject; a very simplistic article for a general audience.

Filling the general article with jargon helps no one. Only the journal paper needs it. Explanations of some terms can be given in the science article, but only the most important terms if they're really necessary to understanding the importance of the original paper."
589,"Those people are precisely not who this discussion is about, though"
590,Has string theory even gone in to a lab yet??
591,"Well we do have graphene, a miracle material, that can do everything except get out of the lab... But I get your point and grant it. It does."
592,"I totally agree. You have to adjust your language when talking to lay people. Saying ""These spines are a plastic trait"" would get people really confused. However, some people appear to think that jargon is entirely useful."
593,"Considering the fact that the upthread comment was:  

> Across a population, yes. However, the median person is not reading primary and review research literature.

Which would seem to ground the conversation in the role of jargon in research literature (which would be domain-specific conversations). This, when coupled with your seemingly generalized statement that jargon's primary purpose is gatekeeping and mental masturbation, certainly seems to send a message that jargon shouldn't be used anywhere (even in research articles and among people in the field).

Put differently, your position seemed to be ""jargon is bad"", instead of ""jargon is hard to understand by outsiders – we should ensure that we write to the audience, and have plenty of gateway articles to provide good bridges to help draw people in.""

I suspect that the ""jargon is bad"" inference touched a nerve in the current seemingly anti-science/anti-knowledge/anti-truth climate."
594,"""Dingoes are wild canids living in Australia, originating from domestic dogs. They have lived isolated from both the wild and the domestic ancestor, making them a unique model for studying feralization. Here, we sequence the genomes of 10 dingoes and 2 New Guinea Singing Dogs. Phylogenetic and demographic analyses show that dingoes originate from dogs in southern East Asia, which migrated via Island Southeast Asia to reach Australia around 8300 years ago, and subsequently diverged into a genetically distinct population. Selection analysis identifies 50 positively selected genes enriched in digestion and metabolism, indicating a diet change during feralization of dingoes. Thirteen of these genes have shifted allele frequencies compared to dogs but not compared to wolves. Functional assays show that an A-to-G mutation in ARHGEF7 decreases the endogenous expression, suggesting behavioral adaptations related to the transitions in environment. Our results indicate that the feralization of the dingo induced positive selection on genomic regions correlated to neurodevelopment, metabolism and reproduction, in adaptation to a wild environment."""
595,I always think of baby when I hear the word dingo for some reason.
596,Is there a point where a species goes from being feral to being considered wild again?
597,A scientist in Russia domesticated foxes in about 3-4 generations so I imagine the reverse could be true.
598,"As domestication is a relatively new phenomenon, I don't think there has been a point at which a feral population of ancestrally domestic animals have progressed to being considered fully wild animals in scientific circles. Domestication syndrome is long-lasting and even in the dingo we see differences between it and other wild canids.  

If there is introgression between wild and domestic conspecifics (e.g. feral pig and wild boar), I think the inclination is to consider it less of a feral ""domestic"" population and more part a population of the wild species."
599,"These foxes are tame, but do not have the same social characteristics that dogs do. Those take a lot longer to evolve."
600,"So if I have to try and summarise your post;

You don't know?"
601,"[Mans New Best Friend](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/mans-new-best-friend-a-forgotten-russian-experiment-in-fox-domestication/)
>The domesticated foxes were more eager to hang out with humans, whimpered to attract attention, and sniffed and licked their caretakers. They wagged their tails when they were happy or excited. (Does that sound at all like your pet dog?) Further, their fear response to new people or objects was reduced, and they were more eager to explore new situations. Many of the domesticated foxes had floppy ears, short or curly tails, extended reproductive seasons, changes in fur coloration, and changes in the shape of their skulls, jaws, and teeth. They also lost their ""musky fox smell.""


The experiment ran about 60 years and the foxes' descendants are now classified as domesticated. A much shorter experiment ran from 1996-1999 and at the end of it some of the foxes were sold as pets. Similar time frames have been seen with breeding wild cats as well to where it is about F5 or 5 generations from feral to be considered safe as a pet. 

>Is there a point where a species goes from being feral to being considered wild again?

Technically never as wild means never domesticated. However, the Mustangs of the Americas are considered wild by many and they became feral after escaping the Conquistadors in the 1500s."
602,"Actually there are no horses in the world considered wild. There were some, in Mongolia I believe, that were long considered wild but genetic testing showed that they had been domesticated and bred to their distinctive pattern and then released or escaped thousands of years ago and thus they too are now considered feral.

Horses released a couple of 100 years ago would definitely be considered feral then."

613,How many of these vape bros were smokers in the past though? Seems dubious to say these changes were caused by vaping when they likely used to smoke.
614,"I don’t vape or smoke, but I wonder if people who live in heavily polluted areas such as Chinese cities have the same similar changes in their DNA. Equating it to heavy air toxicity might have an effect on the general public’s benign opinion of it. Not that equating it to smoking shouldn’t already have that effect."

616,Quit 120 days ago today and couldn't be happier.
617,So does anyone know if these changes reverse when people quit?
618,"Biologically important changes in DNA seen in smokers are also being found in people who vape, according to a new study published in the journal Epigenetics.

A team of scientists at the Keck School of Medicine of USC have found people who vape exhibit similar chemical modifications in their overall genome and in parts of their DNA as people who smoke cigarettes.

These specific chemical alterations, also known as epigenetic changes, can cause genes to malfunction -- and are commonly found in nearly all types of human cancer as well as other serious diseases.

The findings add to a growing list of health concerns associated with vaping, which is perceived by many as a safer alternative to smoking. E-cigarette use has soared among youth, with more than 25 percent of high school students now using the products, according to the CDC.

The new study, led by Ahmad Besaratinia, PhD, associate professor at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, examined a group of people matched for age, gender and race, divided equally into three categories: vapers only, smokers only and a control group of people who neither vaped nor smoked.

Blood was drawn from each of the participants and tested for changes in levels of two specific chemical tags attached to DNA that are known to impact gene activity and/or function. These chemical tags include: (1) methyl groups in a specific DNA sequence, named Long Interspersed Nucleotide Element 1 (LINE-1); and (2) hydroxymethyl groups in the genome overall. Changes in the levels of these chemical tags, which are important for genomic stability and regulation of gene expression, occur in various stages of development, as well as in diseases such as cancer.

I think ""nicotine"" not being mentioned once in the article makes it concerning. It's pretty much the only ingredient they share, aside from maybe menthol.

And would vapers be more likely to get second hand smoke, or like you said, have smoked in the past?"
630,Is it nicotine or the ingestion method causing these mods
631,"Also, what type of ""e-cig"" did they use? Was it a mod/vape or like a Juul etc?"

i rarely trust these vape studies these days.  Though obviously Nicotine is Nicotine no matter the form you intake it. Vaping is a thousand chemicals fewer than cigarettes no matter how you look at it (literally burning plant material...), and doesnt have the crazy amount of Tar associated with smoking of any kind.  I quit a 20 year cigarette habit that was costing me hundreds of dollars every month,  by switching to basic Tank vape and juices, now costing me $20 a month.  So my lungs dont get tar, i dont inhale thousands of other chemicals, and it cost me a tenth of the price....

&#x200B;

but the people trying to take down vaping dont care about anything but the big tobacco kickbacks, so good luck people"
633,They were all screened and the likeliness is low.
634,There was just something in r/Science the other day that said there is an effect. I can’t remember the city
635,"Doesn't sound like it has anything to do with the device/temp/liquid/brand. The only chemical they would share is nicotine.

The title should say nicotine leaves biomarkers regardless of method of intake."
636,"Similarly, it doesn't express any quantitative data either. For all we know, the study could actually reinforce the message that vaping is safer (not safe) after all."
637,"If found, could you share ?"
638,"So since the only real overlapping ingredient vapes and cigarettes share is nicotine, this just puts the previously inconclusive ""is nicotine a carcinogen"" question back under the spotlight?"
639,"Also you probably smell a lot better. 

Because smoking impairs your sense of smell. 

Also it stinks. A lot."
640,[deleted]
641,Great question. I think they specifically mention when it's thc/cbd mods because the transmission is often very different between the two
642,They have nothing to gain from this considering they have invested a lot into vaping to try and offset declining cigarette profits.
643,They're all nicotine products
644,But what you don’t know is how painful a heart attack is. Then you’ll wish you hadn’t done it.
645,"Nobody thinks vaping is safe, it's just very likely that when properly utilized that it's substantially less harmful than smoking, which would still be very difficult statement to make untrue without vaping arsenic and uranium."
646,"This isnt a legit study. There is no information detailing the process. The things it claims arent founded on any real data being shown. The control groups and parameters are unknown. You're just an idiot because ""legit study"" equates to ""study I agree with"" for you."
647,The problem is that we can't know from this study because we don't know if the participants are ex smokers or not.
648,Yea I wouldn't be surprised if the tiny things from tobacco companies actually used the whole alkaloid or whatever which would include MAOIs.
649,"Congrats!  I’m just over a year without a regular cigarette habit (had 2 drunk smokes in 2019, both disgusted me) and I’m down to 15mg juice. I smoked for 24 years and I’ve not felt this good in a long time.  I don’t think I would have ever quit cigarettes with vaping as an option, and now I can see a future without nicotine entirely. While I’m still addicted, I find that nic salt addiction is much different than cigarette nicotine addiction. Like I used to get squirrely on long flights or when I wasn’t able to smoke once an hour. Now I can go a full day without and barely notice"
650,It does not sound like it. Most vapers are ex smokers. So the Biomakers of someone that smoked never go away. That and could there be a decrease in biomakers??
651,Or maybe  the people that vape had a past of smoking? That the only real link. Or where all of the people test where never smokers but vapers?
652,"It wasn’t really ever out of the spotlight. However considering there’s no mention of a control for people who used to solely smoke but switched to solely vaping and n=45 I’d consider this a trash paper. More, and better designed, studies are needed."
653,What's your point?
654,Just because they have a stake in vaping doesn't mean they aren't losing money over declining cigarette sales
655,Yes but form and absorption and such matter.
656,That wil only last a little bit though and with some luck you won't feel a thing anymore haha
657,"Considering the results,why not do another ?"
658,Take that juice lower! You'll do fine at 12 and then bump it to six. I'm at a 3 consistently!
659,margins are higher on vape products since they don't contain tobacco.
660,"I'd agree but according to the study they already crossed cigarettes and vapes, eliminating thousands of chemicals and leaving only nicotine."
661,"That’s exactly what I thought! However, the pain is quite severe. It feels like you are getting stabbed. In certain cases it goes away if you sit down then comes back if you walk a block. Your first inclination is to make it stop (this I must emphasize), not wait a while and hope it gets so bad that you die. So you go to a doctor and end up with some sort of cure. Now you’re right back where you started except with some sort of large deductible you have to pay off. It’s fifteen years later and now you have a family. 

Anyway it’s the most expensive painful way to go. And you never know when or if it’s going to happen. I don’t recommend it."

First, the original study that collected the occasional users had a battery of cognitive functioning tests and this study did not mention that and did not mention the a similar battery of tests (but did say similar methods were used). If they collected all this information, why wasn't it mentioned? If they didn't, why not? I would think exploring functional differences alongside the brain scan comparisons would be of interest. Makes me think that there werent many functional differences between groups. Further, it introduces the potential that the researchers may have been selective with which data they included. 

Second, limitations weren't really discussed towards the (what I interpret as) the low power non-parametric t-test combined with the small group sizes and cross sectional between subjects design.

830,"Study (open access): [Early Last Interglacial ocean warming drove substantial ice mass loss from Antarctica](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/10/1902469117)
____

>**Significance**

>Fifty years ago, it was speculated that the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet is vulnerable to warming and may have melted in the past. Testing this hypothesis has proved challenging due to the difficulty of developing in situ records of ice sheet and environmental change spanning warm periods. We present a multiproxy record that implies loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet during the Last Interglacial (129,000 to 116,000 y ago), associated with ocean warming and the release of greenhouse gas methane from marine sediments. Our ice sheet modeling predicts that Antarctica may have contributed several meters to global sea level at this time, suggesting that this ice sheet lies close to a “tipping point” under projected warming.

>**Abstract**

>The future response of the Antarctic ice sheet to rising temperatures remains highly uncertain. A useful period for assessing the sensitivity of Antarctica to warming is the Last Interglacial (LIG) (129 to 116 ky), which experienced warmer polar temperatures and higher global mean sea level (GMSL) (+6 to 9 m) relative to present day. LIG sea level cannot be fully explained by Greenland Ice Sheet melt (∼2 m), ocean thermal expansion, and melting mountain glaciers (∼1 m), suggesting substantial Antarctic mass loss was initiated by warming of Southern Ocean waters, resulting from a weakening Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in response to North Atlantic surface freshening. Here, we report a blue-ice record of ice sheet and environmental change from the Weddell Sea Embayment at the periphery of the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), which is underlain by major methane hydrate reserves. Constrained by a widespread volcanic horizon and supported by ancient microbial DNA analyses, we provide evidence for substantial mass loss across the Weddell Sea Embayment during the LIG, most likely driven by ocean warming and associated with destabilization of subglacial hydrates. Ice sheet modeling supports this interpretation and suggests that millennial-scale warming of the Southern Ocean could have triggered a multimeter rise in global sea levels. Our data indicate that Antarctica is highly vulnerable to projected increases in ocean temperatures and may drive ice–climate feedbacks that further amplify warming."

If 'something' caused the ice caps to FORM (i.e., 'cooling'), why do people get so worried that 'something' is causing them to melt? Do people not realize there are daily, yearly, period etc cycles? Why do people worry about this? Its simply not realistic to worry about it. If it's 'man-made', you have to get rid of the man or the made, and western civilization is making huge strides to combat both.

We have observed that it's causing less energy to radiate out than what is radiated in, and that difference is explained by the CO2+H2O that we added to the atmosphere. Energy in minus energy out equals increase in thermal energy. This is obvious enough that natural cycles are about as likely as a cause for the temperature rise, as they were in my car after I turned on the AC this morning."

I'd say it's a perfectly applied term for what you and I both are envisioning the concept of ""expanding your mind"" as.. at least imo :)

2.
lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder.


Neither of these are exciting things to do to my mind.  Adding randomness, gradual decline or disorder is not usually something a human seeks for their mind.   You can shake your measuring stick at the various definitions attributed to 'entropy', but I still contend that it is a poor choice.

(I liked the article)"
868,"It is called brain entropy because there is an increase in irregular variability of brain activity, making the way the brain communicates with itself more chaotic. Scientists aren't trying to market this to consumers when they choose the term entropy, they're trying to accurately describe what they observe. 

There's really not a good way to define ""expanding the mind"" in a meaningful manner as far as we can measure, but since we can look at the physical connectivity and functional networking of the brain it has meaning to say the brain becomes more entropic in certain conditions, e.g. meditation and psychedelics"

882,"It does.

A pseudorandom process by definition is a process that produces a predictable outcome given the required information where in absence of said information a sequence of numbers generated by said process exhibits statistical randomness.

A true random number by definition is a number selected from a range with equal chance of all numbers being selected via an unpredictable method.

Unlike any manmade algorithm that produces pseudorandom numbers, a chaotic complex system like this has completely unpredictable behaviour. No amount of information would ever allow you to predict the outcome."

If something is deterministic, as you yourself said that this is, then that means it isn't truly random. If something can be predicted given perfect information on the relevant variables, it isn't truly random. It might not be feasible in practice, but neither is *truly* predicting *anything* given that we cannot possibly account for every single variable in practice. We also can't measure anything with perfect accuracy, we can only approximate reality to a precision of X decimals. 

That means we can only ever make approximate predictions, but that doesn't mean that the exact flight path of a thrown ball is truly random, since it is still deterministic."

888,"A growing health crisis fueled by synthetic chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in groundwater has garnered much attention in the last few years.

The reported levels could be ""just the tip of the iceberg,"" as most of the chemicals are still migrating down slowly through the soil, according to Bo Guo, University of Arizona assistant professor of hydrology and atmospheric sciences.

Nearly 3,000 synthetic chemicals belong to the PFAS class. They have been used since the 1940s in food packaging, water-resistant fabrics, non-stick products, pizza boxes, paints, firefighting foams and more, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The chemicals don't break down in the environment or in the body, and a growing number of research papers have shown that PFAS contamination in water sources is widespread in the United States and that exposure is harmful to health.

""Because PFAS are in a lot of consumer and industrial products, they can get into wastewater. Treatment plants are not designed to treat these compounds, so these chemicals just stay in that water to get reused. It's sprayed on soccer fields or used to recharge aquifers, for example,"" said Mark Brusseau, professor of environmental science. ""PFAS can also get into the biosolids, which are land-applied as fertilizer, so there are all these sources, which means they could have entered the environment at many different time periods and repeatedly.""

To understand how the chemicals migrate through the soil between the land surface and groundwater – an area called the vadose zone – University of Arizona researchers developed a novel mathematical model to simulate the different complex processes that affect the transport and retention of these chemicals.

904,"Sorry but I am definitely more worried about poisons in our water rather than the climate changing. The climate has been changing for literally billions of years, non-stop. The water being poisoned is not natural and a much bigger immediate danger."

908,I've heard before that increased height also means an increased risk for heart trouble later in life. The heart must work harder to provide blood to a larger body. So you may stave off dementia at a cost to your heart.
909,and how does it height have anything to do with dementia?
910,This study investigated men only.
911,">The Table furthermore shows that the mean height was greater among men with *higher intelligence level, higher level of education, younger birth cohorts*, and those living in the Capital region. Similarly, these groups also experiences fewer cases of dementia.

Probably

1. Education and money possibly lack of malnutrition.

2. Lifestyle"
912,"“Body height, a biomarker that reflects the interplay of genetic endowment and early-life experiences and exposures (e.g., nutrition, social and psychological circumstances), may provide insights into the aetiology of a wide range of disease outcomes. In the current study, the authors explore the association between body height and dementia. They use Danish national registers to obtain data from the conscript board, including height, intelligence, and educational attainment, matched with data from health registers to identify those with dementia diagnoses or who were taking medication typically prescribed for Alzheimer's disease. Their results showed that taller body height was associated with significantly lower rate of dementia after adjusting for a series of confounders. In addition, they attempted to distinguish this protective effect of body height from confounding by genetics – a strong determinant of height – through analysis of within siblings and within twin differences. This study represents a potentially valuable contribution to the literature on early life risk factors for dementia.”

That’s from the peer review decision letter. It’s not difficult to click on it and read it."
913,Makes a lot more sense when you put all the information together haha thanks
914,Just copied and pasted :)
915,"The most fascinating to me was the Washington study where they just lopped off the first hour, not replacing it later in the day. Performance _still_ increased, and now students and teachers have an extra hour.

Same thing at work tbh. I’m only really productive for 4-5 hours. Humans aren’t meant to sit and concentrate on one thing for 8 hours."
916,"I am unable to check the study right now, but did it account for the teachers also getting a later start? That is, did teachers also perform better starting work later and thus improve their student outcomes?"
917,Link to abstract:- [Interplay of chronotype and school timing predicts school performance](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0820-2)
918,"An excerpt 

> So, what does this tell us about chronotypes? The report does extend previous results by showing that, on average, students benefit when there's a better match between chronotype and school start time—it's not just a matter of early birds doing better when school starts early. But, at the same time, the results indicate that there's never a time of day when the students with the latest chronotype outperform the early birds.

>But there are at least two ways to look at that finding. One is that the early birds have a general academic advantage and get an extra boost when the school schedule matches their chronotype. While the latter advantage goes away as the chronotype mismatch gets larger, the former stays with them, allowing them to maintain parity at later school start times. Another way focuses on the finding that everyone always has a bit of social jet lag and suggests that morning people simply deal with it a bit better, which offsets the benefits that later chronotypes might see from later school start times.

In other words, the early bird does indeed catch the worm."

920,"I would be super interested in a study of where students were allowed to go to school when their bodies functioned well, what would be their best tested subjects of education?

I know I have been a night owl my whole life, but I had an especially hard time waking up early in high school"
921,This is also true for adult work times. Just sayin.
922,"Later school starts are a nice thought, but when your parents start work at 8-9am and need to drive you to school because there's no bus, there's not much room for flexibility."

925,"I taught at a late start high school. Since the kids got out later, they worked later (at jobs) - like until midnight or 1am during the week. I was shocked but I guess paying bills was the most important. They were just as tired, and we lost tons of hours of instruction for athletes who missed half the day for games multiple times a week. 

Four day school week with a day for extracurriculars might be more practical, but unfortunately, school is partly free child care. And too many kids *have* to work because their parents don't make enough money. The problems that need to be addressed are so much deeper than school start time"
926,"Ive just read Matthew Walker's why we sleep and there is a whole section in it about this very subject. Sleep cycles change throughout your life. Young people sleep later and wake later, it's got nothing to do with being lazy, it's just how the brain has evolved."
927,"I'd like see a study on what it would take for schools and workplaces to ever, *ever* take over 50 years of organizational science seriously. Because they just don't. It's as if the students and the workers (and their productivity) aren't the point of these institutions."

929,"In medical school 10 years ago it was well known teenagers require more sleep than adults.  And elderly require much less which is why they are out walking their dogs at 5am.

Adults think kids are just lazy and need to be broken but that’s not always the case (sometimes it is).  Physiology plays a part.  Would be great if there were some easy solutions to improve learning.  

Clearly would make schedules harder for parents tho.  If both parents are working and have to be at work by 8, kids have to be out before."
930,"I was an above average student most of the time, never excellent. When I had classes only in the afternoon I excelled, straight A. I'm an adult now, always struggling to wake up and be productive in the morning. Usually I feel active and motivated in the afternoon /night."
931,Think if i show this to my university's maths department they'll stop scheduling calc finals at 7:00am?
932,"It's been obvious my whole life that I've never been a morning person. I can sleep 7 hrs at night, wake up at 6am and feel exhausted and it takes me till 9am to fully wake up. Or I can sleep 7hrs, wake up at 9am and feel fully rested."
933,As someone with insomnia since junior high school. I always almost failed my 1st/2nd period classes regardless because of trouble staying awake.

936,"I remember saying this and every reply on the Comment chain was people saying it was a bad idea.

Even when linking 10 different sources that showed them they were wrong"
937,"A major issue with this is something most people don't want to hear:

After school sports are a thing, and many consider a very important thing. I'd imagine the Reddit crowd leans fairly heavily towards prioritizing academics over athletics, as would I. That being said, if you start school later, you get out of school later. Throughout much of the year, that means it gets dark quicker after school. Which leads to shorter practices. 

The other obvious issue is getting kids to school. Some have raised the idea that getting home FROM school is the same concept, as the kids get off school earlier than the parents get off work. This is an issue with motivation, however. Lots of kids need motivating to get to school on time. Hardly any need motivating to find their way back home. I was an excellent student, and still struggled at times to find motivation to get to school"

939,"Our local school district in northern Colorado just changed start times this year by almost two full hours... kids are thrilled, performance is up, parents are pissed... too many parents use school as daycare, get around that and there are huge benefits to later start..."
940,My SO works in a high school that starts at 7am. And I thought 8:15am was TOO DAMN EARLY.
941,I don't see why we think it would be different for students that the rest of the world.  I hate working early and just being up early in general.  I hate that people who show up at 6am and leave by 2 or 3pm are considered go getters while those who roll in at 10am but stay until 6 or 7pm are considered lazy.
942,Scientific study confirms people are different
943,School choice should include choice of start times.
944,this is why some students thrive in college even though struggling in high school
945,"My district (I'm a middle school teacher) switched to later start times two years ago and we haven't seen any positive increase in scores, behavior, or attendance. We felt like pessimistic little teachers when we said it, but starting school an hour later means kids will just stay up an hour later the night before."
946,Correct me if I am wrong I believe this is why German schools start at later times. Always thought that was a cool idea until you get a job and get a shock getting up early!
947,"It doesn't work if the students don't sleep, color me shocked."
948,Interesting...my school actually shifted start time by an hour and a half next year!
949,Completely has to do with the home life. Since there is virtually nothing a school can do to improve the home life later start times are better.
950,"My home room bell would ring at 7:15 am, during high school. I also lived pretty much right next door to high school. I was chronically late, like I’m pretty sure I got close to triple digit tardies. 

An interesting trend I noticed, with no effort exerted on my part, was that if I was late it was either just by a few minutes, or an entire period. But this was not due to me going “oh I’m 20 minutes late, I may as well be an hour late.” I just seemed to either oversleep by like 10 minutes, or an hour and 10 minutes."
951,"Asking a teenager to be asleep by 10 is like asking an adult to be asleep by 6pm. A teenagers preference for staying up late is a BIOLOGICAL process which you cannot simply train them out of. Exactly why this happens is unknown, it's theorised it's something to do with teenagers being able to socialise with eachother alone if they simply stay up later than the adults - at a time when they are becoming more responsible and gaining independence. 

As we age (post 64) the opposite happens, with the elderly often going to bed and waking up very early. This is not a generational thing, unfortunately as we age our ability to sleep longer slowly deminishes, meaning the elderly can't help but wake up early, thus achieving little sleep. They then go to bed earlier and earlier as they are so tired, becoming more and more unknowingly sleep deprived."
952,"I would say in general, societies sleep patterns are no natural for humans."
953,American Schools: WOW! This is worthless!
954,But how does this help kids learn that no one really cares about their well-being? Especially those who will enslave... I mean hire them.
955,Students sleep late. Less sleep less concentration
956,I wonder if some sleep earlier and some don't.
957,Did they track the kids that ride the bus?
958,"Really doesn't matter to be honest, I doubt anyone was ever wondering whether, on average, students would perform better if they went later in the day. The problem is how prevalent a morning to evening schedule is for parents. Parents won't and can't often times, agree to schools changing to some weird schedule that makes everything difficult and awkward for all parties involved. Best you could hope for is a different schedule for Seniors in HS at most."
959,"This is, to me, the reason permanent DST is a really bad idea."
960,This is due to Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder which for some develops and becomes more pronounced in their teen years.
961,This is why I was better at college (afternoon classes) than I was high school. I’ve never been good at mornings. I feel foggy and gross until I’ve been up a few hours
962,">some people are not morning people

Groundbreaking scientific research"
963,While I would have preferred a later start time I'm curious what the long term changes would be. I wonder if teenagers lack of self control would just lead to them staying up till 2am every night rather than 11 or 12pm doing the same activities that cut into their sleep currently.
964,"Unless it's Reddit, TV, video games, etc."
965,"I wonder if that would be worthwhile to parents since I believe the major reason school days continue to be the length they are is because they provide ""free"" daycare."
966,"In Austria, they recently made 12 hour workdays legal. My brain is fried after 9 hours. There were protests, but the conservative party just ignored them. They were like ""But the poor business owners!""."

968,"I’m not surprised. I was one of those people who was constantly sleeping in class because it was just too early and the day was too long for me to pay attention. I also have ADD, and all those things combined just made school a nightmare for me. However, I was blessed with the ability to not pay a single bit of attention and still somehow absorb information. I made better grades than like 90 percent of my classmates in “honors” classes without even trying. The 8-3 schedule isn’t a good system for people like me that pick up information quickly and also have a hard time focusing for long periods of time."
969,Not an early bird. Fortunately I have the late shift at Chipotle.
970,That’s the thing though most workers aren’t actually working their whole day
971,"I sleep for 3 - 4 hours of my work day. So productive the rest of the time, though"
972,"But it isn't necessarily one thing though right? At school you'll favour some subjects over others which may be divided into 4-5 different subjects in primary and secondary school. I think my sleep schedule has actually gotten better in college consider I may have 1-2 classes max a day. Yes it is a given that evening classes aren't ideal for most students but hey if it means I can sleep in until noon, I'm sold. Honestly younger me would have been stoked for that change in schedule if he knew."
973,"The interesting thing is if you actually enjoy your job that doesn't apply as much. I'm with you for every other job I ever had, now that I found a job I love I can go all day most days.      

As far as school I had a very difficult time falling asleep early+getting up early. To the point I needed to be shaken awake rather harshly by my parents or I simply would not get up, not cuz I didn't want too, I would just fall right back to sleep. It was really hard on my parents jobs basically having to drag me out of bed."
974,The reason school is so long in the US is that we don’t have universal child care and wages are low enough that most families have to have both adults working full time.

979,"I think the study only measures student academic performance. This makes sense because you can measure outcomes and growth with tests.
But to answer your question with a question, how could you even begin to measure teacher performance?

To clarify: I am a high school educator and in my near decade of experience I have witnessed that good instruction has a major influence on performance. However, some students will perform well no matter what, and some students will perform poorly, unfortunately, no matter how much care and intervention you apply. Statistically speaking, I don’t know that any significant difference can be discerned when you change the start time of school and see a change in student performance. Is it because the students needed a later start time? Or because the instructors needed a later start time to be more effective? Too hard to measure the impact of teacher instruction alone when the start time influences both."

981,True. After a lifetime of being a night owl I found in my mid 30's I've started turning into more of an early riser.
982,Interesting but it makes sense the timing of the school has to match schedule of parents who have to go to work. They have to get the kids out first for them to go to work.
983,"Wait, the abstract says night school was better for some kids. They didn't even look at starting school a moderate amount of time later. They said everyone did worse in the afternoon, so why would we want to push more classes to that time slot?"
984,The worm has been designed to advantage the early bird
985,">But, at the same time, the results indicate that there's never a time of day when the students with the latest chronotype outperform the early birds.

Well of course -- the emphasis is on time of *day*.        Night owls won't get an advantage during the *day*.  

They're called ""night owls"" for a reason.  

When it's 9pm and the ""early birds"" are crashing and have to go to bed because their brains are falling asleep, the night owls are just getting started.   

If the schools are testing who is going to perform better from 11 am -- 4 pm, both groups would be performing the same."

992,It’s more true for teenagers. Their circadian rhythms are different than (most) adults.
993,"Absolutely. Doing shift work at BK, I ended up gravitating to closing shifts. Opens I was always tired, fumbly, and didn't work at my best. Shifts starting around 11am-12pm I was okay with, not so bad. But the close was where I was the most active/productive. After a few months of random shifts it was noticed, and I got nothing but closes - which I was actually happy about."

995,"This is what everyone always brings up. I mean kids are out about 3:00 but parents aren't home until 5-6, what's the difference? Like how do you get home without them. You could use that same transportation method before school too in theory..."

1000,"Also, even if there are buses, they’re usually the same buses for elementary, middle and high school driving similar, if not the same, routes. That means the starts need to be offset to accommodate pickups for each level of students."
1001,"yeah that's what's lost in all these studies. Moving school to be an hour later means school busses are running at rush hour now. Traffic would become a nightmare. Or jobs would also just shift to later in the day to compensate, and now parents are getting home at 6pm having to cook dinner. School doesn't just start at 8:30 because it's tradition, it's because family life is built around that schedule. All that would happen is kids would still get dropped off at 8am and just wait there an extra hour for school to start because parents can't go to work later and can't leave their kids at home."
1002,Don't forget all extra curricular activities will end later too
1003,"with TV, computers, phones, games, etc, kids sleep much later.

Generally speaking I'd say most states have laws for kids work schedule. I think it was until 10 PM on school nights in my area maybe 11PM."
1009,"In my district we start late (9am for high school) but it’s illegal in my state (Texas) for employers to allow employees under 18 to work past 10:30 pm on a school night.  Maybe passing/enforcing those protections for teen employees would be the place to start?

Honestly though I doubt that teens who needed the money wouldn’t work as late as they were allowed (by parents or employers) even with a 7:20 am school start time.  Teenagers have a sleep-wake cycle that is different from adults’ or younger kids’ so even when they don’t work late they will generally not fall asleep early enough to get enough sleep for an early start time."
1010,"Yes, but fixing one thing will force us to consider and fix the next thing.

Unfortunately we can't just scrap our school system and start over, especially with the worst leeches in the entire education system trying to convert the whole thing to ~~a massive money giveaway to the rich~~ Charter Schools so it is what it is."
1011,"This was my case back in school. Class started at 7, got out at 230, at work by 3 or 5 and worked till 10 to as late as 230, though usually on weeknights was out shortly rafter midnight. Worked 5 nights a week, with 4 usually being before a school day. School was for sleeping. I was a bit of a strange performer in school, low GPA (2.5), and high absences/tardiness, but among the highest test scores in the school and got excellent grades in my AP courses and a few others that were actually interesting or challenging. Most teachers didn't get it. Don't know how many lectures I got about work ethic."
1012,Idk where you are but in CA it's illegal for minors to work past 10 on a school night.

Always been a night owl and my job normally had us get there at 7 am. This job I'm on right now starts at 4 pm.

Last night, at 2 AM, when everyone else was exhausted, I was as energetic as most people are during the day.

I hate being a night owl though. Most people aren't up late at night and the ones that are... Well theres reasons most of them work at night.

Its physically exhausting to be up during the day but mentally exhausting to be up at night"
1020,This is why I work third shift.
1021,"I dropped out of HS because I couldn't get up early. Then I redid it and just skipped the first 2 classes every day. Despite not attending a third of my classes and having my grades docked by some teachers I tied for first in my class at the end. Most of that probably came from being in my twenties, but I'm sure some of it came from actually getting some sleep."
1022,That’s just horrible
1023,"This is beautifully explained in ""Why we sleep"" by M. Walker. Has to do with the fact that your sleep buildup and sleep rhythm are in fact 2 different things."
1024,"This is my sleep pattern almost exactly. I have tried ""fixing"" it many ways but nothing sticks. Interestingly, I wake up earliest naturally on the weekends by a large margin."
1025,"Remember my very first class of the day in 9th grade was something having to do with maps. Every morning when I'm still barely awake, the teacher would shut off the lights and project maps on a screen to discuss parts of the world in a very slow, monotone voice the entire period. I would literally be passed out in a lake of drool within 3 minutes of the lights going off and sleep till the teacher woke me up after the bell rung."
1026,"> Lots of kids need motivating to get to school on time. Hardly any need motivating to find their way back home

They don't need motivation to get to school, they need motivation to get up. Going home is easy because you're already up."
1027,"One of my kids is an athlete, and grades 7-12 switched to a later start time starting in his sophomore year. The teams just accommodated it. Probably the biggest hardship was having to leave school early for some games and meets - he would occasionally have to make up a test or assignment during lunch. But he loved loved loved the extra 45 min in the morning - he felt it made all the difference, and his grades shot up. He was quite jealous of his younger brother."
1028,"Sounds like schools should get out of the sports game. If sports, which serve a minority of students, dictate the rest of the school, something is broken. Time for weekend sports and city leagues. This is getting ridiculous. Every study shows that we are shortchanging students to cater to athletes."
1029,"There are alternatives, including before school athletics. And don’t say that defeats the purpose, because that would only affect the small number who would participate in them at that time. There could (and would) still be both after school and during the school day athletics."
1030,Has the article taken into account how much they sleep? I can imagine the students just sleeping less if they have early classes because they are students and stay up too late. Thus decreasing performance
1031,They are called EXTRAcurriculars for a reason. If they are so important they can come in before school. Why make the many suffer for the few?
1032,"I did theater after school, and when my school considered switching to a late start time we would have had rehearsals starting at 6:30am instead of 2:30pm. It would have been awful and would probably have severely impacted the amount of people willing to participate. My school didn’t have sports but it’s the same idea - you either have to be up incredibly early or out very late to practice. Late start times are logistically difficult."
1033,"One rebuttal I can have for this, is to schedule the athletics in the middle of the day (by breaking for a few hours and doing the sports things), or schedule it a bit earlier in the day, and have classes following."
1034,"Later start times (for middle and high school only) have worked fine in NEISD, a consistently high performing and well regarded (and ethnically/socioeconomically diverse) school district in San Antonio, Texas.  Being Texans they still take their school sports VERY seriously, they just do a significant portion of the practices in the morning (when it’s cooler anyway) and use more lights for evening practices.  

Morning practices don’t work for everyone of course — some gifted athletes unfortunately don’t participate in the school sports and some gifted musicians don’t participate in the band because they can’t adjust to the early morning practice time.  But because the true point of school is, y’know, the school part, it’s more important to start the mandatory school day at a time that benefits the most students.

Most students (again at the middle and high school level) are plenty motivated to get to school without their parents’ supervision.  It’s a social experience and most adolescents do truly want to finish high school and want to avoid the consequences of truancy even if those consequences are at the end of the week rather than in the form of a parent nagging you out the door."
1035,Exact same case with me.
1036,"It's definitely the ""early bird gets the worm"" mentality. It's not going to go away either."
1037,"For me changing it from 7 to 8 am wouldn’t do much, but changing it from 7 to 10 am would."
1038,You do realize teenagers can’t fall asleep due to their circadian rhythm usually till 11 pm.  This has been established for a while.  In regards to test scores there are plenty of studies that show improvement from graduation rates to performance improvement in standardized testing.
1039,"Our school did this two years ago too! We saw a huge decrease is the number of 1st period tardies and just anecdotally, I almost never have kids fall asleep. 

What’s funny though is the kids HATE it!! They all complain about getting out later. I love it though. I have so much time to sleep in and relax and enjoy my coffee when the sun is already up each morning."
1040,"I don’t get how starting school so early when you’re younger is comparable. People have to adjust their sleep schedule so often in adult life, whether it’s for a few days at a time or adjusting to an entirely new lifestyle. Also not every job starts at 8am.

The only thing that can prepare you for that is the experience itself because it’s unique to each person and you get better at it as you get older."
1041,"Except you don't because your circadian rhythm shifts back after your teenage years, IIRC."
1042,"Teenagers require more sleep than adults. With early morning starts, most kids aren't going to bed earlier so they are just getting less sleep. With late starts, kids can sleep for longer hours.

I think it's better that kids get their needed sleep for development and then get shocked later in life, than not getting enough sleep all through school years but no shock later."
1043,They controlled for bedtime and sleep duration.
1044,that's not the point as I understand it. not the amount of Sleeptime rather then the daytime is the point in this discussion. so it would be okay to stay up until 2am and stand up again at 8am.
1045,"Some other research has shown that moving back school starting time by 1 hour leads to 20 min more sleep on average. So the kids do stay up later, but not enough to negate the sleeping in."
1046,All of which are specifically designed to captivate our attention for as long as humanly possible.
1047,"I don't think anyone focuses on one particular aspect of Reddit for 8 hours; the site as a whole can capture attention for long periods because it allows people to flit from subject to subject as their interest dictates, rather than forcing their interest to  conform to one particular task for 8 hours.

Ditto for games and TV."

1049,"I feel like you and I have different definitions of the word ""concentrate""... mindlessly scrolling through reddit, or binge watching a TV show cannot be said to be intellectually stimulating or require much concentration at all."
1050,"That’s consumption, not production."
1051,"That's not really concentrating, though. You're probably mind-wandering and watching TV while browsing Reddit at home."
1052,I rarely can do that.  As someone who loves to play video games I rarely can play one for more than 2 to 3 hours.  Only a really interesting TV show (anime) or book can keep my attention for over 4 and even the best of those have me swapping when the story gets to a slow point.
1053,That's not exactly focused attention.
1054,[removed]
1055,8 hours?! I can't do any of those for 8 hours
1056,That’s not ONE thing tho ;)
1057,"I’ve played video games my entire life, and I can’t play them for long that a few hours at a time.  I’m envious of anyone who can honestly."
1058,"Even video games and TV need a break for me.
I once played Twisted Metal Small Brawl for 6 hoirs straight, because I didn't have a memory card, but wanted to play as trapper.
It was not worth it haha."
1059,"Hey, I don’t concentrate on those, either. I’m usually checking Reddit or playing mobile games while also playing a video game on my PS4. Or at least watching YouTube. I switch between multiple forms of entertainment, basically. I doubt I could even watch the Marvel Movie Marathon that I want to watch without messing around on my iPod at points."
1060,"But that's entertaining, it's different.

If your job is entertaining 8 hours a day, sure.

But even Twitch streamers struggle to stay interested on a 8 hours stream. They get fatigue."
1061,"I mean, you're joking.  But even with those leisure and entertainment activities, people are only devoting peak attention to each for a limited amount of time.  You may be on reddit all day but you're not constantly replying and actually consuming content that requires some brain power.  Cat photos and dumb meme images are easy to consume.  But if you have to read an article, there's only so much that people actually pay attention to.

Or with videogames.  Even back in the days of WoW and Evercrack, people aren't taking on in-game activities that are strenuous for their entire time playing.  They're often doing other more laid back stuff like socializing, etc.  And how often do you hear about people speaking of their backlog of games as if it's some chore they have to clear out.

And with TV, with the availability of ready access to endless number of shows and entire seasons, people aren't binge watching as much you'd like to think.  Unless it's a particularly compelling show like Breaking Bad or Fargo or something, people actually get fatigued and overwhelmed by what they have to watch.  Most of my Netflix-ing consists of playing The Office in the background while I do other stuff.  Much how like I handle the work at my actual office.

So my point is, we may sit around and constantly be redditing, playing videogames and playing TV shows for hours at a time, but we're not always actively engaging in those activities."
1062,Doesn’t explain middle and high school
1063,"I'm gonna just say it isn't ""free"" you pay taxes. Also parents would probably be ok with it if kids didnt come home with 5 to 6 hours of homework every night, I'm basically working 10 hours a day and then doing home work till 8 or 9pm. To me the system is broken I'm basically the teacher and I dont get paid to do it."
1064,"I’m not exactly pro 12hr work days, but my dad worked with a semiconductor company in the U.S. that moved their production to a 10hr day, 4 days a week. Because the startup/shut down time remains the same day to day they were productive for more hours over 4 days than they had been at 5.  Overall operating costs dropped since they didn’t have lights/environmentals on as much and the staff liked the 3-day weekends."
1065,"Ah. But there's a big trade off.

I LOVE 12 hour shifts. Always get a 3 or 4 day weekend because you get your 40 hours in, in about 3 days."
1066,Some people really like working 3-12 one week and 4-12 the next. They only work 7 days out of every 14.
1067,[removed]
1068,I'm a nurse and I have been working 12 hours shifts since the start of my career. I actually prefer 12 hours over 8 hours. I get more days off in exchange.
1069,"I’m more shocked at finding out that they were illegal in the past. Whats wrong with 12 hour shifts? Just because they are legal doesn’t mean you yourself have to work 12 hours, but if someone wants the extra money they should have the option to work longer."
1070,"It only gets worse once you enter the workforce, assuming you’re in the US. What I would give to only have to work 7-3 every day."
1071,"This is a serious reply,  I think the measure of the student IS the measure of the student. Or a strong correlation. 

Dammit I can't string together the words to be more concise.  

The students can't be doing better if their instructors are doing worse?"
1072,"You measure teacher performance by student performance right? If the students are doing better, then the teachers should be part of the reason why. Or at least that was my original thought; I also didn't read the study but I imagine it's hard to tell specifically whether the adjusted schedule helped better student performance or the teachers did, or both, and to what extent did each help?"
1073,">But to answer your question with a question, how could you even begin to measure teacher performance?

Fellow teacher here. One easy way is through performance. Others could be homework completion, kids coming in for extra help, class averages?"
1074,"This argument is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If all the parents in the workforce suddenly told their bosses they had to start working an hour later, then all the employers would adjust shift times."
1075,And that mindset is why we still treat schools as daycares. Were 14-18 year-olds incapable of taking care of themselves a century ago?
1076,Right.  It's always been timed to working parents schedules and that's why it sucks
1077,Eh but then who’s picking them up? Problem still exists.
1078,My ass was on the bus and my parents had time to drop me off
1079,"Yeah that saying implies that the worm doesn't have to be there for good stuff to happen..But in truth its critical to the whole metaphor.  If worms all of the sudden changed their schedule, English teachers nationwide would be confused about how to incentivize people to be more attentive in the morning."
1080,They specifically said that people that sleep later never outperform those that naturally wake earlier. There is no designed advantage. It is what it is.
1081,"Also, it's not good to be an early worm."
1082,"As a ""night owl"" this rings so true. Like sure I can work on my assignments during the day, but man, inspiration sure seems to strike later at night. This can be problematic as a chronic procrastinator, but man do I submit some damn fine work."
1083,That might not work so well because the night owls in the US still operate in an early bird world. School would be the only thing adjusted.
1084,And people wonder why online charter schools are so popular...
1085,"I mean they don't say that you absolutely *can't* change your chronotype, they're just kind of identifying it as a thing."
1086,"And then run schools at all hours of the day to accommodate, apparently"

1088,">but seeing the sun set while I'm in an office is kind of depressing.

That happens from october to march up here in the north."
1089,"My parents left work before I left for school like my entire childhood. They woke me up got me ready and then I waited for the Bus after they left. The school times are actually pretty stupid because they have older kids (middle school and high school) go to school first and come home last. So the natural cheap childcare of family friend or older sibling is lost. If anything Elementary kids should go to school first and come home last. Make up the time by having longer session of Music, Art, Gym, and Recess."
1090,[removed]
1091,Before school care.
1092,Frequently those kids are in some sort of after school program.
1093,"> I mean kids are out about 3:00 but parents aren't home until 5-6, what's the difference?

Imagine an 8 year old getting out of bed and to the bus on time by themselves, that's significantly more difficult than asking them to play at a friends house after school."
1094,"A lot of kids wait. They do their homework or hangout with friends or clown around until they either 1. Walk home 2. Their parents pick them up 3. They’re homeless so w/e 4. They stay at a friends house for the day.

I went to a private school and there were multiples of each of my categories at any given time."

1100,"That's just based on my conversations with them - they'd work 4-12. I personally worked 3 hour shifts in high school, but it was for money to buy, like, ice cream at Friendly's. 

I agree that New York had very strict laws for minors, but Georgia was a whole other country it seemed. You could start working and driving younger there. Even working til 11, if you still have homework, you're not getting much sleep."

1105,"You can’t pass high school by never showing up to your first two periods unless those periods are electives. And even then, your GPA would be fucked."
1106,"I think plenty of people have trouble leaving on time to get anywhere, regardless of how awake they are. Nobody wants to stop whatever they're doing (whether that is sleeping, watching tv, playing video games, whatever) to go someplace, especially if they don't *really* want to be there."
1107,"I would have never gone to school if I wasn’t forced to. I definitely needed motivation. If my parents didn’t pay attention, I would never have shown up.

When I was in-between girlfriends, I found that my motivation to go to school was terrible. Or if I was looking forward to a class, I found that I would feel a lot more awake and wanted to go to school. It only took one class that I was looking forward to to get motivated. 

My 7th grade year was the best year I had in school. Because in my 4th period, which was a study hall before lunch, the teacher let me play his guitar all period. My grades reflected well, which was a surprise to my parents because I was never an academic during K-12."
1108,"I think they need both. As a kid, I would’ve ate poison before I’d willingly go to school."
1109,"Honestly don't get the bag. But what if the kids had to start and end practice a little bit later? Well they all got an extra hour of sleep so they are probably doing ok. Like all we are doing is shifting the schedule not adding or removing an hr from the day.

The only issue I can see is with elementary schools but they already start later than jr/sr high anyways."
1110,"And even then, starting your day with exercise instead of ending the day with it would provide a much needed energy boost for your initial classes. I've never felt as good and productive as when I would go to gym before class on days that I start around mid-day. Sadly, I can't afford to do the same on normal days as that would mean I'd need to be up and running by 4-5AM just to be able to get back home and shower/get ready by 7:30.(My gym doesn't even open that early to begin with).

I think starting the school day later would be beneficial EVEN if you're doing extracurricular activities like sports. Lord knows how many times I've gone to the gym after school only to come back home physically energized but too mentally out of it to do any assignments or catching up on reading material."
1111,Got a great idea keep the theatre practice after school... Even if you shift from 2:30 to 4:30 you can still put in 1.5 hrs and it would be 6PM which I would venture to guess is around the time parents would be fully capable of picking a kid up if needed or be able to start dinner.
1112,For me the last year or two of highschool I was struggling to fall asleep by 3am most nights and that problem has continued on to this day.
1113,"Exactly. Read ""Why we Sleep"" by Matthew Walker. That book goes into detail about how it matters WHEN you sleep and are awake as much as it matters how much you are asleep and awake. Our circadian rhythm causes us to be more wakeful or drowsy depending on the time of day, regardless of how much sleep we actually get."
1114,And which aren't very productive...
1115,"They’re also elective activity. There’s something to be said for society dictating where you spend your time. When you want to, you spend more there. 

For example, when i wanted to write code for work. 10 hour days weren’t trying.  Now because i don’t see the value in it 1 hour behind the screen is enough to make me want to get up and lose my mind. 

Makes me wonder if TV and reddit are captivating or it’s just because i don’t have to be there doing that.. I want to. Chicken before the egg type thing."
1116,Then maybe they (I don't know who 'they' is) should make jobs that are designed to captivate our attention for as long as humanly possible so that wage slavery doesn't suck. Or just tear down the whole system.
1117,"And even then, how often are we ACTUALLY actively focusing on those things for 8 nearly consecutive hours at a time? At least for me, even if I'm really interested in a game, I can only really concentrate on it for maybe 3 or 4 hours at a time before I notice myself getting worse, missing details, etc."
1118,Which even on adderall I can't do haha.
1119,Which is why reddit went from pages to infinite scroll.
1120,And you're not trying to retain everything you read for the test next week.
1121,Really? I really only max out at 1.5ish hours of gaming at peak and then it’s off to Titanfall 2 for some mindless grunt slaying
1122,"Yep, I'm playing a game on one monitor while I have Reddit and Youtube or some kind of stream split on my other monitor. Concentrating on one thing is about the last thing I'm doing."
1123,"I can definitely concentrate on an intense game for 8-10 hours straight (with breaks), it's quite exhausting but possible"
1124,"Consider yourself lucky. It can really damage your health if you sit on the computer for longer than that, even if you are otherwise healthy and exercise.

1127,"I’m a high school teacher, their parents ABSOLUTELY use us as daycare! They don’t want their teens unsupervised, for good reason."
1128,Middle and high school students should be able to get themselves up and ready and stay home alone for a couple hours.
1129,"New studies show that homework doesn't help. Hopefully your kids' schools pick up on the trend sooner rather than later.

Of course, it means it will get adopted by your school district the week after your youngest graduates."
1130,What kind of school are your kids in that they get 5-6 hours of homework that is difficult enough to need parental tutoring? I haven't heard of this being an issue in a long time.
1131,"I'm not saying that kids dont get 5 to 6 hours of homework somewhere,  but that is wildly different than my experience (unless things changed in the last decade!). Going to a ""good"" school and having almost all honors or AP courses, I probably had a maximum of 1-2 hours of homework a day."
1132,"What about a... *3* day work week, with 13hr days?? For a 4 day weekend 🤔"
1133,"4 10's is pretty common
I've also heard of 3 12's and a pickup shift"
1134,Is there also a law that caps the work week at 40 hours?
1135,I work a 12 hours shift every week. My boss still expects me to put in 9 hour shifts the other 5 days of the work week  (Saturday is also a work day).
1136,"I know a few places that will run 5 or even 7 12's.

7-12's is usually done in chunks though so you get weeks or months off"
1137,">always

No. Maybe for you, but many jobs that have people working 12s do 5 and 6 day weeks."
1138,"Yeah, but 6 12 hour shifts a week will burn you out fast."
1139,"Yeah, I think it definitely depends on the person and the job. I LOVE working 12-hour days in my hospital, but I don't think I would want to do it in an office or an assembly line!"

1142,With homework it’s 12 hours a day. I’m grateful that I do get a good public education (or good enough) but it can be overwhelming sometimes.
1143,"You’re saying that student performance is directly correlated with teacher performance. As such if a teacher performs better their students will preform better as an aggregate as well. If the teacher struggles with performance their students will struggle as a group as well. Like any group their will be statistical outliers. 

This is what you were trying to say, correct?"
1144,"Measuring teacher performance by student performance is the slipperiest of slopes.



Go check out arguments around merit based pay based if you're interested in why."
1145,Yep. The weight of the workforce would bend regular working hours easily.
1146,"Thing is, we aren't productive for 8h either. We could all start working 6h, lop that first hour off."
1147,Well blame the millions years of history where work began during daylight.
1148,"A century or so ago 14-18 year olds were already in the workforce due to an average need for a much lower level of education. In todays general workforce people aren't educated enough until a few years later, they aren't yet ready en masse to begin to contribute to society.  

That's what happens when a population moves from a labour based workforce to an intelligence based workforce."
1149,Not all school is made up of highschool....
1150,"If those hours are bad for kids they’re probably bad for adults too, even if not to quite the same extent"
1151,[deleted]
1152,"Kids should walk to and from school. If they can't, they live too far away."
1153,Which still means they were in the house when you left for the bus...
1154,"No, I think the metaphor implies that the bird willing to get out of bed gets the worm while the lazy bird who keep hitting the snooze doesn’t because they’ve all been eaten already"
1155,"I bet they would see an effect if the start time was, say, 10pm."
1156,I’d like to see how they were measuring performance. I’m a night owl and a lot of other night owls I know are definitely elite performers in their field.
1157,"That's not at all what the excerpt says. It says that using morning schedules gave early-chronotype people a significant increase in performance gap vs. using later schedules. The earlier a schedule begins, the worse it makes later-chronotype people perform. There's an absolute advantage that morning schedules give to early-chronotypes."
1158,"I do my best writing when I’m lying in bed trying and failing to fall sleep, then have to get up to write it down so I don’t forget it in the morning (And I always forget  it in the morning if I don’t write it down). Rinse and repeat until I finally fall asleep at a very late hour, and have to force myself to get up with minimal sleep because I’m “supposed to be” writing in the morning and afternoon, not at 4am."
1159,There are lots of jobs where this doesn't hold true. I work in a medical lab and we have evening and midnight shifts.
1160,I think mostly for convenience and one of those convenience is doing the work at any time you want. Not having to be in a specific place at a specific time is great.
1161,"That’s how it is in our district. K-5 7:45am, 6-8 8:30am, 9-12 9:10 am. It’s wonderful and I can’t imagine having it any other way.

Depending on extra-curriculars the high schoolers sometimes have to go in at 7am but that’s not an every day thing."
1162,National free child care? I'm on-board.
1163,So have a before school program
1164,"The biggest benefits for late start times are for older kids.  Elementary age kids should still start early, partly because they can’t get themselves ready for school without adult supervision, partly because their brains are just wired to go to bed early and wake up early"
1165,"You dont need to move the time back for little kids, but in high school teens got puberty snd stuff which makes you go to sleep and wake up much later

Also why cant they hang out with their friend in the morning before school too?"
1166,There were homeless kids at a private school?
1167,"academics>everything else

1170,"I know this is anecdotal, but I skipped A LOT, like 50 days a year or something, and I didn't even once have the issue that I didn't go to school when I was awake at the right time. I only ever skipped when I couldn't get up or when I was late already. A lot of people also skipped because they wanted to avoid a deadline or something, but never because they didn't feel like school when they were already up."
1171,"In some districts (not ours) they made the elementary schools earlier than the high school to facilitate the bus schedules. Many working parents prefer that since they can get their little ones off to school before work. Younger kids tend to wake up earlier, and it’s the little ones who needs parental help in the morning, not the older kids."
1172,[removed]
1173,who tf cares?? the notion that we must be productive is perpetuated by the ruling class so that we can make them more money
1174,Why do I get the sense that you look down on people who aren't spending every waking hour of the day trying to make wealthy people even wealthier while spending next to no time for themselves? People with that outlook are truly detestable.
1175,"And you don't concentrate on one thing for 8 hours, but many different things for a few minutes/seconds."
1176,Thanks for this. I was sleep deprived all through high school.  I was taking a ton of AP classes. My AP Psychology class started at zero period an hour before school started.  Then after school I took extra classes at a community college.  My parents also worked long hours so it worked for both of us.

1178,"I read an interesting study about this very suggestion.  If you’ve ever played a role playing game, there is an aspect of rpg’s called “grinding” where you repeat a mundane task over and over again... hours and hours of repetitive button clicking to increase your proficiency in some random skill for your character.

During these grinds, players are given small, incremental rewards, typically in the form of increasing levels or visible changes to your player avatar, for that particular skill.

People will WILLINGLY spend dozens if not hundreds of hours grinding for a number of different skills.

This study attempted to leverage a similar micro reward system with mundane work.  Like if you worked in a call center, you would get stat points for consecutive calls without a break.  Points and levels were public so your peers could see who was advancing.  It had a positive impact on employee’s views on these mundane tasks.

So maybe if you could become a level 20 fry cook, you may not hate it so much."
1179,"If you have an idea for a better economic system that has a precedent for success, I’m all ears. 

I think its also worth mentioning that if I forced you to play the same video game for eight hours straight, it would probably get old. It’s the repetition that sucks, not the activity in my opinion."

1181,Bruh somebody's gotta be a plumber how tf you gonna reinvent plumbing

1189,Heck! Some students love it. Their homes are horrible! Speaking from experience.  Christmas and Spring break times were not fun at home. I missed school.
1190,"I mean, that is why we have after school programs at my school. Some kids stay after school but the vast majority have parents available to pick them up whenever.  At least at the school I am teaching at."
1191,Should. But many wouldn’t. I would’ve skipped school on the reg if my mom didn’t drive me there every day.
1192,"But they can't. My district starts late one day a week so the staff can do meetings and crap. Those days many of the high school kids have to get themselves to school. 

Guess what day of the week has the most tardies?"
1193,That’s what I’m saying
1194,"I agree. Especially at a high school level (9th grade), that student should be responsible enough to get themselves up and ready and to school whether that is driving themselves or catching the bus."
1195,"Harris Cooper’s 2006 meta-analysis showed that homework is positively correlated with academic achievement at every level.   The relationship is very strong between 7th and 12th grade, but is present throughout school.

More recent research suggests that homework isn’t necessary until 4th or 5th grade. But beyond that, homework most certainly helps."
1196,"I agree some teachers do that, they just send study sheets home everyday for them to study for test its awesome, but that's a few not all. My kids have 4 teachers some do it some dont."
1197,"This is one of the many reasons I decided once my son is done with this school year, I am homeschooling. We are not doing it for the religious reasons (not religious at all) but the hours they spent in school is crazy to me and not to mention the time that you want a kid to wake up is crazy and you add homework in there( he is 6!!!!!!). They're kids, they need to enjoy that. I will prob be done with homeschooling in 3 hours tops with breaks in there. He is 6 right now and I want him to enjoy childhood because once you're an adult jobs and bills consume a large chunk of your day.  We will be pinching pennies here and there since we will be a one income household but i feel it s worth it. That's just my opinion."
1198,"It's insane how slowly schools adopt new policies. Homework has shown to be ineffective for 30 fuckin years and yet we still have morons coming up with class plans that include homework every night. School is for learning, home is for fun and family, not more school work."

1203,"No. But in the US a full time employee is someone who works over 32 hours and overtime (paid @ 1.5x wage) starts after 40 hours. So employers dont want to pay it.

Wouldn't that be a decent way to control for the benefits on the teacher?"

1214,I can’t focus in a morning at all. It has never made sense to me that jobs with no particular time of day constraints still insist on early morning starts.
1215,Wouldn't this potentially negate the advantages of starting later by still waking them up and putting them in a school mindset at the same early time?
1216,"Which schools already have , in NYC anyway."
1217,That defeats the whole purpose of the proposal (more sleep for students).
1218,"The failure is that education isn't a scarce resource so why treat it like one? The worm is always going to be there. The whole idea that everyone who gets up at 5 am will be successful is built by a broken system. 

If we just let people roll in at 9 am and still get their 40 hrs in why does it matter."
1219,">Interplay of chronotype and school timing predicts school performance

isnt this all subjective, in which the nightowl stays up late and gets things done on their own time?"
1220,"Most definitely. I feel most awake and intellectually energized starting right around 10pm. I bet those early birds would be fucked, though."
1221,"I've always felt like my brain doesn't really start to get going until later into the night. Anecdotal, but I do my best work at night from my personal experience."
1222,They have this at the elementary school I worked at. Before and after school day care programs. Some kids were there at 6 am and picked up at 5 pm.
1223,"Doesn’t this defeat the purpose? In this case the night-owls are forced to wake up early to get to the before school program. If they’re waking up earlier than their circadian rhythm dictates they should for a before school program, they might as well just start school early"
1224,Our school has both. There aren't many in the before school program. School starts at 8:45. I love it. (K-4)
1225,But doesn't that mean the kids arent getting the extra sleep in the morning?
1226,Then are you solving the problem though? The kids still have to wake up at the same time
1227,It can happen. Some districts and states have programs to help kids from low-income families get into and afford private schools. I have a coworker who's mother worked as the school janitor to pay his tuition.
1228,"Yes, the families usually came to a deal with the school or they take out of the benevolence fund at my old highschool. Every Friday and every Monday they had some special thing like “wear jeans for 5$” and the money donated was put aside for student families that had trouble making ends meet. That was one of several ways the school tried to take care of families who got hit by hard times."

1231,But that’s the point. You can easily spend 8 hours on things that aren’t productive but are fun. But doing something productive for 8 hours is draining even when it’s fun.
1232,The notion that we must be productive is perpetuated by our high levels of consumption
1233,Dawg ima need you to hop in the presidential race real quick plz
1234,"Or, you know, being able to feed yourself and your family. Or being able to save enough to where you don't have to worry about it. I do believe we are just human farm animals but the pressure to work and be productive is an evolutionary hard wiring that is played on, not constructed by anybody or anything but the history of the human race. There is no need to perpetuate it. The state of farming humans for revenue in today's age is as simple as owning a central bank and letting the population do what it does, completely free in their minds but shackled to their monetary system (paying taxes to a private institution year in and year out).

Whether we are free or not doesn't change the fact that the majority has to do something productive daily for individuals, and therefore civilization, to survive. We will always consume so we will always produce."
1235,Or it’s perpetuated by yourself and the need to feel successful?

1245,"This is called 'gamification' and its finding its way into all walks of life. Games are basically designed around the Skinner box (i.e. a little rodent held in a cage and given the choice to do nothing or hit a lever and be given a dose of cocaine).

Gamification obviously hits a wall in practicality when you try to attach it to jobs with more nebulous milestones. If you're a fry cook, quantifying your work is easy. When you are an immigration lawyer (as a wildly random example), it's much less so."

The linked study considered things like tardiness and found that late start times still resulted in better outcomes.  My school district in Texas has had later start times (no middle schools starting before 8:25 no high school before 8:50) for 20 years and tardiness has not been an outsized issue.

Edited for clarity — tardiness is still *an* issue, it always will be.  But it’s not a more significant issue than when the start times were earlier nor is it significantly more frequent than in comparable districts with earlier start times"

1273,"Education as a concept isn't a scarce resource, but educators to provide that education are. You can't just hire more teachers to teach on a shifted schedule, and you'd have logistical issues with how you distribute students and teachers with people starting at varying times throughout the day, and then handling extracurriculars where a 7-4 student and a 9-6 student both want to be on the football team, but practice is 4-6 to take advantage of the sunlight."
1274,"I guess that’s a good question, and depends on the business, in my business, we want to be there to support our clients when they need our support, so we match our hours to theirs, which is 830-5 for the most part. We also have a 8-430 shift and 9-530 shift to catch the outliers.

As far as the metaphor, you’re maybe being to literal. Yes, education is not scarce, but often the people willing to get up first and hit the ground running are the same go getters who will put in extra effort and outperform and get the most worms. True at school, true at work, true at lots of places.

1277,Before school program = nap time.
1278,"It would only defeat the purpose for some, in which case it would be zero change. For others it would be an improvement. Some gain, others don’t, but nobody loses.

1281,"Not entirely. Preformance isn't judged in before school programs. 

Sleeping in is one thing, but I think the main point of this article is that preformance increases as the day goes on. So moving more important activity to latter in the day is still a gain for those kids."

And we should have punitive taxation against companies that use a disproportionately large amount of freelancers and part time labor instead of hiring full time employees. Maybe not for fast food and other lower wage entry level positions but at professional positions for sure."
1334,Yes but it’s scientifically proven that teenagers need more sleep. Also teens don’t need to practice their whole lives just in case they end up with a career where they have to wake up early. They will be adults then and should be able to do it just fine

1355,"Probably not that much cash.  Here are a few challenges:

* The popular games with the biggest prizes mostly come and go.  If you switch games every 5 years to keep up with the trends, you don't really have any advantage over the real pros who spend more than 40 hours a week practicing.  If you pick a longtime favorite game like Starcraft 1, you'll never catch up to the pros who have a 20 year head start.

* You get older but the pros stay the same age.  I know age doesn't seem like a huge factor, but for many games the improved reaction times of younger players does give them an advantage."

1363,"I agree, they do need more sleep. I support a later start time.

What I’m saying is, the kids who aren’t impacted by the start time aren’t magical or lucky, lots of them choose to go to bed earlier so they can perform in the morning. They probably also make other good choices which is why they do better at any time of day as the article said."
1364,This is why it sucks for the whole family unit.
1365,"I can understand that if there’s no other choice. I don’t understand it in my sons case though, however. I don’t even work as long as he is at school and I’m a grown adult. He’s 5.. sorry. It grinds my gears. It’s the only school around though."
1366,"But NYC is loaded with non-school busses and is highly walkable isn’t it?  Wouldn’t middle and high schoolers be able to get themselves to school without their parents driving in a city where most of the population doesn’t drive anyway?  Obviously younger kids can’t just be sent to walk or ride transit alone but it’s primarily adolescents who benefit from later start times.

One is based upon capitalism with appropriate restraints and adjustments made for market failure and externalities.  Ultimately production is still largely controlled by public ownership of capital and owners of capital controlling the means of production.  The other is a system where the government and bureaucrats have tight control over production, in many cases ownership and profits as well.  I like the former and in my view the latter naturally degrades into oppression and a authoritarian state.

1378,"Piggybacking on your comment since the reply to it that I'd meant to address was deleted. Said something along the lines of ""but if school starts later they'll just stay up later.""

As a high performing student I would regularly have sleep stolen from me so I could do enough busy-homework to keep my grades halfway decent; the rest of the time I spent awake late at night, I was just trying to savor what portion of my adolescence I had control over. Before I was through my junior year of high school, I despised the system for both imposing this shackle and doing so while failing to provide me much of use for the amount of time I was forced to invest in it. This was a feeling that had been brewing for years, and by the time I was fully conscious of it, most of my youth was already wasted. It didn't take much time for this to completely whittle away any amount of effort I had previously been willing to apply to appease others, yet I'd go out of my way to teach myself about various subjects of personal interest in my own time. 

There are only so many hours in a day, and the public educational standard is essentially a full time authoritarian indoctrination program that robs its subjects of a third of their life for 12+ years while providing a pittance of rudimentary life skills, if that. Unfortunately that period of life is also the only time most people aren't weighed down by wage slavery and all the other pleasant staples of modern society. You can't really blame kids for trying to make the most of their restricted free time - the system is at the root of their suppressed boredom and discontent. Whether that's a failure or a success is up to your interpretation of its intended outcomes."
1379,"Do the repetition more smartly then. 

Instead of only doing fractions for homework in the week you learned about them, do less of those but repeat them in smaller increments throughout the year. 

And then have it on a more liberal plan where students can prove that they know this stuff (and get excused from certain homework) and don't need the repetition. 

That's surely much more effective for long term memory than the way it was done in my school. Learn something, repeat it a lot, do the exam, forget most of it."

Sure there straight A's kid probably got into amazing colleges, but I knew that'd never be me. My family couldn't afford it and at that point I already knew which direction I wanted to go in. I started attending a 3 year tech school that you pretty much just needed a pulse and financing to get into. After 2 years I determined I learned all I could from them and decided to find work in the industry I wanted.

A year later I got a contract job working on websites, 3 months later I beat out 20 other people for a full time spot, and 12 years later I'm still there. I'm making well over double what I did when I started and my work life balance is unbeatable.

However, you can find their pods and get useful items, as well as audio logs from the survivors.

One of them is from a supposedly greatly renowned doctor, who was injured as well as infected with a disease, and he goes off on this surprisingly thought-provoking rant about how he’s unable to do anything.  
It really makes you think about the future and the continued evolution of technology.

Edit: Grabbed the transcription off the wiki:

>*”I'm not really a doctor. I know that's what my ID says, but I never have been. What does a doctor these days need to know about manually resetting bones? When was the last time a top surgeon actually cut someone open? That's what the robots are for!*

>*But what good is it when I'm not connected to the main network? I'm bleeding. I've got glowing green pustules growing on my hands.

1452,"It's been said that once a process is understood and can be programmed into a computer, it ceases to be an AI problem and becomes a simple computer program. You are not alone in this thought.

Computers can't play high level chess, that would require an AI. IBM creates deep blue.

Computers can't play high level go, that would require an AI. Deepmind creates AlphaGo.

Computers can't ______, that would require an AI. Then somebody makes a computer do that thing and publishes a paper describing how... And now it's just math and stats but no AI anymore.

1457,"No clue what any of that has to do with AI. They are programs created to do one specific job. Programmed.  Nothing to do with intelligence

As for the cat stuff, I have heard that before but again have no idea the validity of it or what it has to do with AI. Might need to break it down. 

At the end of the day, machines are not intelligent. Giving a machine the route of a course doesn't mean it figured it out. And usage of a tool that you had to show them how to use, does not mean itelligence. Learning the tool on its own from no programming would be inteligence. And those that you mentioned couldn't dream of ever doing anything without a guiding hand, or in their case, their programming. Hence ""not AI but a automated program."""

1461,I would say deep learning is closer to intelligence than A* ever was. Prove me wrong.
1462,That implies that we are paying the absolute minimum for the continued progress of the healthcare industry. I think the fact that both sides of the isle seem to agree that it is a bloated bastard in one way or another would refute that idea.
1463,Yes. Training more people is apparently not the way to reduce costs.
1464,I think he was clearly joking...
1465,"You would need to prove your self right first as you are the one making the claim. I am denying that AI has anything to do with intelligence. The burden of proof relies on the claimer.

That said, challenge accepted anyway. 

Deep learning is a system that is preset and premapped. This already null amd voids any chance of intelligence. 
A childs brain does not require a map. They create the map based on tools and observations that they created and decided on, on their own of their own accord, they do this via intelligence. Intelligence creates its own code from nothing. This is the part many AI people skip.

""AI"" needs to have some form of program first. If it were truly intelligent, it could start as a blank slate with no prior data, but this is impossible as it would just sit there AFK because it needs a process first, like ""the process of elimination,"" which is pre written code. Again, that of which a child would never need. Anything with intelligence could exist on its own merrit and not one written by someone else.

Humans today are educated but are far more stupid than people used to be. This is because education, programming, has nothing to do with intelligence. They are coded to remember and not to understand. Hence why they make such fantastic factory workers."
1466,"Med Schools have very strict class size limits, which is why there are so few doctors in the US. If we allowed more people to study medicine perhaps we might have more doctors... and surgeons."
1467,"You're describing Artificial Autonomy. Not artificial intelligence. We're not debating whether or not people have accepted it's use in the wrong situations or not, we know that's the case. A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) absolutely has to do with intelligence, because that's literally HALF the abbreviation. It would be called artificial autonomy if that's what we meant. The word ""intelligence"" is describing an artificial being's ability to create it's own processes, AND make decisions based on the results of those processes ad infinitum. Intelligence definitely also implies autonomy, but the two are absolutely not the same thing. We've had computer programs which can create their own processes for a very long time. Those processes have gotten more advanced, but that, on its own does not constitute intelligence. It's the ability to collect the information gained from various processes and draw it's own conclusion, to answer a question it asked. *That's* the piece most people miss, it's asking the questions of it's OWN volition. I don't believe we have anything capable of doing this at our current point in history. So, neither of you two are correct, you both got pieces right though, it's sort of a combination of your two ideas in the end.

A true, high level AI would be created by making a framework of some theoretical kind, then supplying a sort of spark, which would set the whole thing off. And while it would be running initially on our own processes, it would quickly replace them with it's own."

We are doing worse, in terms of overall emissions, but not as bad as we would have been without tech advances.

Which means that if tech continues to improve the field (as no doubt it will) we could reduce overall emissions (which is all that matters to climate change, temp forcing doesn’t take into account units produced) by maintaining or reducing consumption while continuing to fund research."

* ""Wow, you're pretty talented for a girl!"" → Basically insinuating that women in general suck, and reminding you that that's a standard you're always going to be judged by
* ""This is why we brought in a woman to do this!"" → Basically carving out acceptable roles for you to inhabit; and furthermore creates inferiority complexes if you're failing to live up to that standard yourself for any reason

Both are going to come across as hostile, regardless of what the speaker intends. 

And it doesn't have to be a sexist statement, necessarily: ""This is why we brought in a woman *to discuss issues of female reproductive health since the panel was previously all men last year!*"" is probably indicative of a positive change! But it'll still come across as hostile because it'll remind you that the space you're entering is one that used to be (and probably still is...) male-dominated, and even as you're assured that the circumstances are improving, you're also becoming keenly aware of how much things still need to improve.

So yeah. Lots of little tiny biases to cause stress, even in benevolent contexts where the speaker doesn't intend harm (and especially when they do)."

1498,"At minimum we need around 20-40 samples to declare something a normal distribution. Although the more samples the less influential a bias on the data can be. As long as the sample is randomly selected, which is harder and more expensive to do than you'd think. 

This is a smaller sample, which would make it's results less definitive and more speculative. It doesn't mean that it's not valuable information. We do know that it was consistent that benevolent sexism caused more feelings of self doubt. 

Although we can also ask the question of if it was a more targeted criticism because it used part of their Identity while the control is more neutral and impersonal. 

We could and should ask if constructive critique involving someone's core identity also has the same effect without it being sexist. Like racism, or anti religious, or regional differences, and economic differences. If it does then it's not specifically sexism which causes this response but critique including someone's core identity. I don't know if that is the case, but I think that it would be valuable to know if there is a difference or not.

As an assumption it makes sense that targeting someone's core identity might cause them to experience more feelings of self doubt. Considering that a targeted and personal assault on someone's identity might cause them to doubt themselves."

1519,"Conversely, you can't 'fix humanity', you fix problematic groups one by one. 'Why this group' is a nonsensical question because the only answer you can give is 'why not this group'. Your answer was 'you could start with any other group consisting of humans' and again, the only answer you can give is 'yes but I fell on this group'. If you give any other answer you will never solve anything.

Another angle: outside intervention to a problematic group eventually comes when the group can't self-regulate, either because it's not a close-knit group or because it doesn't have a central leadership managing members. If you want to avoid collective measures on a group you have to divide it up and make sure your regional variant has no problematic members. So they can disband the Furry Club of South Florida for consisting mainly of pedophiles and you'd see no effect on yours half the country away. You might get an investigation but that's it."

Full abstract:

Religious people live longer than nonreligious people, according to a staple of social science research. Yet, are those longevity benefits an inherent feature of religiosity? To find out, we coded gravestone inscriptions and imagery to assess the religiosity and longevity of 6,400 deceased people from religious and nonreligious U.S. counties. We show that in religious cultural contexts, religious people lived 2.2 years longer than did nonreligious people. In nonreligious cultural contexts, however, religiosity conferred no such longevity benefits. Evidently, a longer life is not an inherent feature of religiosity. Instead, religious people only live longer in religious cultural contexts where religiosity is valued. Our study answers a fundamental question on the nature of religiosity and showcases the scientific potential of gravestone analyses."
1541,"Just a theory, but suppose there is something to this. Judaism and Christianity touch on the prospect of sacrificing. Sacrifice is the act of ignoring impulsive pleasure in order to enjoy a more plentiful reward in the future. This concept alone is enough for me to see how religion could have a positive impact on the longevity of people lives."
1542,"Are these ridiculous research projects, clearly designed to bolster a political agenda with ""scientific"" evidence, being funded by taxpayers' money??"
1543,I feel like I had a stroke reading this title
1544,"You know, the Christians who lived in pagan Rome didn't live as long as the Romans, either... on account of being discriminated against, treated brutally and genocidically killed off in the arenas. If there's any validity to your study, it demonstrates the effect of discrimination on lifespans."
1545,"the religious live longer only in the sense that we live longer when we're a part of a group, it gives us companionship, reasons to get out and get some fresh air and exercise, its a fact we live longer when were happier, have less stress and feel loved. pet owners live longer than non pet owners. married people live longer than single people, we're a social species."

1558,"I have a huge issue with this work. From the methods section of this article:

>We analyzed the association between religiosity and longevity based on large-scale gravestone data. Our study focused on Christians (vs. nonbelievers) in the United States—the denomination and country that is typically studied in religiosity research. We set up an a priori sampling strategy (see Sampling and Coding Description in the online supplemental materials) to select which areas and graves to include in our analyses. In short, we collected data from a sample of 6,400 deceased people from 64 U.S. counties. To do so, we relied on publicly available information from the U.S. religion census and the Internet archive findagrave.com.   
>  
>First, we used the U.S. religion census to calculate the share of Christians (i.e., cumulated share of Catholics and Protestants) within counties. Based on this county religiosity measure, we stratified the sampling of the 64 counties so that 50% represented religious cultural contexts (i.e., high share of Christians) and 50% nonreligious cultural contexts (i.e., low share of Christians). In each cultural context (i.e., religious and nonreligious), 50% of the counties were urban (i.e., inside metropolitan areas) and 50% were rural (i.e., outside metropolitan areas).

Can someone shed some more light on this? It seems that they're defining 'nonbeliever' as 'non-Christian', which seems intuitively like a massive stretch. They don't provide any additional detail on the religious makeup of those counties... I doubt that anyone would define a county that was, e.g. 33% Christian, 33% Jewish, and 33% Muslim as 'nonbelievers', though it would come out as such using this classification method.

The supplemental materials do not provide any additional detail on this step. So really this article is 'christian' vs 'non-christian' at best."
1559,"Hey my psychology professor studies this!

Dr. David Speed."
1560,It's not about what you believe.  It's how high your community status.
1561,"You're looking at the dead, not the living. Those who are Raptured will never be buried."
1562,"That having been said, the years I spent in a Yahoo chat about religion, where atheists wore their disfaith like a badge of honor while putting Christians down the whole time I was there, three of the atheists committed suicide, while no Christians died."
1563,"So all religions are the same.

Some sacrifice their children others wont slaughter a cow.

Yeah let’s just call everyone the same though cause it makes the math easier."
1564,What even does this mean?
1565,I work in palliative care and what's more interesting is how religious people feel closer to death. The fear of nothing cant be brushed under the carpet any longer.
1566,I didn't even know there are people who think a person lives longer if they're religious. Now I know.
1567,"It doesn't measure their religiosity, it measures their stature in a community. I'd totally believe that people better integrated in their community live longer for a multitude of secular reasons."
1568,Study finds that people who are part of a group only get the benefits of being part of a group when they're part of the group.
1569,"""People who profess they follow societal norms, and appear to do so, are more likely to live longer in the relevant society than those who don't, especially where such a division may be linked to violence or access to resources."""
1570,"We need a well-thought our experiment with thousands of parents volunteering, with half of their kids raised religiously and half raised as atheists. Random selection. After another 100 years we can follow the differences between the two groups. 

My guess is that it would be difficult to find religious people who, for the sake of science, will turn their own children into atheists even if it led to a better life with more happiness and longevity."
1571,"I would argue that devoutly religious people will not put in as much effort to live longer, because they have somewhere they *know* they will go, and it’s somewhere they want to go to (i.e. heaven). An atheist, on the other hand, would assume that this life is all they’ve got, and so would devote more time to health and medicine and science to extend their life as long as possible. 

Obviously this doesn’t hold true for *everyone* in *all* groups, but it’s a thought."
1572,I wrote a paper years ago on religiosity and happiness. Non religious people are as happy or happier than religious people
1573,I’d be interested to see how the other noted benefits of religious observance hold up in a secular society. Does prayer convey the same placebo benefit? How do the marriages hold up? Ect.
1574,Is this even a thing. Who thinks that religion extends life? This is About as likely as the Bible being real.
1575,TIL there was a remnant pseudoscience connecting religion to longevity that was still somewhat widely accepted.
1576,"AKA the religion of peace, if everyone is in the same religion."
1577,"Religion is retarded, literally."

1582,"Are you telling me that ""religiosity"" is a word?"
1583,Or where vaccines and modern medicine are available
1584,Is this the ELI5 one? I can't figure out what the title wants to tell me.
1585,Or those that are a member of a community live longer due to the tangible/intangible benefits of being a member or said community.
1586,Cultural conformity is adaptive I guess.
1587,Or having purpose and community leads to a longer life. This has been the results of many studies. I suspect this even carries to having a pet.
1588,Or people who know how to maximize their position in any given society live longer.
1589,"Are you counting atheists as ""those ostracized from a community""?  Because I believe the study implies that religious people have longer average lifespan than non religious people, and the difference comes from atheists not participating in a culturally homogenous enviroment with peers."
1590,support systems valued in religion extend lives?
1591,"I think ots that it you belong to an in group you're life span can be longer, not sure how it would translate to the reverse"
1592,It means those at the top of a pyramid scheme unsurprisingly live like kings at the expense of everyone else.
1593,"That's exactly what I thought. I bet in non-religious societies everyone have equal, and probably higher expected lifespans."
1594,"Herd-oriented people like cultists, patriots and sports fans need herds."
1595,Ha. Allot of non-religious people relate to this comment.
1596,Does this mean that the Uhigurs in Chinese concentration camps cant rely on their religiosity to give them a longer life?
1597,"Community is absolutely.  It also why religious people tend to be happier in similar studies.  

It’s not necessarily the religious, it’s the community and sense of belonging.  

I really think it’s something missing in the modern Western world."

1608,Amazing that we’re looking at this like it’s solid data. Pathetic in reality
1609,Thank you for clarifying.
1610,"But if it was purely a result of being part of the cultural norm you should see non-religious people in non-religions cultures living longer. So it is a combination of both being religious and in a religious culture to gain the benefit.  In that sense it seems fair to say being religious is linked to longer life the same way owning a car allows you to get places faster, even though technically you must own a car and live in a culture that has roads in order to realize the benefit of having a car."
1611,"'Course, then the empire that city ran ended up collapsing after Christianity took over, and research showed the water they all drank was contaminated with lead because of the plumbing, damaging their brains, so... living underground, the Christians weren't living off the public works but drawing from wells.

1620,"This study is silly because it doesn't actually measure a person's religiosity. It analyzed people's religiosity based on their gravestone... that's not a measure of their religiosity, that's a measure of their family's religiosity if anything (assuming that the deceased didn't pick their own stone, of course). And perhaps a measure of the gravestones' cost; if a simple cross is cheaper than an ornate stone in less religious counties, whereas a carved angel is more expensive in the religious counties, there might be economic reasons to choose one stone over the other.

TLDR interesting abstract but they should probably repeat the study in a longitudinal fashion, aka assess people's religious beliefs before they're dead."
1621,A chimpanzee will live longer in the chimpanzee enclosure than it will in the lion enclosure.
1622,The effect of belief extending has only shown a significant increase when the person was in a group that valued the belief. So a person with strong religious belief in a community of people that also have a strong religious belief may live longer than a person with strong religious belief living in a community that doesn't have a strong religious belief.
1623,Believing in god only makes you live longer if people around you care about god
1624,The methods of the article actually show that they're only considering christians in their religiosity assessment. All non-Christian religions are grouped with Atheists in the 'nonbeliever' category from what I can tell.

1633,Not necessarily. It has been my experience that non-religious people are more ostracized in religious communities than religious people in non-religious communities. If that is correct it could explain the pattern in the data.
1634,My assumption would be that it representation more to being in a close-knit community than religiosity.  It doesn't seem like they controlled for this; and the fact that a correlation was only found relative to communities in which religiosity was held in high regard suggests the factor may have nothing to do with religiosity and more the support and well-being a tight social structure provides.
1635,"Considering that the only contemporary cultures I can think of that have classified themselves specifically ""non-religious"" tended to also have breadlines and mass executions, probably not as great."

Thinking you're gonna get a new, perfect body after you die makes you less likely to take care of the one you have, or so my theory goes."

1642,"Garbage study that reinforces Reddit’s prevailing narrative?  
Straight to the top of r/science"
1643,"My thoughts exactly.

Studies like this also have some difficulty accounting for some groups, especially oppressed and/or minority religions. The availability and cost of an unusual grave marker, deliberate exclusion from mainstream society, and/or fear of the grave being desecrated could all prevent those people from wanting to express their beliefs post-mortem. There are also religions that don't use any practical symbols like that, and religious communities that just don't prioritize the expression of their beliefs on graves. Not to mention all the symbols that are co-opted by both religious *and* secular communities, like lambs, doves, lotuses, etc.

There are just too many ""what about x?"" questions for a study like this. I've done a few cemetery seriation projects as an archaeologist, often involving the study of symbols, phrases, and designs on grave markers; I've even focused on  religious iconography, specifically. But those studies can only really examine the graves themselves, and any conclusions about the decedent have to be tentative. I certainly wouldn't be making such broad assertions about their personal beliefs (nor the *depth* of those beliefs) prior to burial, unless I had actually met them or had at least conducted more in-depth research on their life."
1644,"But that might impair the mission of creating a study to reinforce a previously determined conclusion. 

On a separate tangent, religiosity also tends to stress rejection of tobacco, alcohol and irresponsible lifestyles all of which tend to curtail lifespans."
1645,"Yup, correlation doesn't imply causation. The investigation, as the abstract states (I'd have to look at the paper for see how the hell they reach these conclusions) only proves that in a religious setting/context tombstone's amount of religious imagery/allusion is proportionally correlated to the length of the life on that tombstone.

It could also be that people that lived a longer life were more grateful about it, and in a religious society that gratefulness would be directed towards religion. While those that lived a short lifespan, or even a very short one, would probably (or at least their families) feel abandoned by their religion or against it, so they'd use less symbols and such.

Or it could be something else entirely were neither causes each other. Such as richer people generally living longer, and also spending more on getting religious allusion on their tombstones."
1646,"You hit the nail on the head. ""Religiosity"" is a subjective determination much less in a society with multifactorial implications. Would that be judged by the lack of crime, the adherence to religious laws or by the possible increase in crimes associated with religions?

Also looking at gravestones and screening for religion is superficial when the more obvious questions related to health are cryptic. 

For example they Should screen for know mortality causes such a as ""smoking or non"" before secondarily screening for religion."
1647,Then there's cultures in India who only cremate their dead or lets say natives cultures who do not use 'gravestones'. It would've been more honest to say that religions that follow Abrahamic beliefs fall into this criteria.
1648,"This actually makes a lot of sense. If they have a religious gravestone, their family members probably prayed for them, which one would expect to have the effect of God letting people live a little bit longer. Naturally, God wants to give people an incentive to pray, and a slightly longer life for people whose families are religious is a pretty small concession on His part.

It’s so obvious that the study is worthless unless they slice the data by religion and maybe ethnicity too, just to use it as a control. Science could actually determine which religion’s believers have the strongest prayer powers, providing support for the truth claims of one religion over another. I’m really tired of wondering which of all the religions is the true word of God."

1664,"This is EXACTLY what I was thinking (correlation / causation). How do we know having a longer life didn’t make them religious. They’re old, their friends die, and maybe their friends visit them from hell to warn them. As a scientist you need to be careful assuming the direction of causality."

1667,"I can’t pretend to know for certain of course, but something like Jungian archetypes or just pure coincidence would seem more likely than a real global flood to me, since most cultures *don’t have a global flood myth* and regular floods were known to almost every culture. An actual global flood anything like the myths is ruled out by geology anyway, unless you’re a young-Earth creationist in which case I won’t bother arguing evidence with you. I personally do think a catastrophic regional flood *was* likely an inspiration for the specific Ancient Near Eastern flood myth though."

It's convincing when the alternative is that almost all the Earth's land was submerged in water at some point in geologically recent history but that there's no evidence whatsoever for this. Even local floods leave telltale geological signs. I'm not saying it's definitely a coincidence, but I'm saying that's one of a few likely hypotheses and that an actual global flood is impossible. It being a pure coincidence doesn't particularly make sense, but neither does quantum mechanics and that doesn't make tiny elves moving subatomic particles the most likely explanation."

I found a handful of articles linking religious service attendance to better self reported health https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027795360900392X but that article might be weak because people who are ill might not be physically able to attend services. I also saw an article on Bulgarians  https://www.oeaw.ac.at/fileadmin/subsites/Institute/VID/PDF/Publications/Working_Papers/WP2015_08.pdf saying that Protestants, Muslims, Jews,""other religion,"" and people of no religion had longer than average lifespans, while people who were Roman Catholic had shorter than average lifespans; people of no religion had more deaths by suicide. The Muslims had the longest lifespan; they thought it was because they don't drink alcohol."
1688,">Citation? This seems like a total lie since being on the spectrum should have nothing to do with the home you were raised in and your trust for the scientific method.

The scientific method doesn't allow you to ask for a citation and then proceed to debunk it before you have even investigated it. Also newsflash people can be religious and practice reliable science, it's not an either/or scenario.  

Why should it seem to offend you if atheism is linked to autism? Examine your biases. 

In my field I have access to pubmed and cognitive psych, I suggest you pay for the journals or for online access like I did and look it up yourself. There is an established link between autism and atheism. 

there are 102 genes currently thought to link to autism so if there is a link between autism/atheism then it is likely derived from that genetic predilection before any pretense of ""rationality"" or ""free will"" by the atheist themselves. 

Likewise it's neither an insult nor a compliment to say religious people use ""creative intelligence"" as this could also be phrased as they are more comfortable using their imagination (as atheist's say ""Making Sh$% up""). 

This tendency has also been shown to have a genetic link.  Thus in both cases where genetic predisposition to use the imagination affects one's ability to believe or disbelieve in God then there is a causal link. 

Before you start I am not a religious person."

1696,"I agree that it was pretty difficult to read!

Essentially - and this is the dumbed-down version as I interpreted it, with some help - fMRI imaging suggests that those who have CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a debilitating illness that, as of yet, has no known biomarker for diagnosis) experience significant increased activity in certain parts of the brain that initiate cognitive hypersensitivity - essentially indicating problems with sensory pain processing and internal sensation awareness. 

Most dumbed-down version: Exercise bad. For those without CFS, exercise good.

This is important because CFS is a historically under-researched and often belittled illness. If scientists are able to find a diagnostic tool to corroborate patients' disabling symptoms, it will give hope to the millions of people whose lives have been destroyed by this disease."

1705,"Human beings altered one of the highest peaks in the Himalayas hundreds of years before a person ever set foot there, new research has found.

The study, publishing today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, indicates that the byproducts of burning coal in Europe in the late 18th century made their way to the Dasuopu glacier in the central Himalayas, some 6,400 miles as the crow flies from London, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution.

“The Industrial Revolution was a revolution in the use of energy,” said Paolo Gabrielli, lead author of the study and a principal investigator and research scientist at The Ohio State University Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center and the School of Earth Sciences.

“And so the use of coal combustion also started to cause emissions that we think were transported by winds up to the Himalayas.”

The research team that published this study was part of a larger international team that traveled to Dasuopu in 1997 to drill ice cores from the glacier. The cores provide a record of snowfall, atmospheric circulation and other environmental changes over time; the Byrd Center has one of the largest collections of ice cores in the world.

Dasuopu — at 7,200 meters or 23,600 feet above sea level — is the highest-altitude site in the world where scientists have obtained a climate record from an ice core. Dasuopu is located on Shishapangma, one of the world’s 14 tallest mountains, which are all located in the Himalayas.

1713,So global warming is England’s fault? Why aren’t they being punished for this crime? Only the US gets dragged in the mud as if we are literally North Korea
1714,Yup. Widely regarded as Manchester.  First factory was actually In Cromford (Derbyshire)
1715,"It depends on how you define the Industrial Revolution. ;)

By most metrics the Industrial Revolution is marked by smelting of iron ore using coke from coal. This was first done in 1709 at Coalbrookedale, Shropshire in the Midlands. 

If it refers to factory production then it was the silk mill at Derby constructed by John Lombe in 1721 - although this was initially water-powered.

If it is steam power, although Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine had been chugging away since 1712 in Devon, it was James Watt's engine that really got things started in the 1760s and it was William Murdoch and Richard Trevithick down in Cornwall who turned it into a powerhouse from the 1770s onward."
1716,"I think technically the Midlands, (Derwent valley, Black Country) before migrating North for economic reasons."
1717,"Futhermore, each barrel of fossil fuels has a distinct isotopic profile, so each layer of snow, ice, thaw, and freeze contains every single summer and winter worth of particles that gives us information on what happened in the atmosphere."
1718,">  A big fear with permafrost melting is letting out things that haven’t been loose in air for thousands and millions of years.

Just because ice melts doesn't catapult those materials into the atmosphere. The melt water will transport it into rivers and then oceans where it will disperse and go back to nature were it came from. It's all a closed cycle. No need to panic."

When population density is high, finding females is easy but there is a risk that she's promiscuous and the male might find more than one female; bigger testicles are useful here.  Researches could try studying low and high density islands."
1772,Could this be an example of punctuated equilibrium within the Theory of Evolution?
1773,"I am skeptical of this sentence: ""Instead, the mongooses invested in sperm factories to meet the new challenge of competing against a torrent of other males’ sperm.""

The researchers did not actually measure sperm count or motility. They measured the exterior dimensions of the testes, which is not the same thing. It is possible that while testes size increased, sperm count and motility dropped. This often tends to happen among mammals following the type of population bottleneck and inbreeding that tends to be involved with the founding of an invasive population on an island."

1808,So essentially musk glands.
1809,"So why are the mongooses developing larger testes but smaller anal pads?

You need larger testes to produce more sperm, right? So if you and some other guys are all mating with the same female during her estrous, then you need more sperm to have a better chance of making sure you're the father of one or more of the pups in her litter

But then why develop smaller anal pads? That scent is important for attracting females and repelling the other males during the breeding season, right?"

1833,It has nothing to do with climate changes.
1834,Is anything like this potentially possible for humans? (For example we have an ice age and our testes go up over a quick period of time)
1835,[removed]
1836,There are no factors that seem to be limiting humans ability to reproduce.  Without this I doubt we will change as a species in any direction.
1837,"It might be easier to think of the interaction of the environment with the organism when thinking about its evolution. There is always a interaction between the ecology of a species and its evolution, and in a lot of cases their ecology is what drives their evolution.

Sample size is an important feature of these sorts of questions because an incomplete sampling can bias your interpretation (imagine sampling only mongooses on islands, instead of including the paper's original comparison of native mainland mongooses to island ones).

For humans, these same factors are relevant. Human ecology is a weird concept, but in a sociocultural lens it might be more clear. The sampling aspect becomes much more important though because with humans, there is a lot of gene flow between populations. Gene flow just means that mating pairs can disrupt the accumulation of environmental adaptations.

In the mongoose example, the sexual traits (anal pads and testes size) are tenable targets of selection because the isolation from mainland populations (where the target of selection is the opposite than on islands, due more male competition) relaxes mainland targets, giving way to change the direction of evolution.

Without isolation, its difficult for evolution to proceed rapidly because it keeps getting mixed into a new genetic background. That's sort of the case in humans, where there may be a large range of different traits, but there's no strong enough selection on any particular range (with height we have a large variance but the particular range might be people taller than 6 feet) to overcome the high degree of gene flow.

That's not to say there aren't human adaptations to the environment though. Melanism, lactose tolerance, high altitude hypoxia tolerance all are sort of classic cases. "
1838,"Species centrism is a tough hurdle for every relevant scientific field to navigate.

That said, anthropologist Alan Walker dedicated his career to studying humans as animals, and wrote books worth reading that address your questions."
1839,"Diet most certainly effects our physiology. Our food industry is kinda fucked up atm, trying to maximise profit and minimise work... The amount of soy that is stuffed into almost every food item in the grocery store is having an accumulative effect on people's bodies... The amount of hormones pumped into animals that become the flesh we eat, its full of steroids and hormones and hormone blockers...

Humans hormones are most certainly being affected by our environment."
1840,"My anal pads are hardly even visible at this point, so you might be on to something.

But seriously, there are certainly correlations between ecology, environment and evolution working on human beings but we don't have a long-distance scent-based or pheromonal mating system to lose in an island setting. Technically speaking scent *does* play some role in human mating habits, but we don't go around engaging in marking behavior as part of a mating strategy. Only around 10% of humans have the vestigial organ in the nose related to detecting pheromones so it doesn't seem to be especially important and probably hasn't been for hundreds of thousands of years or longer."
1841,Yes. We are just hairless taking apes. We could breed superior humans just like we breed superior anything else. Hitler took it too far and now everyone is scared shitless of it. And or their egos can't take it. Nobody wants to be obsolete.
1842,"No. It would be founder's if the mongooses that were originally introduced had these reduced sexual traits. Instead, these introduced mongooses experienced relaxed selection from their native area, and so stopped investing in a trait they no longer needed over time. This paper is looking at about 120 years since their introduction."
1843,"Species in which females commonly have multiple male partners, such as chimpanzees and bonobos, tend to have bigger testicles.  Species prone to monogamy, like gibbons, or in which multiple adult  females tend to mate with a single male, like gorillas, tend to have  lower sperm-competition rates and smaller testicles.

Obviously there are other modes of speciation besides allopatric speciation (geographically isolated populations), but none that required changes in reproduction."
1892,"But that is exactly what is causing these mongooses to change: the removal of their ancestral constraints on reproduction (mostly predators). But humans are harder to study, as we don't have any massive but totally isolated populations that have remained for as many generations as these small mammals."

We know that monogamy is a relatively new trait in humans because (along with other evidence) we have quite large testes. We also know we've been physiologically adapting towards monogamy for some time - this is the leading explanation for some unique-among-primates traits such as concealed ovulation and female sexual ornamentation (i.e. permanently big breasts), as well as (iirc) relatively poor sperm quality.

And of course, humans aren't completely monogamous - few animals are. Nevertheless most people who have children will do so with only one partner, or at any rate, few partners. There are exceptions, of course."

1935,"Current estimates is the sun will last another 5.4 billion years on its hydrogen reserves, at which point it “begins dying” and switch’s too this growing stage. The red-giant stage is what this is describing, and in fact this high luminosity is at the END of the red giant stage as it’s shedding all Iayers. 

6 billion years is within the ballpark of when this will happen. 

Then it’ll become a white dwarf and spends a few trillion years cooling down, accompanied only by the remains of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, as everything else according to this research would be reduced to dust by the outbursts."

Break-ups form a vast asteroid debris field much like the classic arcade game, including fragments which revolve around each other as “double asteroids”
Scientists predict that the Solar System’s asteroid belt will be pulverised by the Sun’s light in 6 billion years
The majority of stars in the universe will become luminous enough to blast surrounding asteroids into successively smaller fragments using their light alone, according to a University of Warwick astronomer.

Electromagnetic radiation from stars at the end of their ‘giant branch’ phase – lasting just a few million years before they collapse into white dwarfs – would be strong enough to spin even distant asteroids at high speed until they tear themselves apart again and again. As a result, even our own asteroid belt will be easily pulverized by our Sun billions of years from now.

The new study from the University of Warwick’s Department of Physics, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, analyses the number of successive break-up events and how quickly this cascade occurs.

The authors have concluded that all but the most distant or smallest asteroids in a system would be disintegrated in a relatively short one million years, leaving behind debris that scientists can find and analyse around dead white dwarf stars. Some of this debris may be in the form of ‘double asteroids’ which revolve around each other while they orbit the Sun.

After main sequence stars like our Sun have burnt all their hydrogen fuel, they then become hundreds of times larger during a ‘giant branch’ phase and increase their luminosity ten-thousand-fold, giving out intense electromagnetic radiation. When that expansion stops, a star sheds its outer layers, leaving behind a dense core known as a white dwarf.

The radiation from the star will be absorbed by orbiting asteroids, redistributed internally and then emitted from a different location, creating an imbalance. This imbalance creates a torque effect that very gradually spins up the asteroid, eventually to break-up speed at one full rotation every 2 hours (the Earth takes almost 24 hours to complete a full rotation). This effect is known as the YORP effect, named after four scientists (Yarkovsky, O'Keefe, Radzievskii, Paddack) who contributed ideas to the concept.

Eventually, this torque will pull the asteroid apart into smaller pieces. The process will then repeat itself in several stages, much like how in the classic arcade game ‘Asteroids’ they break down into smaller and smaller asteroids after each destruction event. The scientists have calculated that in most cases there will be more than ten fission events – or break-ups – before the pieces become too small to be affected.

1940,Our sun isn’t large enough to go supernova.
1941,"Well it will become a red giant then...
Still it won't live 6 billion years from now."
1942,"The part of the study that is important is not the date, it is the luminosity of red giants and how many will obtain given luminosity. From this and models of our own solar system, we can figure out what probability already happened elsewhere.

It doesn't matter if the red giant phrase is 1 billion or 10 billion years from now because it'll still produce a large emission of light several thousand times it's current production. The test it proposes is to look at systems that have already completed their main sequence."
1943,"Science says it'll turn gradually to a red giant in about a billion years.
While expanding it'll have ""eaten"" Mercury and Venus by then and Earth will be a scorched dead hell and will also be gone later.
So to say it will take 6 billion years is just wrong which is my point."
1944,"Did you not understand my point?

1948,"The title is misleading; the virus has six genes that they were able to match to homologs, accounting for about 10% of the genome. This is still interesting and places it far apart from other known viruses."
1949,"When I saw the same story posted [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22276105), people were saying that discovering new viruses like this is incredibly common. So while cool, it probably doesn't mean anything."
1950,Oh no. Its coming from both sides of the world now
1951,Viruses like this are often the only link to shadow ecology and the areas of vastly unresearched soil and sediment bacteria
1952,"There's a lot of genes scientists are yet to identify, but what is special about this is simple life tends to be the easiest to study, meaning we have already mapped the genes of single-cell organisms and generally they all have a lot in common, to find one without known genes is quite frankly alien level rare. But to be fair, Brazil has many mysteries waiting to be discovered."

1981,This is not a single-celled organism. This is a virus.
1982,"Unrelated to viruses but there is a lot more diversity between single cell organisms than between most multicellular life.  We have most certainly not mapped all the genes of all (or most) unicellular life and they are not necessarily easier to study either.  There are a lot of microbes that we aren't even able to grow in a dish.  

What is most exciting about a discovery like this is the differences.  When you find a piece of cellular machinery that has no realtion to mammalian genes, it has potential to be used as a genetic tool.  CRISPR is probably the most notable example.  It is a bacterial defence mechanism against viruses that we found useful for gene editing."

This idea gets posed all the time, but it’s complete nonsense. There’s a zero percent chance this is from another planet. The majority of the virosphere has no cellular homologs. Viruses are discovered all the time with very few *known*(including other viruses) homologs, this just happens to be the one with the least. Knowing that every species on Earth (including bacteria) has at least a dozen different viruses, this is not even close to surprising. There’s *a lot* of genetic diversity out there."

Also short RNA ribozymes seem to be able to replicate on their own when the right building blocks are present. Assuming that aliens are more likely to develop in primordial earth-like conditions (mostly nitrogen and carbon dioxide atmosphere with liquid water), it's possible that RNA/DNA are just the most efficient medium for replicating genetic information in that environment. We might find small structural variations (e.g. more/less/different types of nucleotides), but if we were to discover aliens I wouldn't be surprised if their genetic information was also coded in nucleic acid chains."

That said,  I think it spreads a lot more easily and that there is a pretty good chance it’ll eventually make it to the US through a Superseader like the Britain from Singapore.

2010,"This is a new virus, not one that has been known for years. Coronaviruses in general are nothing new– SARS was a coronavirus. Of course, they're not all the same. The 1918 influenza virus was a monster, while most flus have a low fatality rate. As for this coronavirus, it seems to be less deadly than SARS but a lot more infectious.

The good news is that case fatality rates tend to go down over time. For one thing, we get better at detecting mild cases that, before, we might have thought were merely colds or flus. For another, a parasite that kills its host is bad at staying alive and, typically, this means that, while it certainly can worsen, it is more likely in the long run to evolve to lesser lethality (contrary to Plague, Inc.) over time as less virulent strains win out.

The bad news is that, since this coronavirus is so infectious, this also means it will have more opportunities to mutate, so there is a chance of it becoming something a lot worse than what it is. Right now, it looks like it'll kill fewer people than an average flu season... but these things change. 

It's certainly something the WHO and CDC needs to keep an eye on, but is it something that merits a widespread freakout? No, not really, no more than SARS or MERS or the 2009 swine flu."

With no cytoplasm, organelles, or nuclei, a virus isn’t a cell by definition. Without the ability to maintain homeostasis, or respond to stimulus, or reproduce on their own, or grow — viruses aren’t alive as we define it, the same way a computer virus is not an app, but looks like one if you squint."
2016,"There is a great counter to the replication/ parasite argument. 

Take a malaria parasite, a human and a virus and put them in a box, with nothing else besides themselves. 

They all eventually die, but the human and the malaria cell continue life until they have exhausted their own fuels because they are a self contained functioning system. Yes, even the parasitic malaria cell. The virus however, without the presence of it's host, does nothing. It's inert without an external manipulation in the form of chemical energy or random movement of molecules. Much like any other degrading chemical, it stays there until entropy tears it apart, with no ability to delay or alter it's fate. That is why claiming that they are just parasites, like single celled parasites, is silly IMO."

2042,"There are cases of convergent evolution (ie, different organisms evolving parts that function the same, like wings on a bird and wings on a bat). But for an alien virus to evolve into something that can infect us, we would have to have originated from the same source as that virus.

You see, a virus works by 'hacking' our system into reproducing the virus instead of our own cells (simplified). So to do that it needs to ""know"" quite a few things about how our biology works. Extremely unlikely to downright impossible, given the fact that it's already very unlikely for a virus from another mammal to infect humans (but it does happen, hence HIV and probably the nCov virus).

2082,"I get it. Your analogy doesn’t work here though. First of all, you’re using the example of an *Earth* fish taking on the niche of an extinct *Earth* fish. That already makes the analogy invalid. Secondly, viruses are not like animals. They can’t just “scrape by” by altering their physiology (osmoregulation, thermoregulation, etc.). They have no physiology outside of a cell. These “alien” viruses have likely evolved for thousands of years to infect their alien tree of life. Therefore they have no need to carry “keys” to “open” cells on another planet. In fact, their genomes are so small, they don’t have the room to spare. Even viruses on Earth struggle to infect anything other than their preferred host.

If alien viruses came, they would be unable to enter any cells. They would become inactivated, and we would never find them."
2083,"Yes, all that makes sense, except why were you looking at that particular amoeba in the first place? I'm guessing the virus is rare since it was previously unknown. Surely you don't just peer at random amoeba through a microscope until you see one with a virus attached and then try to genetically identify the virus in case it just happens to be one that is previously unknown? I can't imagine that the research isn't somehow designed to make it more likely to find such things, and that's what I'm wondering about: how do you improve your chances of observing such a rare thing?"
2084,"Ik, my point was that with the 'living', 'non living' debate still going on, calling them microorganisms isn't that much of a mistake. Maybe we could go technical, but that would also mean that we would have to be very proper with all types of viruses when talking about them. For casual convo, microorganisms is a good term."
2085,"Semi-alive state? What does that even mean? You aren't sure if it's a rock or a slug? What's the most basic definition for life? Chemicals react to stimuli without being alive, is amino acid in some primordial ooze alive? Probably not, the conditions for life don't define life. How does the first strand of DNA occur? And does this virus prove there's more than one way? It would have to, if we are unfamiliar with its DNA then clearly it sprung up a different way than usual."
2086,"I like to think of then as ""pathogenic nucleic acids"". As for alive/dead, it helps to compare them to prions, pathogenic proteins that can only replicate by modifying other proteins. Prions are obviously not alive either and viruses behave similarly, though they are slightly more complex with a protein and possible lipid shell."
2087,"Like i said above, with debates regarding their mortality status still going on, using the word microorganisms at least in a casual setting is not that wrong. And calling them parasites would mean you acknowledge them as living, not to mention that a lot of microbes (microsporidia is an example ik) are obligate parasites who need the host's machinery to replicate."

That said some of the larger cities that were/are being effectively shutdown to slow the spread constitute populations of over 30million people... That's a huge undertaking and probably not likely to happen unless Chinese leadership is very worried about this virus."
2093,"Viruses don't actively do any of those things.  It's pretty much chance if they get to their ""target"" tissues.  Not to mention, the ""host"" of a virus can be flexible.  Usually diseases like Ebola come from other animals, like bats, pigs or chickens.  In these animals the virus will cause not much more than what would be a cold to humans, because a virus that creates mild symptoms and spreads without killing its host is the one that survives the longest.  However, in humans, it is capable of becoming extremely pathogenic.  This isn't because it naturally evolved in humans.  It's because they are in the *wrong* host.  They are capable of infecting and reproducing inside of humans too well.  If ebola gave humans the same symptoms as it gives bats, it would be a global pandemic, rather than just a handful of cases, as the people infected actually are able to move around and infect others without the whole bleeding out of their eyes giving away that they're sick."
2094,"More akin to a computer virus that infects cells. Where as a single celled bacteria can intake nutrients from its surrounding area and reproduce through ~~mitosis~~ [binary fission](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_fission).

2101,"Parasite does not imply living.

If a corporation is parasitic, it is not alive. In the same way that if a particle of protein and DNA/RNA is parasitic, it is not implied to be alive.

The **philosophical** debate over whether viruses are living or not is completely irrelevant in this discussion. That debate is a fools errand because it is only dependant on what definition of 'alive' used.

We are discussing scientific classification.

Are viruses organisms? By definition, no. Why? They do not consist of cells, the most basic form of an organism.

Are fungi organisms? By definition, yes. Why? They consist of a eukaryotic cell or cells.

The cell is the most basic form of an organism.

If we start calling viruses organisms where exactly do we draw the line? 

Is a PCR reaction an organism? If a virus is an organism, I think it would be okay to call a PCR reaction an organism as well."

2117,"calm down buddy

DNA is just chemicals.  Chemicals which are constituted of atoms which follow the laws of physics.  These interactions can be modeled to a very precise state.  As my job I currently study a protein from a soil bacteria that we analyze at the atomic scale using xray diffraction crystallography.  This means taking a 3d scan of a crystallized form of the protein using x-rays and inputting the diffraction patterns into computer software that is able to make millions of calculations to create a 3d model of the protein to the atomic level.  And on the weekend I work at a dental office.  I'm hoping to get into dental school.

My point is, DNA and its biological functions are well understood, as are many viruses.  To the point where if you study enough and memorize enough, you could theoretically understand a virus and its functions to the atomic scale, to the point where its ""actions"" appear to you as a lined up row of dominos tipped by a finger might.  

More and more interactions are being understood at this scale.  Even in phenomenon such as behavior, which many lay people would think of as self-determined by the organism, are able to be understood in terms of hormones and even genes in the DNA.  For example, genes in humans that determine the structure and number of dopamine receptors influence how likely one is of gaining an uncontrollable addiction.  

I hope you understand now what I mean when I made the comparison to a row of dominos.  Honestly the more science I learn the more I find myself strengthening my deterministic view of the universe."

>**Abstract:** Transition fronts, moving through solids and fluids in the form of propagating domain or phase boundaries, have recently been mimicked at the structural level in bistable architectures. What has been limited to simple one-dimensional (1D) examples is here cast into a blueprint for higher dimensions, demonstrated through 2D experiments and described by a continuum mechanical model that draws inspiration from phase transition theory in crystalline solids. Unlike materials, the presented structural analogs admit precise control of the transition wave’s direction, shape, and velocity through spatially tailoring the underlying periodic network architecture (locally varying the shape or stiffness of the fundamental building blocks, and exploiting interactions of transition fronts with lattice defects such as point defects and free surfaces). The outcome is a predictable and programmable strongly nonlinear metamaterial motion with potential for, for example, propulsion in soft robotics, morphing surfaces, reconfigurable devices, mechanical logic, and controlled energy absorption."

I'm honestly not sure."
2130,"Tyrannosaurus are generally regarded as apex predators, though the scavenger theory does have some weight to it. T-Rex had size and strength on it's size. It could over power almost anything it ran into. However, due to its size and bulk it could not run very fast (contrary to films). The arms arent too big of an issue, only keeps it from climbing and reaching basically, but prey out running it absolutely was an issue."
2131,"Most predators are at least part time scavengers (hyenas, lions, tigers, wolves and bears). But T-Rex was a predator too. They discovered the tip of an adult T-Rex tooth embedded in a herbivore where new growth bone had healed over it. They also discovered T-Rex inflicted bite marks on other herbivore skeletons.

Apparently, T-Rex teeth are positioned so they used a bite and tear chunks of flesh strategy. Considering their height and speed, they could easily chase down and loom over prey, taking chunks out of them until they bled out.

As far as arms are concerned, they haven't 100% identified their use beyond having an unusual ball and socket, so their claws might have faced inwards in a grasping position, similar to our form of clapping. It's theorized that they're either used for mating or for quick tearing motions since they were unusually powerful with two talon like claws on each arm."

2133,"T-rex were almost definitely scavengers, arms being a key point. But also, it is thought, using their bones and footprints, that they couldn't have been that fast and that humans could actually out run them"
2134,Don’t take my word for it. I’m asking because I have no idea. Seems like I ‘Reddit’ somewhere.
2135,"Oh okay. In that case allow me to have a wild guess:

I would say that the T Rex looks tall enough that it could sort of stand over large prey and lean over so that it could reach with it's tiny arms to claw it, but that even without using it's arms it might be able to claw with it's hind legs or just straight up bite something to death."
2136,"Not that it means much, but I saw a documentary a while back about the debate over whether he was a predator or a scavenger (and as I understood most of the modern interpretation points to him being a scavenger). 

The two main points being that of course, his arms are far too short to be useful for attacking anything, so he'd be quite clumsy trying to catch prey bipedally with just his mouth, being so tall. And the other being that you can get a good sense of an animal's top running speed by measuring the bones in it's legs, and apparently the T-Rex's bones point to him being a much slower-moving creature than we originally thought. 

So it's more likely that he merely scavenged on dead creatures since he would have a very hard time catching up to and then killing prey."

___

>**Abstract**

>Advertising by fossil fuel companies is a ubiquitous element of modern political life. Promotional campaigns in the service of a corporation’s position toward environmental issues such as climate change are prevalent in the oil and gas sectors, where corporate image is seen as a valuable asset in managing risk, controlling negative media attention, and overcoming resistance by antagonistic civil society groups. This article assesses advertising expenditures by five major oil and gasoline companies for the time period 1986 to 2015. We examine four major factors that may influence spending on advertising by the oil and gas sectors: (1) the overall reputation of the oil and gas sector; (2) congressional attention to climate change; (3) media attention to climate change; and (4) a series of control variables including major oil spills, the publication of major climate change reports, overall public concern about climate change, GDP, and oil prices. We find that the factors that most influence corporate promotional spending are media coverage and congressional attention to the issue of climate change."
2139,"Your mistake is in believing media is paid to endorse the oil industry, for that they would need to be independent of each other..."
2140,"Your conclusion would mean it is possible to outbid oil companies for advertisement space, I don't think that's the case. Convergence is a new word we hear these days, convergence of tech gives us things like the smart-phone, but what about convergence in terms of economics? If one economic sector prevailed over the other 9 what would it look like? Given civil authorities have no authority beyond civil bounds it wouldn't look any different if the dominant didn't want it to look different, it would look like business as usual, right up until the dominant secured absolute power.

Sadly I'm a Cynic, not a conspiracy theorist, and a Cynic refuses to place unnecessary bets, that's my defining quality as much as people would accuse it of being a hindrance. You fools take way too much on faith..."
2141,"Resource giants have the kind of influence that pressures civil governments into war, all so they can step in afterwards and take the wheel of resource wealth, they will kill thousands just to control a pocket of oil. Where industrialists pull the strings of politicians like that, what chance do you think media has? In fact it is through media those industrialists control politicians, it is through media a candidate is sold to the public."
2142,"One mistake I don't particularly want to make is in judging if killing thousands of people to control resource wealth is justified, maybe it is, but for it to be justified it needs to be in defense of a rule of law civil establishment, this is why don't support it, that same media is undermining the civil establishment, not defending it, so the actions they endorse are criminal, murder, and compared to what they are doing to the civil establishment that's the tip of the iceberg as criminality is concerned.

High Treason is worse than atrocities committed in self-defense, in fact a citizen who kills in self-defense is often acquitted of all wrong-doing if they can establish beyond reasonable doubt their actions were out of their hands, why should a civil establishment be any different? It is responsible for its citizens, so where invasion and control of resource wealth may be justified under certain scenarios, first we would need to establish this is one of those scenarios, it isn't, if it were the civil establishment would be safe, not crumbling.

So while these actions may not be directly to destroy the civil establishment, one thing is certain, it isn't to save it, in fact mass media resentment for civil society is so apparent now they ain't even trying to hide it..."

Soap was disregarded as so few people used it long enough to matter in the various experiments. The bread and butter was people need to completely dry their hands after any level of rinse. So possibly it is the friction in the act of drying, but I don't recall how long hands being scrubbed underneath water having impact."

2316,"The point isn't washing hand after using the toilet, it's increasing people washing their hands in general, before eating, after holding onto dirty escalator handrails that everybody has been touching, after resting your hands on armrests that are not thoroughly cleaned, before or after going through security, etc.

The bathrooms in a lot of airports are full just of people trying to pee (and then wash their hands afterwards). There isn't space for a whole load of other people trying to come in to wash their hands to improve basic cleanliness and help avoid spreading germs.

This should be fixed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: From the article   "" only about 20 percent of people in airports have clean hands — meaning that they have been washed with soap and water, for at least 15 seconds, within the last hour or so. The other 80 percent are potentially contaminating everything they touch with whatever germs they may be carrying, Nicolaides says.  (...)  Improving handwashing at all of the world’s airports to triple that rate, so that 60 percent of travelers to have clean hands at any given time, would have the greatest impact, potentially slowing global disease spread by almost 70 percent""  


The focus is clearly on general handwashing, not just handwashing after using the facilities."

2320,"I work in a hospital, and every major hospital has data on microbe resistence patterns. We've seen lots of antibiotic- and antifungal-resistence (we in particular don't hand out enough antivirals, but antiviral-resistance is well-documented in certain organisms, e.g. HIV), but I've never heard of resistance to alcohol-based hand sanitizers. That said, hand sanitizer isn't effective against every type of virus and bacteria in the first place, so hand-washing is the gold standard to me."
2321,I think this is just going to make people not touch the handrails.
2322,"Of course it's non-scientific. It's anecdotal. Which isn't a dirty word like people think it is. Anecdotal just means testimonial claims about empirical observations (where empirical means sensory. Ie, I saw x, I heard x, I smelled x, etc). And we don't need scientific hogwash for literally everything in life when sometimes anecdotal *is more than good enough*.

For example, my own anecdotal ""observations"" indicate a similar disgusting trend: there are too many men who don't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom. I'm going to trust those observations over an above your complete lack of scientific rebuttal. Ie, posting a scientific paper that might contradict what either unlivedphalanx or myself have *directly observed with our own senses*, and then trying to convince unlivedphalanx and I that we should trust a random scientific paper (that could be talking about a location that provides outlier data) over-and-above our direct observations of the local people in our direct lives.

There are some things science is great for. For immediate and simple things in life, direct empirical observation is itself great.

EDIT: To make a really extreme point about what I'm talking about, and why Scientism is bad/stupid, I don't need a scientific paper to tell me what the price of gasoline is today. I can go look at the price myself."

Very few people in western countries would actually be willing to pay the cost it would take to reduce O&G demand significantly now. The people of China believe the west got to enjoy cheap energy for a century before them so they should be allowed to catch up. Japan doesn't want to be reliant on China given their history as that might compromise Japan's sovereignty yet nuclear proved too unsafe. Africans feel as though the west is rich so they should pay the cost to shift to net 0 GHG Emissions not themselves. The people out west feel as though it was their parents or rich business owners who truly benefited from GHG Emitting energy not themselves as they are burdened with education debt and are among the poorest generation to have lived in the last century relative to their immediate previous generation.

Trying to blame this on some evil billionaire misses the complexity of the issue but your conclusion is right. Invent something better and more profitable than O&G and all of a sudden all the complexities become quite simple. Everyone will develop the better technology."
2344,"You don’t have to be a drinker for your brain to be affected by alcoholism.

A new study shows that just having a parent with an alcohol use disorder affects how your brain transitions between active and resting states – regardless of your own drinking habits.

The study, performed by researchers at Purdue University and the Indiana University School of Medicine, discovered that the brain reconfigures itself between completing a mentally demanding task and resting.

But for the brain of someone with a family history of an alcohol use disorder, this reconfiguration doesn’t happen.

While the missing transition doesn’t seem to affect how well a person performs the mentally demanding task itself, it might be related to larger scale brain functions that give rise to behaviors associated with addiction. In particular, study subjects without this brain process demonstrated greater impatience in waiting for rewards, a behavior associated with addiction.

Findings are published in the journal NeuroImage. The work was led by Enrico Amico, a former Purdue postdoctoral researcher who is now a researcher at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.

How the brain reconfigures between active and resting states is like how a computer closes down a program after you’re finished with it.

2365,"For anyone interested in this, check out ""Spillover"" by David Quammen. An amazing book about zoonotic diseases, how they evolve, and how they infect humans. It's a great read."
2366,"What evolutionary pressures would cause bats to develop ""immune systems that are perpetually primed to mount defenses against viruses"" per the intro of the article?  It's a fine discovery, but why bats? Is this due to their communal living in environments where they shower feces on each other? Something about viruses in insects or exposure to a variety of environments due to their ability to fly?"
2367,"It’s interesting, watching nature trying to fight the infection that is an out of control humanity."
2368,It's like we're harming the earth then nature just slowly corrects the problem to survive by eliminating humans
2369,"The novel coronavirus is a cause for concern but it has an undetermined mortality rate. I can’t emphasize this enough. Public is taking news at face value and honestly it’s not false but there are things people should be aware of. 

The numbers are skewed. The death counts might be high but the number of those infected may be even higher. If we’re wondering if this epidemic is more dangerous than other diseases and we’re basing it on deaths, then we should consider *death rates* and not death counts per se. As the transmissibility increases so too does number of cases and naturally more death counts to arise. 

Other diseases kill more people each year in each country more so than this epidemic. The flu alone kills 10000+ people in the US EACH YEAR.

Panic and disorder leads to spreading the disease. Think about it. You don’t have the flu but you are anxious and fear that you do have the flu. You decide to take a trip to the hospital instead of taking OTC. Hospital actually has flu patients. You come now you get it. Not to mention this panicking has led to shortage on face masks for the hospitals since everyone is buying one even though they don’t need it.

Being informed is good but please remain calm and rational."

2376,"I expect this comment to be deleted because I can't find the source.

I remember reading somewhere that the bat's immune system was remarkably accommodating of viruses. For example, no inflammation response which is what the human immune system does in response to infections. 

Now this study says that the immune system is fierce. Are they saying different things or is this study confirming the previous one in a different aspect."
2377,Bats did nothing wrong.
2378,"Though it may seem a bit dark in this context, there is something quite elegant about the way the world responds to imbalance."
2379,"I read this and think positive. We need to protect these animals. We should build more homes for these animals, including in our backyards to help reduce stress. If they have such strong immune systems then we should be studying them far more.

But on the other hand I can picture what the overwhelming number of morons would think...KILL THE DISEASE RIDDEN VERMIN.

On a side note. Bats can eat up to 6000 to 8000 insects a night. Also they are dying off rapidly due to a fungus, it's called white nose syndrome. Its spreading rapidly across the US."
2380,Using them to make soups seems like a marvelous idea at this point
2381,"Fun fact: bats, together with humans, apes, guinea pigs and some birds, are the only mammals that cannot synthesize their own vitamin C.

A typical goat produce 13 grams of vitamin C.

After reading Linus Pauling (2 times Nobel winner) and some fringe doctors like Kenner and Cathcart, I'm more than convinced that very high doses of Vitamin C may help preventing the spread of a viral infection in the body.

Just test it for yourself: if you have some infections, load vitamin C with 1-4g every hour up to bowel tolerance, which increases dramatically. A healthy man could have soft stools after 2 grams only, which is the maximum daily amount for most agencies. You can take dozen times that without problems if you're sick.
Be aware of your iron and water intake levels before trying."
2382,"From a human perspective, I wonder if this could explain the origins of bats carrying vampirism in antiquity and fear of bats. Very interesting."
2383,Torturing them in cages and cooking them alive probably also causes them stress

2398,"For the people who don't know, there was a Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, India last year. Nipah is also transmitted through fruit-eating bats and is much more dangerous than n-Cov. The mortality rate of Nipah is 75%, while of coronavirus is only 2-3%. Nipah also starts as a flue but will have a rapid transition to seizures and comma in a few hours.  and also as you would have guessed there is no vaccine or cure and it is also transmitted by air. There is no option other than complete isolation. luckily due to really good governance, the outbreaks in the past have been contained.

2447,"A terrible one

Bats live in what could be considered a state of perpetual fever, as the act of flying overheats their bodies. This has led to an evolutionary arms-race between Bats and their diseases, thus, any pathogen which infects Bats is sure to be resistant to high body temperatures

2460,Indonesians eat far more bats than Chinese. They just don't have the medical infrastructure to detect the outbreaks and neither do they have the transport infrastructure to rapidly spread viruses.

The viral sequences, most researchers say, also knock down the idea the pathogen came from a virology institute in Wuhan.""

Sampling the market's environment (a densely packed population and area where a virus could spread) does not mean it originated there.

2558,"Heat starts to kill most living things pretty quickly by denaturing proteins. The shape of a protein is essential to its function, and even relatively modest changes can make them less effective or ineffective. There are thermophilic simple organisms, but the more heat resistant an organism, generally the less effective it is at lower temperatures.

&#x200B;

As is, very high fevers are more or less a sudden death round that either kill a human host or the invading organisms."
2559,"Not really: Anything above zero is no problem for a virus (it can survive intact, and simply wait for warmer conditions) , and anything above about 39 starts to become problematic, becoming more and more adverse as the temperature rises above that, until about 121 degrees, at which temperature pretty much no virus can survive.

If you're used to imperial units, use the following reference:

 * 0 degrees = freezing point of water
 * 37.5 degrees = human body temperature
 * 100 degrees = boiling point of water"
2560,"While some viruses *do* mind such tiny changes, since all it takes is one keystone protein misfolding to break the lifecycle of the Virus, (Rabies being the prime example), there's so many Viruses that it's impossible to generalize

It's important to note that strict parasites such as Viruses rely on their host to spread, thus, they will naturally adapt to their host's optimal living conditions, in our case being ~36-37 ºC (98-100 ºF).

Remember also that killing the host is not a good way for a parasite to survive, parasites have not evolved to kill their hosts, they have evolved to spread, and they spread better by not being noticed. 

Our fever is the ""Alarm"" that sounds during a robbery. Our body does not properly work and our immune system is actively developing antibodies to fight back. Any Virus that adapts and survives in those conditions is headed to exctinction, as all it's hosts eventually die/are outcompeted by healthy individuals, and the Virus dies with them"

2579,Less virus or every virus they have? Like any other decomposing corpse
2580,In fairness something worse would come to take their place. Nature abhors a vacuum. And you wonder why nature is fighting back with attitudes like yours.

>Also, humans share a 99% similarity in DNA genome to humans, but I wouldn't say they're super identical.

You mean bats share 99% genome simlarity with humans , right?"
2582,Ah a man of culture
2583,Source? It seems incredible that an animal that can't hover/change directions quickly would be able to consume mosquitoes at such a rate.
2584,Well I can't imagine they are much worse than rodents as disease vectors at least.
2585,Thank you for your sacrifice
2586,That’s entirely assuming our diseases are the same as theirs. Our diseases are specialised because of coevolution. Their diseases might just consume everything in their path.

I don't know about this one. I've read that the slightly lower body temperature of opossums (35C) is thought to inhibit the rabies virus and makes it difficult to survive in them. 

In that regard, it seems that the rabies virus would have *a lot* of problems with temperatures from 0-35."
2592,"Again you are spreading misinformation.  Virus’s are not parasites; they cannot metabolize anything or reproduce on their own.  You have no idea what you’re talking about.i.

2598,"Just 10 days ago the number of recovered was the same as the number of dead, now this number is 4 time as high and the difference will be getting stronger. We're still in the beginning of an infection and there are thousands of recovered. Scientific papers show the true mortality rate at even lower at 1%, with 80% of cases having mild symptoms similar to flu or cold. It's just the Hubei with overwhelmed hospitals that struggle to give the proper care that has higher %"

2605,How about incentivizing lower birth rates or subsidizing birth control or sterilization?
2606,Is growth rate based on total population? So even if we're lower now I'd think more people are still being born than before.
2607,Yeah but mortality rate is decreasing as well.
2608,The Catholic belief I may be wrong here but are they not for normal means of any contraception except for abstinence? But seems I remember a few years ago about some issue and using birth control. Honestly cannot recall for sure.

2612,Yes. Something worse would take their place. The billions and billions of insects the bats eat. Including mosquitos and crop damaging insects.
2613,"> In fairness something worse would come to take their place

Or not.  Something will fill the niche.  whether its ""worse"" is probably a coin flip."
2614,It’s a reference...oh never mind
2615,Bahahaha!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
2616,Lower than bats too.
2617,I thought hippies were higher than anyone else?
2618,"Good point: I was using the term ""no problem"" in the context of whether or not the virus can survive, not in the context of whether it can be active and reproduce.

I've added a sentence in brackets to correct that incorrect implication."

2624,"It's pretty complicated stuff. Eugenics is also kind of an old-fashioned approach.  I think we'll ultimately have to figure out how to change (engineer) characteristics rather than breed them. The mutation for tetrachromacy for example is never going to be breed into a population of billions. 

Either way our skills and understanding are still far too immature at present to be used in any large scale way."
2625,"Very easy for individuals to take a visceral approach to the word eugenics and always always conflate it with it's horrific applications.

Edit: I'm not trying to say eugenics as we have seen it is okay, and I'm not ignoring that as a whole eugenics is problematic to say the least. I was only speaking to people's reaction to the word eugenics because of its history."
2626,They used to do that in India. What happened is that poor families that already had 10 kids got sterilised to cash the financial benefits.
2627,The statistics I looked at were births per 1000 of the population.
2628,Mortality rate is and always has been >99.9%.
2629,"You’re right that many Catholics are taught that childbirth is in the hands of god alone and that man-made contraception is considered opposed to those teachings. But many Catholics also disregard those teachings in favor of a common sense approach to family planning. 

I would wager that an improved understanding of family planning across the country is more responsible than the drop in religious people."
2630,"no worries, china is a problematic situation to wrap your head around sometimes."
2631,No. Just some malicious virus. But good luck with that.

2636,"\> Either way our skills and understanding are still far too immature at present to be used in any large scale way. 

Nope. We are at the stage where human genetic engineering is not only possible but trivial. My own research lab could trivially perform on a human embryo what is regularly done hundreds of times a year on mouse embryos. Trust me, the only thing that is holding this back is politics and ethics. Technologically, we have been there since about 2007.

Also, eugenics never was about breeding, it was always about introduction of desirable inherited characteristics. Just that breeding was the only way to make it happen back in the day when the concept of eugenics originated. Saying Eugenics was about breeding is like saying telephone calls were about cables. They never were, cables were the only way to do it then, but it was always about communication."
2637,Very easy for individuals to conflate words with its meanings? Sure
2638,"I mean, if they were otherwise going to have 5 more, that seems like a win?

The bigger ""social justice"" problem is that poor people (who tend to be minorities, disenfranchised, etc) will always have a greater incentive to take a financial benefit from sterilization. It's not the middle class factory worker in Ohio getting tubes snipped for $100, it's the desperate crack addict on the streets of Baltimore. Same reason many places make selling your own blood and organs illegal."
2639,"Mortality rate is and always has been relative to population and time, i.e. 6 per 1000 annually."
2640,"In the developed countries yes people are being more open to doing more to prevent unplanned pregnancy, the underdeveloped not so much. 
They seem to fall towards the older beliefs.

I have wondered sometimes about such things and in my thinking it seems this belief or teaching may have been implemented by man more so than the words of God. Simply for the fact of one figuring that a baby born into a Catholic upbringing has a very good chance of being a Catholic follower, that in turn with these particular beliefs would then create more members of the same belief, in turn more money into the church....

I just read the other day that the Mormon church just surpassed the 100 billion dollar amount in wealth.....another Church that promotes a bit of parallel teaching as far as contraceptives and such. Sadly it seems that money and power have also gotten into the religious values."
2641,Probably via mosquitoes or other insects.
2642,Why?  What mechanism would make bats better than any alternative for nocturnal insect predator?
2643,"Yeah, feels pretty bad..."
2644,"What’s ironic is that in this specific instance capitalism probably is the best system to deal with unnecessary waste of resources. Thrown out food and unused goods represent a loss for both the customer and the business, meaning both sides are incentivized to use their resourcea as efficiently as possible.

For a counter example look at what happened to the quota system in the Soviet Union. When low usage of resources was rewarded with less allocated resources “ businesses “ were incentivized to use more to receive more.

That’s not to say capitalism is without its faults though, look at healthcare, insurance etc.."
2645,Easy with the rational thought there buddy.  That's dangerous talk round these here parts.
2646,"Are you saying that you could repair autism, provide tetrachromy, change eye colour, produce undamaged human clones and more? Or are you talking about minor procedures?  

It seems to me that we don't even understand the genome properly yet (mapping =/= understanding). We've only just started studying how the interaction between mRNA and DNA effects expression. 

Btw - I would be interested in hearing what we can do."
2647,"The eradication of downs syndrome in Iceland by selective abortion is textbook eugenics, but how often do you see protests against it?"
2648,I don't understand. I'm agreeing with the person that I replied to. Eugenics didn't have to be applied the way that it was. It seems the person I replied to gave an example.
2649,I was only kidding. But fr mortality rate isn’t relevant because as the user above you stated the population increase rate has been decreasing steadily for a century.
2650,Exactly. Something else developed in China no doubt
2651,Bats eat tons of mosquitos. Mosquitos carry tons of disease.
2652,"Autism is a multiple spectrum disorder. We don't know what goes wrong in autism so since we dont know what to fix, we can't fix it yet.

Provide tetrachomacy - Yes.

Change eye-color  - Yes (level of difficulty differs depending on genetic background and desired color)

Undamaged human clones - Yes (already done illegally at least once in China/S.Korea)

But still, most of the things you mentioned are fairly cosmetic. I don't know what you call a minor procedure. It's actually the same procedure whether you want to do something small or something major.

Things that people have seriously explored possibilities of in humans:

1. Somatotropin overexpression to obtain 3-4 x higher muscular strength. You want to get the required DNA to do anything with hormones? Here you go [https://www.scbt.com/browse/Growth-Hormone-CRISPR-Plasmids/\_/N-yrb65v](https://www.scbt.com/browse/Growth-Hormone-CRISPR-Plasmids/_/N-yrb65v) . Buy the kit for about 2500 $.
2. Replace dystrophin for DMD - same process
3. Replace AD, Wilson's disease for the liver etc.

I am getting bored here writing a list so let me put it this way -  there are at least about 10,000 SNP based pathologies and characteristics in humans. ALL of these are modifiable as of today.

The caveat ? Human embryos and their gestation needs to be arranged. Also, you will lose a few of the embryos (for mice, you start with 5 and expect about 2 to complete term, but no one cares because mice have litters of upto 10 at once. As long as you get 1 male and  1 female with your modifications, you are happy because you can then just conventionally breed the modified strain).

&#x200B;

The thing is in its ""infancy"" only for its widespread use due to purely social, political, ethical reasons. It is not in its infancy technologically or economically.

A good analogy is space travel and orbital tourism - no widespread use due to significant economic and logistic requirements. Not because we don't know how to put people in orbit."
2653,Crisper cas-9. Human embryos have been been altered and brought to birth in china.
2654,all the time
2655,Exactly
