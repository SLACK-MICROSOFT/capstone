3,Just published: KEYS to BITCOIN,1,e5rvv9,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e5rvv9/just_published_keys_to_bitcoin/,0,"Hi everyone,

I just published my ebook on Amazon, ""[KEYS to BITCOIN](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0829D91VX)"", so yeah, I am very excited!

But seriously, this is the blurb: 

""*What is Bitcoin? How does it work? In this book you will find answers that go beyond the headlines.* 

*Whether you are an investor, a decision maker, or simply curious about Bitcoin, you will learn the key concepts behind the digital money: the blockchain, miners, digital signatures, and much more. Step by step, example by example. You do not need a Math degree to understand Bitcoin; this book will take you from not knowing anything about crypto-currencies to understanding Bitcoin completely: all the technologies used, why they are being used and how. It includes chapters on how to buy and store bitcoins, how Bitcoin is updated, and the newest evolutions in sight, such as the Lightning Network and Schnorr signatures. If you want to understand the evolution and revolution of digital currencies, this book is for you*.""

So, I hope you read the book, it's a pretty long and dense read, but hopefully worth your time. You can get a free sample from the Amazon website. Enjoy!

4,Three True Stories about Physical Currency,2,e5rn9s,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e5rn9s/three_true_stories_about_physical_currency/,3,"I think both of these have bearing on crypto

1. The Mafia in Italy uses the old Lira bills to settle debts among themselves. These bills have no official value anymore but have assumed significant value. Not sure why this happened, maybe that large amounts of such bills are not illegal to have?
2. Pablo Escobar actually burnt millions of dollars to simply keep his family warm while on the run
3. Drug dealers lose a lot of currency to mold",1575452347.0
5,Optimized (₿) Marketing,2,e5rfg4,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e5rfg4/optimized_marketing/,4,"***The Request***: If the (₿) community and devs reached a consensus to change the name of these 5 currencies, the overall marketing and adoption would increase ***significantly***. The mainstream confusion + negative bias is from ""coin"" attached to the names of these currencies. For example: change ""Bitcoin"" to ""BTC"" (the acronym). If the community and devs reached an agreement to change ""coin"" in the next 2 years we could exponentially gain traction to the overall decentralized digital money space. I ***guarantee***  you this will drive long term trust and eliminate confusion. ***ALSO*** the change in names will 100% get **all media attention the week this goes into play.**

 **(How is this not the obvious solution?)**

I just got a remote job that pays me in crypto. Should i apply for a German residency and then be eligible for German taxation or is it not worth?

Also I have seen that in Germany ""private sales that do not exceed 600 euros are tax exempted."" Does that mean that if i exchange my crypto salary into fiat straight away, i'll never have to pay tax? Another good solution could be to use crypo backed loans as it is not considered a taxable event?

Thanks a lot guys for your feedback :)",1575446323.0
