3,"A nice short answer, thanks! Two follow-up questions if you don't mind

1. What does the ""x3 margin"" mean? Does it show that you can borrow 3 times the amount you have? 
2. Where can i see when my money will get liquidated if i would use margin and borrow money to trade with",,,,,,
4,"Yes 3x means  3 times of your asset value.
Eg. If you have 100 usd you take 3x margin in usd and buy all the btc of that amount. 
If your btc increase 10% your profit will be 30 usd.
You can calculate the liquidation price using following formula.

Liquidation price in % = 1/x 
where x is your margin rate.
so if you take 3x margin it will be 1/3= 33.33 
Now if  price goes down to 33 % your asset will be liquidated.",,,,,,

22,"Yes, if the price of Bitcoin falls far enough, most of the miners would be forced to shut down and the difficulty target would get slashed and the real-world cost of a 51% would fall, proportionally. But that doesn't change what I explained above -- the cost of a 51% attack will still be many times higher than the value of the Bitcoins being heisted... since, remember, in the case where Bitcoin prices have fallen, so has the value of the bounty from a 51% attack.

In the other direction, if the price of Bitcoin increases a lot, then so will the hashrate (to meet the difficulty target) and that much more mining equipment is required to mount a 51% attack.

The price of Bitcoin is a free variable vis-a-vis a 51% attack. It doesn't matter what the price of Bitcoin is, the cost of a 51% attack is in relatively fixed proportion to the value of the bounty of the attack. Not only this, but a successful 51% attack would cause a complete collapse in the value of Bitcoin (to $0) and the mining equipment would afterwards have no capital value... so it's really a scorched-earth attack. You could use the same cash to just buy a bunch of mining rigs and earn cash from them without losing their capital value.

A free market in currency means that if what you’re describing happens to one currency, people can switch to another without being forced to use the one that’s being manipulated.
Cryptocurrency is for everyone because nobody controls cryptocurrency, at most some people could try and control the majority of one, but it only retains functional value if others also still use it, incentivising them to avoid manipulation.
Fiat currency is entirely controlled, all of the time and when it gets manipulated it’s a case of ‘fuck you, you still have to use it’.
Bitcoin is just one currency. It’s also worth noting that no matter how much some people control some of it, they cannot create more of it beyond what it already allows for and therefore cannot devalue your holdings relative to the global supply of the coin itself.",,,,,,
42,">are a select few who control the value of Bitcoin, 

Value isn't just price , and if a billionaire buys up some BTC you benefit from added appreciation and more security. Also keep in mind that running a full node empowers you to veto any decision others make whether they are a  large investor or a miner. 

Here is a breakdown of the power dynamics in bitcoin when it comes to the rules of the protocol.

Ultimately economic users hold the most value and determine the immediate outcome in a Hard fork split. 

**Miners** have invested a lot in infrastructure , but have tight margins and typically have electrical and rental contracts where they cannot afford to mine coins that are unprofitable for long due to the community rejecting it. 

**exchanges** Have a lot of influence upon the naming of tokens or at least their ticker and act as somewhat of a large investor. This is another reason among many that we advise you to store your BTC yourself because we want users to be in control and not large centralized exchanges. They can also help predict an outcome of a split with future trading pairs. 


**Merchants and payment processors** give legitimacy to a chain , increase its network effect and influence more users to use that chain in the long term

**Developers, specialists and Oracles**  They cannot force code upon the users and since nodes don't self update economic users can reject their proposals with as little as inaction. These people indirectly influence economic users indirectly because the whole ecosystem depends upon them for security fixes and updates. Many developers are extremely large stakeholders due to being involved in Bitcoin since 2010 and 2011. 

**economic Users** have the most control. Ones that validate the rules with a full node cannot be coerced into new rules even with 100% of hashpower deciding upon something. Since miners have such high overhead they will typically quickly follow the lead of these users because they buy their product and it is quite costly to ignore their wishes. 

Not all economic users are equal however and there are different types of economic users. 

1) **Spenders** tend to use bitcoin for its utility and buy it just to spend instead of long term investment. These cannot influence HF split outcomes much because they typically do not have many BTC at any given time thus aren't awarded many BTC split tokens to wield their influence with

2) **Hodlers / Investors** These individuals have a great power and there are approximately ~70 large whales in our ecosystem who have between 10,000 and 100k BTC . Since they are given both sides of the coin in HF they can quickly determine the outcome in a speculation war . These people tend to be conservative IMHO with scaling as they have greatly profited from the years of stability and have a lot to risk by any proposal that damages bitcoins key characteristics or security. With every passing year the amount of large whales will drop and BTC will become more evenly distributed.

In reality we want bitcoiners to be both spenders and investors and there is a spectrum in the two above with how much one fits in each category",,,,,,
43,"You may misunderstand freedom in general. Free speech might be be more able to be used by some, but the right is for everyone. Bitcoin is open to anyone. The price relative to fiat is a fact of the free market, not decisions of a central bank.",,,,,,
44,I couldn’t agree more. It’s definitely being controlled by whales. Finite number of coins and big wallets control the swings. People really think it just happens to take a dive at the end of each year then jump back up? Lol yea that’s manipulation,,,,,,

46,"Put it this way, Bitcoin is open for everyone, everyone has a chance to get a piece of it. But how large the portion of it you are going to possess, it is up to you, trading is a democracy. Don't equate them two. 

With every passing year, the number of large whales will decline since whales also have to sell at a certain rate (even high), but hey, it is an open market, there is a demand, there is a supply. BTC will become more evenly distributed over time.",,,,,,
47,"> the same big players

48,"No, you're 100% right. The problem is people who are whales were the ones who bought into Bitcoin when it wasn't worth anything, so they ultimately had the headstart. The problem of centralization of Bitcoin is not only in the vast amounts of BTC that whales own, but also in how mining has become centralized. A system is naturally going to become centralized if there is a way to profit from it.",,,,,,
49,"Already lots of good thoughts being shared. IMO the benefit Bitcoin has is the known scarcity. Whales can use their money to buy islands or move the market, but when the bitcoins are gone they are gone. Any new bitcoin have to be earned.

59,"I do have a choice, I don’t have to attach a value to fiat whatsoever, since to me, fiat is worthless. I can’t speak from the perspective of anyone who isn’t an anarcho-capitalist however.

If you feel that the currency is being manipulated too much, get rid of it. Switch to one that meets your requirements. It’s important to remember that as much as they might accumulate, there still needs to be a use for it to have any value to them in the first place and if they accumulate enough of it, it’ll become functionally useless and everyone will move elsewhere, rendering their hoard effectively worthless.

The key advantages are that nobody can just print more out of nowhere, your percentage of the overall supply will not go up or down and you can move between currencies to avoid manipulation. Plus of course nobody can freeze your crypto wallet, nobody can fine it automatically, nobody can tax it, plenty of advantages, None of those are possible with fiat.

Also, in response to the comment above you. How is this off-topic? I genuinely wanted a discussion and I've gotten a lot of great, informative response.",,,,,,
63,"Fiat may be worthless to you (have no worth), but certainly isn’t valueless (no value). You’ve got intrinsic value in fiat - the fact that you can trade what is worthless to you for something that is valuable, makes fiat have value. If you didn’t value fiat, you wouldn’t accept it at all, since there would be nothing you could do with it, or you’d freely give it out and expect nothing (or little) in return. But because you can exchange it for goods of value, its intrinsically valuable to you. How much value (as a percentage of the “market exchange rate”) is up to you. Would you pay $2 for a $1 cheese burger? Some might, but others who value fiat higher wouldn’t. You’d be hard pressed to find someone willing to pay $1 million for a $1 burger because of how little they valued fiat.

All that means that bitcoin does have a fiat value attached to it, and you can’t escape that.

Otherwise, I agree with what you’ve said. They’re good points (minus the “nobody can fine it”/“nobody can tax it”, since you don’t fine/tax currency, you fine/tax entities).",,,,,,

66,"Value is an individual subjective measurement. You trade what you have for something else because you value that something else more than what you originally had. In this case, my personal value of non-fiat currency relative to fiat is far higher than the rate of exchange.

I will agree that funds can be frozen/seized, but you said taxed/fined. Neither of those apply to fiat. Your funds can be seized for not paying fines, but fines themselves are levied upon the users. You can still be taxed (and will be if it continues to grow & replace currencies) with bitcoin. You can voluntarily pay that tax, since there’s no way to force that like traditional fiat, but it’s hard to use your BTC if you’ve been put in jail for failure to pay taxes...",,,,,,

Thus you can see other peoples concerns here, but I hope we answered your questions. Cheers",,,,,,
72,"Sure, I'm not arguing that, I'm just clarifying what I meant in my original statement, now that I'm not a few beers into my evening as I was when I wrote my first two comments, I'm not sure where you're from, but in a lot of places, taxation happens before the average person ever receives any fiat in the first place! I'm under the impression that this is different in the US though, I'm guessing that is all done manually by the individual at some point?

You can only be taxed on crypto if the address can be linked to an individual, I'd also argue that a voluntary tax is an oxymoron, a 'voluntary tax' is just a donation, taxation is coercively extracting funds via threat of force, but that's a philosophical and ethical question separate from the point anyway. If the state required donation and could no longer track everyone's finances to do what they currently are, I'd be a lot happier overall! 

The point was simply that no outside force can take control of your crypto without you having to act to allow them to do so, which is worlds apart from fiat! It puts a lot of the economic power into the hands of each individual instead of a small centralised group that control the supply of currency!

I hope that somewhat clears up what my thoughts are a bit better, I'm sorry I didn't word things too well in my earlier comments!",,,,,,
73,"No, I'm talking from my personal principles, you're just being a dick because you don't share them.
I don't believe that the state is a valid institution or that it has any actual authority over anyone, but they're still going to point guns at people to create the same effect as if they did. 
I only interact with fiat at all because I have to, there is no option to opt out of the fiat system currently. I get given fiat and immediately trade it away to people who do see value in it so that I can get things that actually hold value to me. My own shit has no value to me either, but if someone offered me a few grams of gold for it, you can bet that I'm going to bag my shit up and make that trade any day.
I donate to charity already thankyou, I don't need any help figuring out how to do that.
You don't have to share my perspective and I understand completely if you disagree, that's no reason to be an arsehole and that's not going to convince anyone who doesn't already share your view.",,,,,,
74,"That’s fair. US taxation is done in a couple ways: 1) employers report & pay on employees’ behalf 2) use/consumption/sales tax is collected at time of purchase of a good/service 3) additional institutions/banks report earnings of investments (stocks/bonds/interest/etc 4) manual adjustments are made by the person to finalize the details for the previous year.

A person could report different things and either owes or (in the cast of the majority of Americans) is owed some amount of money. Discrepancies cause flags, more flags has a higher chance of audit, plus a random smattering of audits happen throughout the year.

Addresses don’t need to be linked to individuals because the individual is taxed directly. It doesn’t matter how many wallets you have or where, if you earned 1 BTC in income, you pay 0.1 BTC in taxes. If that’s in a single wallet or 10 wallets, it doesn’t matter, you, as an individual, still owe 0.1. Wanna claim you lost them all? You’ll have to file a police report, your wages will be garnished (by forcing businesses to pay the government before you), and if all else fails, you’ll wind up in prison. If it’s *ever* discovered that you still had access to those coins in the future, you’re busted on years of fraudulent history (false taxes, false police reports, etc).

I agree on the “voluntary tax”. My use of “voluntary” was to echo the nonsense of people here to say “lost mine in a boating accident”. It’s tax evasion, illegal and ill advised. But, as you said, with crypto, you can’t be forced to surrender your crypto, just your person (and other assets).

No worries on wording, just don’t want to continue to spread the “use bitcoin to evade taxes” BS that people spout off. If crypto makes existing taxation difficult, you can be guaranteed that taxation methods are changed. The government is gonna get its money one way or another.",,,,,,

76,"No, I’m telling you that an average market price and value are different things. value is subjective and based on the individual. You would never buy or sell anything in your life if you didn’t value something over another.
If you value what I have more than what you have and vice versa, then we will both trade and in turn we both gain value from each other.
If you value the fiat in your wallet more than a pizza, you wouldn’t buy a pizza. If you value the pizza more, you’ll trade the fiat for the pizza. At the same time, the person selling the pizza will value the fiat higher than the pizza or they wouldn’t sell it in the first place.
You can then take all of those trades and determine the average market price for something, but that’s all it is, an average market price.

Then, the premium is:    ($GBTC - $btc x .00097)/($btc x .00097)

 There was a website that calculated it for you [here](https://crypto.neotechdevs.com/). But, it stopped updating a few weeks ago...

**Best wallets for securing small amounts of BTC**

**electrum** For Desktop and Android

Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control 

Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets, make sure you only upgrade from official sources like play store or https://electrum.org as malicious servers or adverts can tell you to upgrade malware from other sites

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4EhZg5QslI

**Éclair** LN wallet for Android and desktop

Pros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees

Cons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental ,Some users may want to use other LN wallets. http://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq4lF2s4UtI

**hodlwallet** IOS and android wallet

Pros- Much better UX than other wallets and slick look as it’s a fork of the original Bread wallet

Cons- lacks some privacy features found in electrum 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_KDf5WYfzQ

**Blockstream Green Wallet** IOS and android wallet

Pros- Great UX, easy hardware wallet and full node integration, RBF, HW wallet support and advanced 2fa options
Cons- Until single signature is released 2 of 2 multisig means that one must depend upon blockstream’s server for tx signing. Other light wallets are dependent upon other servers as well but light wallets like electrum allow you to swap servers.

127,"""Best"" is subjective. It's like asking which car is the best. Here's a rough overview:

Software wallets. Bitcoin Core is the best in terms of security. It's the most reviewed piece of software, verifies the blockchain, etc. Then there's Wasabi Wallet which is a bit more advanced, but helps your privacy like no other wallet. But... Neither of them works on mobile, so in terms of mobility you'll want something like Samourai Wallet or Green Wallet. If you want LN there's Breez. Mobile wallets typically sacrifice a little bit of security and privacy though.

Hardware wallets. There's Coldcard, Trezor and Ledger. All are good, there are slight differences in how they handle security, but overall you'll be fine with any of them.

So there's plenty of great wallets out there, it really depends on your needs. If you just want to hodl get a hardware wallet. If you want to transact in bitcoin start small with any reputable software wallet, get comfortable with it, and then see if there's something better for your needs.",,,,,,

As long as you are not giving him your private key it's all good. He needs your private key to spend your Bitcoin.

No, they can not.

That being said, signing messages does produce a ***very*** small danger.  It exposes your ***public*** keys.

Exposing your public keys before you spend could be a problem in 50 years or so, but for now it should be fine.  Just be aware that it reduces your protection from a far-future QC attack.",,,,,,

Mostly, not real wallets. If the Web site controls the Bitcoin keys, then it's their wallet, not yours. You only have an account on the Web site, not a wallet  

> you need public and private key

You need hundreds, maybe thousands of private keys, with one Bitcoin address per key. A Bitcoin address is a single-use token

> therefore it is not in the ledger

The ledger contains transactions  
Transactions contain inputs and outputs  
A transaction output is a coin  
A transaction input spends a coin from an older transaction  
A coin can only be spent once  
A coin can not be partially spent  

An output (coin) contains an address and an amount  
Addresses do not exist in the ledger as addresses, except in the context of being part of a transaction output  

> how does one create valid bitcoin wallet?

Create enough private keys for your predictable future use, and be able to create more when they've all been used once  

> Can one exhaust all wallet combinations

A private key is a very long integer - 256 bits long  
It is so long that it would take all the computers in the future history of the earth more time than the future history of the universe to accidentally find another person's key  
It would be easier to find a key in an old, discarded computer, or on paper in a dumpster than to attempt to compute all possible values",,,,,,

No. Watch this video to understand why -

>Also, how does cold wallet storage works? Only storing the private key and public key and thats it?

cold storage simply means your private keys are secured in such a way that they never contact directly with a network connected device. 

This means that Hardware wallet technically are not cold storage devices if you connect them to your internet connected laptop or phone but they are quasi  cold storage insomuch as the private keys never leave the device and all tx signing occurs in the hardware wallet.

The exception to this is  hardware wallets like cold card which  allow you true cold storage with PSBTs -

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kocEpndQcsg

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8dBNrlwJ0k

Otherwise cold storage is just a backup on paper or metal waiting to be imported or swept later on . In the past people used to copy down a private key and address on paper for cold storage but this is an obsolete way to secure your Bitcoin and never should be used. 

These days you should store 12 /18 / 24 words for cold storage or use a multisig or SSS(although multisig  is better) for these reasons -

212,"To say that an address is registered at some point risks misunderstanding how the derivation of private keys and public keys work. Basically it is more correct to say that all valid addresses (and their corresponding private and public keys) already exist before they are ever used. Basically once an address is used, you can prove who is the owner of it based on possessing the private key that was used to generate the address. (You don't need to have registered this anywhere, with anyone beforehand for them to be able to verify that you have the key)

It's a bit like if you consider the sum:  A + B \* C = D

You could say that all answers for D already exist based on valid possible selections of A, B and C where these are positive whole numbers less than say, 1,000,000. (It could be infinite, or anything, but lets just have some constraints on A, B and C to help imagine the protocol rules that Bitcoin imposes)

You are right in that the public ledger continues to grow, the Bitcoin blockchain is a few hundred GB right now and still grows. Mobile wallets (and any non-full node wallet) generally has a server that it ""trusts"" to be able to work out balances, etc, but it still does all the generation of keys, signing of transactions, etc, itself. (and invalid transactions will still be rejected by miners) You can also validate what a lite wallet like this wallet is telling you with a full node at home (or somewhere) that you trust to be telling the truth.",,,,,,

Yes, but most of the ledger is irrelevant history. Day-to-day use requires knowing just enough history to prove a coin exists and has not been spent already

Yes, The private keys and transaction signing occur within the ledger so even if your computer  is compromised the private key generation and wallet use is secure as long as you verify the tx address on your HW screen 

> Also, same question for running Ledger Live.

This is fine to use or you can use  electrum for more features

>In other words, how to avoid being pwned right from the start.

Do not keep your HW wallet in the same location as your backup words
The HW wallet itself doesn't need to be hidden except if you are trying to limit the amount of people who know you have Bitcoin in the first place because it protected by a pin and or passphrase where wrong entries delay retries exponentially and/or reset the HW wallet after a while.
Thus the focus should be on securing the BIP39 backup words .

1) Do not store these digitally

2) Never write down the pin or passphrase together with the 12/18/24 words

3) At minimum secure the backup 12/18/24 words on paper in a sealed plastic bag to protect against moisture or flooding. Do not laminate as certain adhesives can damage the ink.

4) If you can afford , upgrade to a metal backup (steel , copper brass... but aluminum is unacceptable)

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test/

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test--part-ii-/

5) Keep backup private and secure , whoever gets a hold of this can steal your BTC!

6) Pin you will just store in memory as that is not needed to restore a backup, but if you use the advanced passphrase feature you will need to back this up in memory and best to backup written down as well (paper or metal) . Passphrase should be kept separate than your backup 12/18/24 words

232,"A Great Tool for Cryptocurrency Investors

Cryptocurrency investors are responsible for securing their own funds.

&#x200B;

And if you’re looking to secure cryptocurrency, the Ledger Nano S is one of the easiest and cheapest ways

You can use the Ledger Nano S to store ETH, ETC, Dash, Ripple, Stratis, ZCash, Litecoin, NEO, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash, Viacoin and a few other alt currencies (including BTC). You can see a complete list here.

Because it’s an HD wallet, you control many accounts for all supported cryptocurrencies. This means that all cryptos stored here will be secure with the same backup key. So let’s say you are storing Bitcoin for your friends or family, you can label those account for them and keep them safe as if they were your own.

Ledger supports all ERC tokens when used with MyEtherWallet. I have already tested this.

Ledger is compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS. It can also connect to your Android device using an OTG cable.

To receive Bitcoin, your Ledger Nano S doesn’t need to be connected to a computer. You can receive Bitcoin even if your Ledger is offline.

&#x200B;

Your Bitcoin private key is stored in a secured section of the device itself. It doesn’t ever leave the device, and hence, there’s no way for a hacker to get to it.

The Ledger Nano S is an HD wallet. This means that every time you receive funds, you get a new receiving address. This enhances your privacy to a great extent.

You can also sign a message using the Ledger Nano S to prove your ownership of the address. You may use this feature in the future when you advance in your Bitcoin and cryptocurrency usage.

There are more advantages of using Ledger Nano S that you will discover as you become more comfortable with the device.",,,,,,

>Is it possible to just upgrade my current Electrum or do I need to uninstall it and install a newer version of Electrum?


Simply installing the new version of electrum will upgrade it. Just make sure you always use a reputable source as malware exists. 

https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-do-i-upgrade-electrum

https://electrum.org/#download

**If malware exists at the time you sweep or import the keys on the computer than you run a risk of losing the BTC. This is why hardware wallets exist.(perhaps consider getting a HW wallet instead if this is too confusing for you.) It is safer than OSX/windows to install electrum on a clean android(no sketchy apps or rooted or sideloaded apps) or a clean version of TAILS/QUBES/Ubuntu.**

HW wallets - https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/e2hhxo/is_coinbase_good_place_to_start_in_usa_or_please/f8vsszz/

>We share the same IP, so will Electrum still allow me to create a new Electrum that will work independently of my now obsolete Electrum on my desktop PC?

The IP doesn't matter here. If you use the same 12 word seed it will simply be a mirror of the other one. Just make sure you keep the 12 word seed private and secure even if you don't store the BTC on the wallet. Realistically I would suggest not storing private keys and just secure the seed phrase and if you are concerned about malware on your PC you can delete electrum after you backup your seed thus-

Step 1 - install electrum on your PC as a new wallet , select native/bech32 segwit , and generate a new 12 word seed that you backup . Keep these 12 words private and secure and at minimum in plastic bag or insert to protect from water/moisture damage.

Step 2 - Sweep, don't import, the private keys into this wallet 

Step 3 (optional) - Once you backed up your words and sweeps the private keys you can verify the backup by installing electrum on your android and recovering from the 12 words 

Step 4 - delete the wallets from your device if you want cold storage only 

Step 5 (optional) - upgrade to a metal wallet backup

240,"Just install the latest version by downloading it from [electrum.org](https://electrum.org). You don't have to uninstall the old version. Just install the new one on top of the old one.

Regarding your question about IP addresses and what electrum will and will not allow you to do you should know that electrum is software that runs on your PC. It is not a website or some remote account you log in to. It doesn't care what IP you have and you don't have to ask permission from anyone to use electrum.",,,,,,
241,"You can just download the update and install it, it will replace the old version.

You can verify that the download is authentic by following these instructions: https://youtu.be/lCG3c8a7HZI

If you don't have a balance stored in electrum, you could also use it with a hardware wallet like a Ledger or Trezor, as that way the funds are able to be stored and used in a more secure way while still using  Electrum. (If that is the interface you are familiar with)",,,,,,
242,"This is actually *very* easy but there are some steps you **must** do:

1. Only download software from [electrum.org](https://electrum.org) that you typed into your browser yourself. Never trust any other source.
2. Access your current wallet and *write down the seed words* and *store them securely off your computer*. These words will allow you to recreate your wallet on *any* device so treat them like printed bitcoin. A safety deposit box or similar security is indicated if you have any significant amount of BTC. If you don't store any BTC in your current wallet you can just delete it and create a new one.
3. Please reconsider the safety of paper wallets - there are *many* ways to lose your BTC when using them. 

Once these are done, you can create a wallet on any PC / laptop (Apple or Windows) or Android phone. It is not important what device it is on (or its IP).  When you download the newest Electrum (see step 1), just choose ""I already have a seed phrase"" and your wallet should be restored on whatever device you are using.

243,"Thank you for the reply.  I think you helped me a few years back when I was just learning about Bitcoin.

I have no devices or smart phones, only my desktop computer and the hubby's laptop.  The electrum is on my desktop, and it is an out-of-date version that I would be afraid to use now.  

So if I install a new electrum wallet on the laptop, it will have no connection whatever to the electrum on the desktop computer? 

This should work for me and is probably the best solution.  I remember how I installed the current electrum, so I should be able to do this again, and write down the new seed words.  I don't know how to delete software, but I am going to need to hire a tech help guy to upgrade my desktop computer from windows 7 to windows 10 so I can just get him to uninstall the old electrum at the same time.

I know that paper wallets as well as windows are viewed unfavorably, but I need to stick with what I know because at this point in my life learning new things is confusing and trying to navigate the unfamiliar would likely prove more dangerous.  I'm comfortable with paper wallets and electrum.  I generated enough paper wallets several years ago to last me forever, and never had a problem sweeping them into my electrum. The fact is I'm unlikely to actually spend anymore of my btc during what remains of my lifetime, but I'd like to regain the ability to do so just in case.  More likely it will sit in cold storage until I decide to give it away rather than have it be lost when I go.

262,"Just an FYI on the specifics. Withdrawing with coinbase pro there is no delay , no fee,  and no batching , but they use native segwit to send from or change return to. 

Withdrawing from coinbase there is no delay either once the hold is lifted and they overcharge on a withdraw fee unlike with pro so one should never withdraw via coinbase , and instead tx the funds from coinbase to coinbase pro for free than withdraw

With cash app , the delay is a few seconds because they do a smart mini batch 5-20 UTXOs , there is no fee, and they send from native segwit addresses",,,,,,
263,"Yes, when you buy Bitcoin on coinbase they have at least a 1 week hold on your BTC withdrawals , specifically due to the nature of the ACH needing to clear(If you buy with a debit card you won't necessarily have this BTC hold). Lately they have started even allowing you to gradually withdraw small amounts of BTC that are on hold in increments as well

Thus with regular coinbase a client can expect a 1 week BTC hold when you buy with bank transfers , and 2 weeks or more with their initial purchase 

With coinbase pro there is no hold but it also takes around a week for the fiat to deposit from a bank transfer unless they do a wire so the net effect is similar 

The BTC hold also prevents you from sending the BTC from coinbase to coinbase pro until it is released as well.

Simply - don't use coinbase as a wallet, ever.

Consider the original question. It's possible that it was asked because OP was asked to withdraw from coinbase for someone - or that they MUST use a coinbase wallet to receive. Or they want to use coinbase as a mixer (receive back different coins than sent in). All of the above would likely cost OP because coinbase DOES filter and apply holds on withdrawal.",,,,,,

Depositing BTC into coinbase requires 3 confirmations before sending it or selling it from coinbase. 

Withdrawing or spending BTC from coinbase to private wallet/merchant is instant and confirmations come as normal(but the tx shows immediately in your wallet)

Spending BTC from coinbase wallet to coinbase merchant is instant (I.E. Coinbase to purse.io)

280,"Difficulty is a variable set by the network every 2016 blocks based on how quickly those blocks were found (every two weeks). The difficulty is set so that the next 2016 blocks should take about 10 minutes each.

Your odds to find a block is your hash power divided by the total hash power of the network. This is because mining is a competition.

When you mine in a pool the likelihood to find a block is the hash power of the whole pool divided by the total network hash power. Even though the likelihood of finding a block goes up with the pool it does not necessarily increase your personal reward because the pool will typically split the reward between miners by their hash contributions and charge a fee.

In my explanation the odds of finding a block are per block, so those are approximately the odds every ten minutes. You can find the total odds of finding a block within a better time set, like the difficulty period of 2016 you can take the 1 minus the percentage for a single block to the power of 2016 for the odds you WON'T find a block in that time period.",,,,,,
281,"Hashing is a guessing contest. The SHA2 algorithm is designed to produce a random distribution of results. Satoshi's words explain the relationship between work and the size of the target range  

> The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash

https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf  

Bitcoin mining no longer uses the ""number of zero bits"" at the beginning to define the target hash. Instead the target is defined as a maximum value, because this can be adjusted more finely. Counting the leading zero bits only allows for adjustment in powers of two. The target is a range - from zero to the current maximum. The average amount of work (number of hashes) to find a hash within the target range is dependent on the current size of the target range, a smaller range requires more work  

> if I take part in a bigger mining pool that collectively has more hash power compared to a smaller pool, does it mean I'm more likely to win bitcoins in the pool with higher hashing power?

You personally have no more chance whether you're in a big or small pool. You will earn your share of the pool's winnings according to the pool's sharing rules  

A pool with a hash rate of 20 Exahashes per second is twice as likely to find a block as a pool with 10 Exahashes per second. In practice, a miner will earn the same amount in either pool. In the 20Eh pool she will earn half as much per payment, and be paid twice as often",,,,,,
282,"It's like playing the lottery. If you buy one lottery card you may win. If you buy 10'000 of lottery cards and play your likelihood to win is increased by the factor of 10'000. 

But still very very very slim.

Same with mining. You invest in hardware and energy. Even if you have hundreds of miners running. You probably never solve the hashing puzzle. That's why you enter a mining pool. If someone in the pool wins, 12.5btc are equally shared based on how much hashing/guessing you brought to the pool.

284,"*mind-blown*, this totally makes sense now. Thank you so much. Just a follow on question, with regards to the pools sharing rules. I understand there are different payment approaches adopted by different pools. I also read up that one gets paid based on the amount one contributes as hash power to winning the block. 

Now, based on pay per share, how does one know if they are being paid accurately by the pool for the amount of hash power one contributed? Could there be instances where the pool doesn't pay the miner a fair amount for their contribution? Is it possible for the miner to verify how much he/she contributed? 

Thanks in advance, much appreciated.",,,,,,

Since orphan rate is so low these days due to improvements in block propagation (Improvements like FIBRE) , one can get a pretty good idea just from their hash rate contributed and expected returns with calculators like - https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/calculator

Some pools like Slush's even have a method to prove their total hashrate thus allowing you to determine your % share and expected payouts are fair as well-

334,"1) cash app and coinbase pro have no withdraw fee so both are fine. Never withdraw with regular coinbase because they overcharge on a fee. 

Here is a comparison - 

**Coinbase pro**

Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They have a fee of 0.5%

OK- they receive with P2SH segwit 

Bad-  they dont batch anymore on withdrawls. It takes a week for you to ACH them fiat 

**Cash App**

 Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They batch txs as well in a sophisticated manner where you don't have to wait.(last time i waited 1 min for a confirmation and the UTXOs where batched with a bunch of txs). You can instantly lock in the price

OK- The fees are higher than coinbase pro being at ~1.7% but actually lower than coinbase(1.49%) because their spread is higher (cash app is usually cheaper market price than coinbase ). Being that you can instantly lock in the price unlike with coinbase pro there is a role here even at the higher fee. 

Bad-  to deposit BTC they still use legacy addresses (not even P2SH segwit)

I think you are confused about return address? 

When you send BTC your wallet aggregates the best unspent outputs UTXO together. Like real cash. You want to buy something for $9.90. You get all best fitting change so that you will get the least change in return. The wallet will do that for you. The return goes back in a new address that you wallet created on the fly with your private key for you. You don't have to create that address by yourself. Every HD wallet does that for you.

&#x200B;

""WITHDRAWAL

## Q. How long do withdrawals take to process?

## Q. What does it mean ""You can withdraw your funds only on address, which is registered and verified with your account? To verify your address with your account, you need to make a deposit from this address.""?

It means that verifying your identity through deposit helps prevent fraud and ensures that no one, except you, is able to use your payment information to make changes. Click to Deposit at the left tab, select the required amount BTC that will be added to your account balance, send BTC from any external wallet, where you are going to withdraw in the future, ( Blockchain, Coinbase, etc.) to the address at deposit application and the verification process will be completed automatically, you will be able to withdraw your funds instant.""

Conclusion

1. The funds he will send you are useless, because you can't transfer them outside that cryptobull site, and you can't use them anywhere outside of it.
2. The scam in this, it's to make a deposit some funds to verify your blockchain address in order  you  be able to make external withdrawal ""wich will never gonna happen"" because all this scam story goes on this deposit that he wants you to make.
3. he is the owner of this scam platform, because he was asking me to if i'm having an account on it , like it's a famous platform but it's only 26 days old.

Step 3 - Tell him to send you the BTc directly and provide him the receive address by sharing it 

**Likely** Step 4 - listen to him/her make excuses because he was trying to scam you. Do not ever accept BTC the first way he is trying to pay you... that website was just setup and should not be trusted

Possible step 5 - If he is not a scammer he should have no problem sending you the Bitcoin, once they arrive in your wallet and you get at least 1 confirmation as shown in your wallet or an explorer (~10 minutes) you can transfer the domain name",,,,,,

It is an extra onchain tx , thus ~10 min more

394,"We must have humility and understand that we do not have more than the intelligence of the markets and anyone that claims they can predict the price movements is ignorant or lying

Best solution is to instabuy with coinbase or cash app on hard dips if you lack preloaded fiat in coinbase pro , and once you wait a week for your fiat to clear have multiple buy limits in coinbase pro to auto pickup and dips . If the buy limit orders do get get filled than after a set interval of you choosing make a market buy to DCA (Dollar cost Average)

You can DCA twice a month with your paycheck or once a month in addition to the buy limit orders. 

Make sure you have a fiat savings account for emergency and you make a spending budget to reduce expenses as well.

**Coinbase pro**

Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They have a fee of 0.5%

OK- they receive with P2SH segwit 

Bad-  they dont batch anymore on withdrawls. It takes a week for you to ACH them fiat 

**Cash App**

 Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They batch txs as well in a sophisticated manner where you don't have to wait.(last time i waited 1 min for a confirmation and the UTXOs where batched with a bunch of txs). You can instantly lock in the price

OK- The fees are higher than coinbase pro being at ~1.7% but actually lower than coinbase(1.49%) because their spread is higher (cash app is usually cheaper market price than coinbase ). Being that you can instantly lock in the price unlike with coinbase pro there is a role here even at the higher fee. 

Bad-  to deposit BTC they still use legacy addresses (not even P2SH segwit)",,,,,,

To me Bitcoin is a **microtipping solution** due to lightning wallets that I cannot do with fiat 

To me Bitcoin is a **insurance hedge** to protect against civil/asset forfeiture

To me Bitcoin is **Digital gold** and a highly appreciating uncorrelated asset class

To me Bitcoin is great for **regulatory arbitrage** whether that is donating to Wikileaks or deplatformed/debanked individuals, capital flight, or removing financial censorship 

To me Bitcoin is a **smart contract platform** where I can write and use scripts that I cannot do with fiat

To me Bitcoin is a **payment rail** where I can send money to employees internationally 

To me Bitcoin is a **truth timestamping database** where I can lock a contract or tweet  into the blockchain and prove its existence on a certain date/time

You can play a few coins (stay away from shitcoins) that have enough manipulable price action to get you what you want... Just be careful right now as BTC 7k support is weak, play it as such. 

I always used to say I wanted to hold BTC so I wasn’t the guy with all the stocks and his dick in his hand if the market went to shit... In my opinion though, if you want to make yourself a bonus, learn your option contracts and hit the street. BTC is baby money comparatively! I would more so view it as an investment, less of a trading instrument. To each their own though!

**Step 1 Setup a wallet** , and backup your words to keep them secret and private.

Here are some good wallets for beginners and video tutorials-

**Blockstream Green Wallet** IOS and android wallet

**Step 2 Buy BTC and transfer it to your personal wallet**- If you are in the USA than the best way to buy BTC is with cash app - https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/1016-bitcoin

If you need BTC slightly quicker or need to pay in cash than https://coinatmradar.com or https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin but fees are at least 7% and higher

If you are out of the US than look into coinbase pro, bitstamp, or kraken

How Bitcoin works under the hood: 
https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test--part-ii-/",,,,,,
419,General redditquette would usually suggest you read the links on the r/bitcoin sidebar first.,,,,,,
420,Well I guess he answered it...,,,,,,
421,"No matter what, don't respond to any private messages about bitcoin. Period.

Any questions you have or feedback you need, do it with posts and comments on this subreddit or one of the others. Transparent always.",,,,,,
422,I’ll be looking out for them! Thanks buddy!,,,,,,
423,"From what I understand vbyte essentially measures how much weight your transaction data is and how much of the block you'll take up. If you set your fee to 1 sat/vbyte and your transaction is 350vbytes. The total amount of fees you'll pay is 350 sats. 2 sats/vbyte = 700 sats total fees.

The higher your fee the more likely a miner is to stuff your transaction into their block. Estimating fees isn't too hard but it may be worth sending a handful of small transactions and seeing how long they take to confirm for yourself. Depending on the day and how busy the network is, 1 sat/vbyte fees usually clear in a few hours for me (5-8). I haven't yet had a transaction take longer than 16 hours or so. 5 sats/vbyte will usually get you in around an hour.

Keep in mind in my experience the network is usually kind of quiet. Except for some days when whales are consolidating utxos and taking up the mempool.

Edit: To be clear, fees are only paid when sending money out of your wallet. Fees are attached to your transaction data to pay the miners who secure the network via mining.",,,,,,
424,"With GW you also can increase the fee later. GW has the ability to RBF. Replace by fee. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Replace_by_fee

I always check on https://whatthefee.io/ first. But then sending with 1sat/byte.

Simplified: a transaction (tx) takes around 300bytes. It depends how much inputs you have. A good wallet always tries to figure out the best way. Think about inputs like small change in your wallet. If you need to buy something for 9.90 you give two 5$bills instead of nine 1$ and a lot of cents. = Heavy tx = more bytes = higher fees.

So if your tx is 300 bytes and you pay 1 Satoshi per byte you end up with a fee of 300 sats on top of what you want to pay.

 Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They batch txs as well in a sophisticated manner where you don't have to wait.(last time i waited 1 min for a confirmation and the UTXOs where batched with a bunch of txs). You can instantly lock in the price

OK- The fees are higher than coinbase pro being at ~1.7% but actually lower than coinbase(1.49%) because their spread is higher (cash app is usually cheaper market price than coinbase ). Being that you can instantly lock in the price unlike with coinbase pro there is a role here even at the higher fee. 

Bad-  to deposit BTC they still use legacy addresses (not even P2SH segwit)

It is up to the merchant or receiver to refund the Bitcoin if they want after it has been confirmed. Before it has been confirmed there are ways to get it possibly reversed.

>I'm curious to know what happens if you ""send"" to an address that doesn't exist.

Bitcoin was designed with a built in checksum(all address types have this) to make sure this is extremely unlikely to occur. The new address format even has a more sophisticated checksum that can even tell the wallet where the error occurred within the address and assist the user in correcting it and is so sophisticated it will **guarantee detection** of a typo even if you make up to 4 errors within an address -

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki

The native segwit format is designed with other clever tricks -

1) all lower case to allow for communicating verbally without mistakes easier and more fluid to communicate

2) Uses a character set that eliminates visual similarities

characters “1”, “b”, “i”, and “o” are not used in the address set , and 1 is only used as the seperator thus the address starts with bc (for Bitcoin)  and 1 (separator) than  the data part. Other commonly mistyped characters are targeted by the checksum to be detected as well 

3) An incredible amount of testing and computer cycles has gone into insuring the robustness and probabilities of this checksum 


>Isn't it possible to ""fat finger"" when typing an address, make a mistake, and actually input an address that doesn't exist yet? What would happen in a scenario like this?

The wallet would say invalid address and prevent the tx because the checksum doesn't match in +99.9999% scenarios",,,,,,
532,"[1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE)

Here is one such address.

A bitcoin address is a hash of a public key. If you construct the hash to be something, then chances are no one will be able to find anything that hashes to it, never mind a bitcoin public key. There is however no mechanism which prevents you from sending to such an address. This is known as burning coin, the coin is effectively destroyed.

Notice how the last few digits are random values. That’s because in classical bitcoin addressing, that is a checksum. Everything before that produces the hash, that last part is just to make sure the key was typed correctly. If you were to fat finger an address, that would catch it, it can fail but only in 1 in 4 billion times.

So long story short, you can't accidentally send coin to a wallet that does not exist. If you fat finger, there are mechanisms that protect you. Addresses that do not have corresponding wallets do exist but you would have to deliberately send to them, you can't fat finger them, and these addresses have to be specially crafted to pass checks.",,,,,,

586,"The network of Bitcoin nodes is a core, integral part of the Bitcoin system. You can create and sign a transaction without an Internet connection, but it must eventually be transmitted by some means to the network in order to have a real effect. The whole point of having a network is to have many parties validating transactions and enforcing immutability of the ledger. (Miners are also critical for the immutability part, but the non-mining nodes make it more robust.)

That said, NFC can be a way to communicate transactions. Let's say, for instance, one person has an Internet connection, and another doesn't. The person without the connection wants to make a payment. They could create and sign a transaction, then send it to the person who does have the connection, via NFC or whatever, and that person can then relay it to the network. There have already been experiments to do offline transactions. But of course, there's a problem of the sending device knowing whether or not their transaction was received, as this will affect all further transactions that device will try to make using change outputs (i.e. outputs that return to you the portion of a transaction you want to keep) of that transaction.

Some way to verify whether a transaction has been mined yet or not is also a good idea, because a transaction is not really ""official"" until it's in the blockchain; it's always possible for a transaction to never get mined and just be forgotten by the network, since nodes will drop transactions that have been in their mempool for a long time when they run out of space.

594,"I have had several people reach out to me after losing funds because they thought ""digital"" was better.

Storing a seed digitally tips the balance away from resilience to gain a small increase (unnecessary) in security. More people lose money to accidents and data corruption than theft, especially physical theft.

A paper seed is better, safer, more resilient. A digital copy of a seed is dangerous. 

Use the tech as designed. Follow the instructions developed by security experts. Stop trying to tweak and ""improve"" the security of the system. BIP39 with paper backups is the correct and best method. It is carefully calibrated to balance security and resilience.

To answer your points more specifically:

* digital can have extra layer of encryption

BIP39 seeds can also have an extra layer, using the additional passphrase. Unlike your DIY encryption, this is based on a standard. If something happens to you no one will be able to figure out how you encrypted it. In addition, you have to backup the encryption key, which opens a whole other set of problems. This is easiest with a passphrase, but still difficult. Most people don't need this.  

* digital is smaller and more convenient

Not once you consider the device you need to write to the digital storage. A USB drive needs a laptop. That laptop is the biggest source of additional risk and needs to be stored with the USB device. You can enter a 24-word seed directly into a hardware wallet (on screen word selection) while connected only to a battery (charger brick) over USB cable. 

* digital is not an obvious secret/password

True, but that's security by obscurity, not real security. Anyone who knows what a seed is can also find out you have crypto and search for an encrypted digital device. You're only making it hard for anyone who might inherit your crypto, if you care about heirs or dependents. Keep it simple. 

* thief can make a picture of written phrase, not knowing somebody stole your seeds. 

Thief can make a copy of a digital device and crack the encryption passphrase at their own leisure. In both cases you need to physically secure the key material (locks, keys, safes) and preferrably use a tamper evident mechanism (sealed tamper-evident opaque bags work great for seeds)

* someone not tech savvy, will find your bootable storage device useless as he can't read it in windows/mac

Again, security by obscurity. You are more likely to lose access due to a data corruption accident. Keep it simple. More people have lost bitcoin this way than you can imagine. I know, they often email me and ask for help. 

* thief that doesn't know anything about Bitcoin, will still make a picture of your seedphrase and find it out on Google.

If you leave your seed laying around, yes. But that's just poor security. You shouldn't be doing that anyway. 


Bottom line:

Digital copies of seeds are more vulnerable, introduce other risks (access device, loss of encryption key, non-standard encryption, data-loss, electromagnetic damage etc). They tip the balance away from resilience, without adding a meaningful amount of security. You can achieve the same security goals by following standards (BIP39, passphrase, SLIP39, multisig, hardware wallets). Attempts to roll-your-own security almost always backfire spectacularly. 

I advise people who store anywhere from $hundreds  to $hundreds of millions. They don't lose their funds. They don't get them stolen. They can recover from data loss, incapacity, death, ownership transitions and other life events. 

Despite all of the above, despite my endless attempts to advise people not to do this, despite writing this kind of message about once every couple of months... hundreds of people will get ""smart"" with their seeds and do something that will make them lose money. Then they email me asking if I can help and I have to deliver the bad news. Last week I got an email from someone who lost 7BTC because of getting creative and misjudging their technical expertise. 

Don't play with this stuff unless you're an expert. If you're asking these questions you are not an expert. Follow the standards, don't get ""smart"", don't lose your BTC.

597,"- The idea with the seed is that it's all you need to restore your wallet. So it's the backup of last resort when you have nothing else not even the wallet file encryption password.

- The wallet file already contains the seed so in a way you already have a digital copy. You may have put a password on it which is used to encrypt the file. This will stop casual snoopers though it can't really stop a dedicated attacker.

- The other thing is most people find it easier to secure tangible things than intangible ones. They are used to protecting documents and paper currency notes.

- The most important reason is that remote attackers find it easier to hack into computers or cloud accounts than to physically break into your home. So the seed on paper is supposed to protect you from remote attackers although if you have the wallet file on your PC then it is still vulnerable to such attackers.

As for analog hacks, like someone taking a photo of your paper with seed words:
 - You can write the words down out of order as long as you remember the ordering.  ie.write the words in the odd numbered spots, then continue entering in the even numbered spots.

A bit more information for others:

If using the passphrase feature the Pin you will just store in memory as that is not needed to restore a backup, but if you use the advanced passphrase feature you will need to back this up in memory and best to backup written down as well (paper or metal) . Passphrase should be kept separate than your backup 12/18/24 words. Losing the passphrase means losing your Bitcoin!

It is false to believe that all miners will retire. Only some miners will retire  

If rewards fall for miners, some miners will retire and some will keep mining.

Hashrate would not disappear simply because a certain % of ASICs are unattended and will continue working regardless, and many miners have sunk costs (electrical contracts or upfront renewable energy investment) and will mine regardless for some time even if it is unprofitable. Bitcoin users will still be able to tx on other layers , like offchain, sidechains, eltoo, statechains, and payment channels while blocks are slowly found until difficulty eventually finds a new level where miners are profitable.

698,"Bitcoin mining is the processing of transactions in the digital currency system, in which the records of current Bitcoin transactions, known as a blocks, are added to the record of past transactions, known as the block chain.

A Bitcoin is defined by the digitally signed record of its transactions, starting with its creation. The block is an encrypted hashproof of work, created in a compute-intensive process. Miners use software that accesses their processing capacity to solve transaction-related algorithms . In return, they are awarded a certain number of Bitcoins per block. The block chain prevents attempts to spend a Bitcoin more than once -- otherwise the digital currency could be counterfeited by copy and paste.

Originally, Bitcoin mining was conducted on the CPUs of individual computers, with more cores and greater speed resulting in more profitability. After that, the system became dominated by multi-graphic cardssystems, then field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAS) and finally application-specific integrated circuits (Asics), in the attempt to find more hashes with less electrical power usage. 

Due to this constant escalation, it has become hard for prospective new miners to start. This adjustable difficulty is an intentional mechanism created to prevent inflation. To get around that problem, individuals often work in mining pools.

Bitcoin generally started with individuals and small organizations mining. At that time, start-up could be enabled by a single high-end gaming system. Now, however, larger mining organizations might spend tens of thousands on one high-performance, specialized computer.

**Samourai** This has been my prefered mobile wallet for a while. Its pretty feature rich and privacy focused. What makes this app shine is coin control. Meaning, you can see each of your UTXOs that comprise your wallet balance and mark each one as spendable, or not spendable. Something that people may not like is that there is no fiat denomination so it doesn't show what your wallet is worth in fiat but you get used to it. Also it may be a bit overwhelming to see a handful of features with fancy names like Ricochet, Stonewall, Whirlpool, Paynims that might take a while to understand. I generally reccomend you use a simpler wallet if its your first time.

**Blockstream Green**: Simple, easy to use. This wallet has a great 2FA feature that if you decide to use requires you to verify with either email, sms, call, or the  Google Authenticator app every time you send a transaction. This is done using a 2 of 2 multisig where blockstream has access to to the other key. Also has a connect via Tor option. Has a great intuitive UX.

**Electrum**: Not as many features as their desktop version but still pretty great. Features 2FA using 2 of 3 multisig. A key on your phone, a key hidden away, and a key with a service called TrustedCoin. Everytime you make a transaction you will need to verify with google authenticator linked to TrustedCoin's server. You still have two keys, so if TrustedCoin disappears or is hacked you still have control of your funds.

> Once the purchase is made and they are all coinjoined, I want to send them back to the trezor.

788,"1) For new users its typically wiser to start with a hardware wallet. electrum works great with either one. You do not need a more expensive Model T either if trying to save money. Any HW wallets listed in item 3 would be just as good and coldcard with PSBTs would be slightly more secure as you eliminate concerns with receiving a tampered HW wallet

Technically, HW wallets are not cold storage if they are ever connected to a device with internet connectivity. They are quasi cold storage insomuch as they allow you to securely transact on insecure devices where all tx signing occurs in the  HW wallet and your private keys don't leave it. Using cold card HW wallet without  even  connecting it to another device with PSBTs is an example of true cold storage . 

If you want to make some secure cold storage HW wallets are also a great tool in doing so. Make your coldstorage wallets(12 , 18 or 24 words) , test them , than reset the HW wallet and use  it as a ""hot wallet"" for spending smaller amounts

a) At minimum make sure you install from a trusted repo or source -

-------------------------------

Other tips - 

Do not keep your HW wallet in the same location as your backup words
The HW wallet itself doesn't need to be hidden except if you are trying to limit the amount of people who know you have Bitcoin in the first place because it protected by a pin and or passphrase where wrong entries delay retries exponentially and/or reset the HW wallet after a while.

Thus the focus should be on securing the BIP39 backup words .

1) Do not store these digitally

2) Never write down the pin or passphrase together with the 12/18/24 words

3) At minimum secure the backup 12/18/24 words on paper in a sealed plastic bag to protect against moisture or flooding. Do not laminate as certain adhesives can damage the ink.

4) If you can afford , upgrade to a metal backup (steel , copper brass... but aluminum is unacceptable)

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test/

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test--part-ii-/

5) Keep backup private and secure , whoever gets a hold of this can steal your BTC!

6) Pin you will just store in memory as that is not needed to restore a backup, but if you use the advanced passphrase feature you will need to back this up in memory and best to backup written down as well (paper or metal) . Passphrase should be kept separate than your backup 12/18/24 words

http://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-faq/threats.html#reflashing-the-trezor-with-evil-firmware

2) Upgrade the firmware 

3) Create a wallet and backup the seed physically(not digitally) 

4) Send a small test amount of BTC to HW wallet 

5) After confirmed for a little amount of time, reset the HW wallet and than recover it with seed words to learn the process and be extra confident the seed words are correct

I don't see this ever happening, nor would we want it to occur. There are too many Bitcoin users and developers who are aware how insecure and pointless Proof of Stake is. 

Here are the details as to why-

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9v9eum/i_think_im_late_to_ask_but_will_bitcoin_ever_have/e9agq68/

Proof of stake would not even be wise to add as an additional security mechanism either. When designing security architecture it is usually the case that using 2 solutions gives you the consequences and costs of both. 

Bitcoin already has a Built in indirect PoS regardless. Ultimately economic users control Bitcoin and any misbehavior by the miners will be met with the Users implementing a UASF or UAHF or nuclear  option of changing the PoW algo. Users might take no action for a short 51% attack that is rectified but any deep reorg or continuous 51% attack will force the users to take action manually. This indirect form of PoS is actually more desirable because the attacker does not have certainty before hand how the network will react like with a PoS coin that has this all baked into the code. This uncertainty in the outcome of an attack makes the attack less likely to be initiated and if done more difficult to carry out as the attacker is dealing with a spontaneous thinking and adjusting organism(the intelligentsia of all Bitcoin users)",,,,,,
817,"PoS is never going to happen because it's not safe. 

Changes do take place but at a glacial pace. Right now they are working on adding schnorr signatures to bitcoin. You can keep up to date via [this site](https://bitcoinops.org/). There's also work happening on layer 2 i.e. lightning. That is by separate teams though.",,,,,,

A few reasons why. It comes with electrum. You can have a signed system that never touches the internet. It deletes ramdisk multiple times on shutdown. You install to a USB and if you want can create an encrypted section to keep your wallet, or you can use your current plan and restore from seed in the future.

My only suggestion would be to consider using a BIP39 seed phrase. The reason for that is that it allows you to both use Electrum (which also supports BIP39 phrases) in the online/offline mode that you have suggested (which is great) and also gives you the option to import it into a hardware wallet in the future if you decide that you want something simpler but still secure to access your funds. I cover a bit about how to do that in Tails here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5nejoEGWFw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5nejoEGWFw)

Going the BIP39 route also allows you to secure the seed phrase via a BIP39 passphrase (which also easily lets you do the honeypot thing on the raw seed without passphrase), store additional currencies, etc. There are also tools like BTCRecover that can help you recover your crypto if you have a typo in a single keyword, etc. (Basically there is a whole eco-system of stuff around BIP39 which isn't the case for Electrum's seed phrases) (Video on selecting a good BIP39 passphrase here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhjq\_1J0EbU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhjq_1J0EbU))

1) Never claim an altcoin spinoff with private keys that have btc . tx them off to a new wallet first and never reuse those keys again

2) Don't trust any of this software on your computer or cell phone . Use another computer , linux usb live drive, or VM instance or at least use a separate app 

3) don't use online web wallets to claim

Thus at minimum - 

1) Perform an onchain tx and sweep the private keys(do not import) for your Bitcoin into a wallet you control 

2) After those BTC are in the wallet you desire them to be in , use another wallet to sweep the altcoins like Bcash. Do not use the same wallet. 

3) Once you have the bcash(BCH) you can than decide to send it to a service like https://changelly.com or any other exchange for a quick swap for More real Bitcoin 
 
4) Than you can decide to claim your BSV to sell , and any other UTXo splits - https://blog.bitmex.com/44-bitcoin-fork-coins/
You always claim the highest market cap first, unless you have a lot of BTC its usually not worth it going past BSV

Regarding the ambiguity of our support article that you described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EdgeWallet/comments/dwjrnv/is_sweeping_private_keys_really_a_sweep/), a *sweep* creates a transaction and sends the funds to an address you own. *Import* means to move the private key into you wallet without actually moving any funds. 

For bitcoin and bitcoin-related currencies, Edge supports sweeping only and the app doesn't support using a custom fee when sweeping. The app support importing for account based currencies only, like XLM, ETH, and XRP.

Well giving BTC as a present makes it a bit less easy.  You will want to store the BTC in an address then give your nephew the keys.  Easiest way to do that is to use a wallet like r/Coinomi or r/ExodusWallet that support BIP39.  Many may suggest r/Electrum, but they [don't support BIP39](https://old.reddit.com/r/Electrum/comments/dld22r/help_generate_bip39_seed_and_wallets_from/).  Once you create the wallet put the 12 words (the seed), the passphrase and the derivation path in a greeting card and send it to him.

***MOST*** important is to keep the seed, passphrase and derivation path for the rest of your life.  You will likely get a call in 10 or 20 years from your nephew asking if you still have them.  If bitcoin has a 100x expansion it will sour your relationship with your nephew if you can restore his $5000 in BTC.

> The places I’ve looked at so far seem to require SSN, government IDs, and all other types of stuff.

That's the law in the US.

Compliance with law is always optional.  People speed and jaywalk all the time.

> I’d rather not give that type of personal info to some random websites.

1) Blockchain.com is both an online and cell wallet but allows you to buy BTC and other coins from within so the scammer can help you setup the wallet and get you to buy as well without using a separate exchange on a compromised account

2) Since blockchain.com is web based they can help you set it up and secretly setup a backdoor or steal your seed keys with remote software like anydesk or teamviewer unlike a cell phone software which is more difficult. 

3) There is a user name and password for this wallet so this gives the scammer an opportunity to tell the user that they can change the password later and they still can have access via the seed or backdoor mentioned in item 4

4) They have an alternative backdoor that is misleading because a scammer can choose to not export the backup phrase and the wallet will tell you that so you think you are safe by simply changing the password , but they use a backdoor feature in blochchain wallet called ""Mobile App pairing code"" . **This means that they can pair their cell phone and steal the BTC at anytime in the future with this pairing code even if you change the passcode and they don't have your backup words**",,,,,,

**Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro vs Cash App** 
-------------------------------------------

All these companies are insured and very easy to setup and verify with great UX. Due to its simplicity Cash App is a little easier to use out of the 3. All these methods require AML/KYC verification, cash app delays this until you withdraw the BTC.

**Coinbase.com**

**Pros**-- Easier to Use than coinbase pro. Allows you to lock in a price (but have to wait ~1 week) for BTC to be released which is helpful during a bull market.  

**Cons**

Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1KwAZKGts, ~1 week delay on withdrawing Bitcoin, more complex to use than cash app, highest fees with 1.49 % bank transfer and 3.99% debit card fees, overcharges on withdrawal fees or onchain transactions 

-------------------------

**Pro.Coinbase.com**

**Pros**-- Lowest fees of the 3 when you use a buy limit order = 0.5%, unlike coinbase pays for your onchain withdrawal fee(But the week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on fiat arriving preventing buying can make you lose BTC unlike the other 2)

**Cons**

Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1KwAZKGts, ~1 week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on depositing fiat with bank transfers before you can buy BTC, most complex to use of all 3

-------------------------

**Square Cash App**

https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/1016-bitcoin

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/square-cash/id711923939?mt=8

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareup.cash&referrer=utm_source%3Dcash-web-bitcoin%26utm_medium%3Dweb


**Pros**-- Easiest to use of the 3, Best alignment with Bitcoin politically, Allows you to lock in the price immediately and withdraw quickly(once verified), No fees to buy Bitcoin or withdraw bitcoin

**Cons**-- Only available in USA, despite having no fees their spread is slightly wider thus making them slightly more expensive that coinbase pro typically

-------------------


Cash App charges no fee but has a larger spread of ~1.6% compared to coinbase pro on average. Thus you will pay 1.45% more than coinbase pro. The retail side of Coinbase allows you to buy with 1.49% with an ACH but will typically make you wait a 7-10 days to withdraw your BTC. This rate might seem cheaper than cash app but their spread is different in the retail side(coinbase.com) thus it comes out to around the same rate or slightly worse than cash app. Cash app allows you to withdraw BTC much quicker than coinbase as well.

Thus , if you want to wait a week you can save a dollar , but also likely buy BTC at a more expensive amount in a bull market.

------------------------

**TL;DR**

Good idea to setup an account with either ""Cash app and coinbase pro"" or ""gemini and cash app"" if you are in the USA. Unless you live outside the USA , you should never use regular coinbase due to the fees. 

Use cash app during a bull market where you need to instantly lock in the price. Perhaps use coinbase pro in a Bear market where the delay won't hurt you or if you need to sell some Bitcoin.

**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange. You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys. After buying your bitcoin withdraw them to your personal wallet**",,,,,,

**TRADING**
 

Welcome to the hardest game in the world.  
Unfortunately, you're playing with some of the sharpest, fastest, most intelligent,
well informed, stubbornly irrational and in many cases, unethical minds in the world.

You're up against the computer that can react faster than you.  
The trader who has more experience than you.  
The fund that has more money than you. 
The insider that has more information than you.  
The others that will misinform you. 
The inner voice that will do it's best to undo you.

So, leave all your dreams of making quick and easy money, behind.

The first aim is survival.  
Your absolute first goal is to learn how to stay in the game.

You can only do this by mapping the territory.  
By understanding how the enemy thinks and acts.  
By having a solid game plan.  
And by picking your battles very, very carefully.

1071,"Not really, as the tools to use GPUs exist in the wild too.

You also need to ask yourself why those miners who are currently making a profit want to share the mining reward with those who don't have access to specialised hardware and cheap power.",,,,,,
1072,"I feel like the other comments are not answering your question but challenging it. So, to answer literally : Yes, if you reduce the computational power, the difficulty will adjust.

The example you chose to illustrate your question makes no sense.  ""Agreeing to reduce the difficulty"" is unsafe for the network, useless for the miners, and bad for the users.

An other example could be : If a destructive event obliged the biggest mining hubs to close down (china, czetch). May it be a war, a natural disaster, or a Celine Dion concert. Would the difficulty go down enough that you could get rich with your 2008 laptop ? 

No, because if the economy of Bitcoin relies on your crappy Celeron CPU, then Bitcoin is highly unsafe and  nobody with any sort of financial education should take such risk. You will mine bitcoin, but they will be worth nothing.",,,,,,
1073,"Theoretically it is possible that the whole network runs on three laptops.

1075,"Your suggestion is ignoring the fact that the energy efficiency is much, much worse using CPU or GPU for bitcoin mining. The current generation of ASICs is not only billions of times faster than a general purpose processor, but also billions of times more energy efficient  
Therefore, the most likely outcome of a mass agreement to downgrade to laptops is the same amount of energy producing much fewer hashes  

The most effective trigger to lowering energy usage is to lower the reward below the cost of mining. The Bitcoin reward is halved every 210000 blocks, but the energy cost is not measured in Bitcoin. If the Bitcoin price falls substantially and permanently then power usage will fall in proportion  

Similarly, on the cost side, if power prices increase, there will be less power consumed by Bitcoin mining",,,,,,

The prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher while working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it ""prisoner's dilemma"", presenting it as follows:



Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other.

The simplest answer is to get a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger. Each of these support bitcoin and ethereum already.

If you want to make your own cold storage wallet for bitcoin I recommend creating a live USB containing Tails OS. This already has electrum bitcoin wallet included. At the login screen you can go to options and disable internet, then login. You create and use the wallet in this offline environment. You can copy the wallet's master public key to an online device with electrum to track your balance and create transactions to be signed offline. Usually this is done by scanning QR codes between the two devices.

Edit: by default the Tails live USB deletes your session at shutdown. You can either create an encrypted space (tool included in Tails, do this on first boot, then restart unlocking it) or you can let it be deleted and restore from seed on a future use.",,,,,,

I do not care if is for a good cause or salvation of humanity. My BTC are MY BTC.  
Why? Simple:  
1. My BTC are earned hard, for the past 8 years.  
2. Each one of my BTC means MY FREEDOM. Each time I would ""give"" (for nothing) to somebody I would give a part of my freedom. Freedom is very hard to earn nowadays. Who want it should work hard for it.  
3. Nowadays, BTC gets too valuable to be given for free. Those times when everybody were throwing around with BTC are GONE.  
4. All these ""donations"" pledges are mostly scams, begging for obscure sites, that absolutely nobody can track where the money goes or how they are used.  
5. If I really want to help a person in need I will do it directly and in private, not through any bloodsucker false ""organization"" or ""foundation"".  
6. Any of these cases for donations are in fact the result of fucking bad govs and banksters plans to decimate/enslave people. These should be the ones to pay for any disaster, crime, people in need, because they are the ones that created in the first place, not me.

59,">Do your worst!

You're describing a situation where a significant proportion of the world (including, presumably, the country of China) has bought into bitcoin. Bitcoin would have succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of most here. Hurray!

So that out of the way, you then hypothesise that one participant in this economy decides to trash it - oh no! - what then, Bitcoiners???

Well, you have to explain what this has to do with bitcoin. China could easily play such games right now, if it wanted. But it wisely doesn't want to because of the certain damage it would sustain, plus the uncertain (but surely belligerent) reaction it would garner from the famously bellicose western military-industrial machine.",,,,,,

France sold a lot of gold around 2000 (probably impacting its price) but good luck to get it back now... and unfortunately for them, gold will  probably be dearly needed sooner than later",,,,,,

The ***could***.  But they ***could*** also launch a bunch of nukes in an effort to destabilize global economies.  Or they ***could*** flood the market with US treasuries to collapse the dollar.

There are much easier ways to mess with countries than cornering the crypto market.  Most would have much bigger tidal waves than a BTC crash.

# For Beginners and Other Curious Creatures: A Gentle Introduction To Bitcoin

&#x200B;

**What is Bitcoin?  It is a new kind of money.**   Actually, it's just an old kind of money you're already familiar with,  but with certain improvements.  It turns out this new, improved money  has some very important properties which make Bitcoin one of the most  important inventions of all time.

At it's heart, **Bitcoin is a ledger --**  a list of transactions.  That's it.  A transaction is an event where a  person sends 'money' from one 'account' to another.  The transactions  are stored in the order in which they occurred.  The ledger is stored on  computers.

If you've ever used a  check (a paycheck, for example), or a credit card you've already used  'money' in the form of a ledger stored on computers.

So, **what makes Bitcoin different?**   Bitcoin's ledger is stored on many thousands of computers, spread  across the globe.  Anybody is free to participate.  The computers all  use the same set of 'rules' to keep the Bitcoin ledger honest, fair, and  accurate.  The rules also specify precisely how, and how much new  'money' is to be created and to whom it will belong upon its creation.   With checks and credit cards, the ledgers are kept in a relatively small  number of computers owned and operated by banks.

**Bitcoin 'money' is very, very difficult and expensive to create.**  The number of Bitcoins is strictly limited -- **there will never be more than 21 million**  Bitcoins created.  Many have already been lost forever.  This makes  each and every Bitcoin rare, and precious -- like gold, only better.   Bank ledgers keep track of fiat money.  **Fiat money is created from thin air, by merely typing numbers into a bank computer**;  fiat money is not backed by gold or anything else; fiat money is even  less precious than ""play money"" you'd find in the toy aisle of the  dollar store.  Fiat money loses value over time as the banking system  creates more and more of it.  Bitcoin gains value over time because  demand rises (as more people understand its goodness) while the supply  is strictly limited.

**Newly created Bitcoin money goes, as a reward, to people who earned it** by protecting the Bitcoin ledger (enforcing its rules, for example).  This is fair, honest, and good.  **Newly created fiat money goes to bankers and then to their cronies.**   That's right: we have a very small group of people with the ability to  create 'money' from nothing and then use it to enrich and empower  themselves and their cronies **at the expense of everybody else**,  including (but not limited to) elderly blind widows.  It turns out that  creating fiat money and using it (to buy things, to bail our broke  banks and businesses, to bribe politicians) amounts to theft.

Fiat money is inherently flawed, dishonest, unfair, bad...

**Bitcoin is honest, fair, and good.**

Furthermore,  the banks can and will cut people off from being able to use their  ledgers/fiat-money system when a government tells them to do so.  This  has already happened to whistle blowers, dissidents, and even entire  nations.  Fiat money is not only used to rob ordinary people, it is also  used as a 'weapon'.  Bitcoin is open to everybody.  Bitcoin cannot be  coerced to ""sanction"" people (whether they deserve it or not).  In  short, fiat money supports violence and theft whereas Bitcoin promotes  harmony, peace, and fairness via ""sound money"".

You are invited to join us.  So, if you're interested...

**Welcome to Bitcoin.**  I would like to encourage you to spend a little more time learning about it.  Here's an excellent video to explain the basics:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4)

109,"The miners are hashing a bunch of data (relating to the most recent block, and the potential new block), plus a number (the 'nonce'), trying to produce a hash that begins with *at least* certain number of zeroes (more zeroes as difficulty goes up). Every time they try & fail, they change the nonce & try again. The number of zeroes required is automatically adjusted to keep blocks coming every 10 minutes, on average.

When a miner eventually succeeds in finding such a hash, they submit it to the network for validation. Assuming it is valid, all the other miners then begin again, looking for the next block in the same way. The successful miner is rewarded with newly minted bitcoin (currently 12.5 btc per block), plus transaction fees.",,,,,,
110,"Every time a block is validated, the person who contributed the necessary computational power is given a block reward in the form of new-minted BTC and transaction fees.

&#x200B;

Transaction fees are issued to miners as an incentive to continue validating the network. By the time 21 million BTC has been minted, transaction volume on the network will have increased significantly and miners' profitability will remain roughly the same.",,,,,,
111,"you need to understand nonce, hashing and merkle trees, to explain it properly. otherwise you're doing your students a disservice.",,,,,,
112,No miners calcuate functions to run the network and process transactions. They are rewarded new bitcoin on the network as a reward to processing information for the bitcoin ledger,,,,,,
113,"As from your own explanation, doesn't look you are a ""computer science"" teacher, but just a poor student.  
A teacher, even after reading quickly the [Satoshi's papers](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) will understand and be able to explain in few words, how Bitcoin mining works.  

Here is a list of many **Academic research** documents, for studying: https://cdecker.github.io/btcresearch/",,,,,,
114,"Ohhhh so it's like when a child finds a lizard in the backyard and you can tell it - if you can find its tail, you get to keep the lizard? Is that kind of like how miners mine a nonce?",,,,,,

You race to the bathroom and disrobe, fearing the financial exile and destitution that will surely follow if you do not satisfy Lord Cheeto immediately. As you start snapping shots of your plastic-injected body, you get a text from Ivanka telling you she just dropped a cool 15 mil on a solid gold vibrator and wants to get you one. Suddenly realizing you haven't sent the pics yet, you fire them off and hope it's enough to keep Mango Man busy while you inform your daughter that you do, in fact, want one and ask her to buy it immediately.

Ok so Barron is the unconfirmed transactions, Donald Trump is the blockchain, Melania is the PoW required to satisfy the nonce and I have completely forgotten where I was going with this",,,,,,

179,"Most online places require you to be 18+ to start an account.  So one option would be to have someone you trust purchase them and then transfer them to a wallet that you control.  You might be able to find a bitcoin ATM that will let you purchase with a debit card, there is usually a premium added on those so make sure the price is reasonable.",,,,,,
180,"If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

You indicated that you would like to maintain your financial privacy (i.e., by not revealing your age), and that you would like to pay using either debit card or PayPal.  

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card.  I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., Rebiton [**NO-KYC**], CoinCorner [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], CEX.io, Coinify, Jubiter, Bittylicious, BitIreland, Kuna.io Money, LiteBit.eu, Conio.com, GetSatsoshi.org ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), Cash App and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

There are also physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  <-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:   There are some sellers on No-KYC P2P exchanges that accept PayPal, others that accept debit card, etc. 

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro  <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).   These methods will likely require identity verification / KYC though.

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method.  These methods will likely all require identity verification/KYC.

There's always the friends and family methods.  Someone you know probably holds bitcoin and would be willing to help you out by selling to you.",,,,,,
181,"There are only a few exchanges that accept PayPal due to it being easily reversed:

- xCoins.io
- VirWOX
- CanCoin.com
- Upcoin.com
- eToro: You can fund an account on eToro and buy a bitcoin position.  But you cannot withdraw those bitcoins, and instead you can only later sell and withdraw the cash (including trading gains, or minus trading losses).

183,"**Credit card**

A credit card is a payment card issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts plus the other agreed charges. The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance.

A credit card is different from a charge card, which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers to build a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged.

189,"My [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e08atv/why_use_hardware_wallets_over_paper_wallets/f8cp8da/) to a similar question

***

Most risk isn't in storing the seed... its recovering the seed.  Any time a private key is given to an operating system you are at risk until the funds that key is releasing are confirmed in a block.  You may have mad ninja skill OPSEC, but I always assume that no computer or OS (even tails or Raspbian) is secure.  Maybe it's secure enough for a $100 UTXO, or a $1000 UTXO.  But what happens in 50 years when those UTXOs are worth millions.

When you use Raspbian, you basically say ""I trust the guys that developed this not to steal my keys"" or at least ""I trust random strangers to read all their code and validate it"".  Problem is that Raspbian is literally millions of lines of code.  Something like coldcard and trezor are 100x or 1000x smaller codebase.  Less code to attack, less code to review.  Higher confidence.

In my opinion... The two things a HW wallet does better than anything else are:

1. Generating a seed in a way that is disguised from the operating system.
2. Using a key to sign a TXN in a way that is disguised from the operating system.

For the years that your HOLDring , I think it matters not whether that thing in your safety depoist box is a laminated paper wallet or a laminated seed, passphrase, derivation-path.

PS... Shamir's Shared Secret is also cool.",,,,,,
190,"Even an old smartphone, kept offline can do exactly the same what is doing a HW.  
You could create the tx offline, sign it, on any wallet that support that feature. Then take the tx signed, paste it in a txt file that you can open it in whatever other wallet and broadcast it.  
You could send the txt through Bluetooth or Wifi share between 2 phones (one offline, one online).  

I consider HW just a fancy way to keep your keys away from online. That's it. Is not rocket science.",,,,,,

Why? Simple:  
1. My BTC are earned hard, for the past 8 years.  
2. Each one of my BTC means MY FREEDOM. Each time I would ""give"" (for nothing) to somebody I would give a part of my freedom. Freedom is very hard to earn nowadays. Who want it should work hard for it.

After they finish accumulating, they will destabilise the economy and promote bitcoin as the invention of the century, find some political/ideological excuse for why it shouldn't be taxed (i.e. ""If we tax bitcoin, all the trade will move to china and the communist party will become rich!""), and those rich people will brag over how they were so smart to see the future and accumulate secretly.

You barely hear them saying anything in favour of bitcoin, and you barely hear them saying anything against bitcoin.

269,"Just means the bitcoin market and price discovery mechanism are maturing.    

Bakkt's bitcoin-settled futures product is particularly of interest because it is less able to create short-term ""manipulations"" of bitcoin's spot price on exchanges.  This is because bets placed on bitcoin which don't involve trading actual bitcoin can be much larger than the relatively small bitcoin market overall can handle in terms of liquidity on exchanges.  So because bitcoin is a small market compared to other legacy markets, and compared to the wealth held by top global investors, this means bitcoin's spot exchange price can be ""manipulated"" short term by placing large bets in the cash-settled futures, and derivative markets, and only needing to place a relatively small trade on a major bitcoin exchange to temporarily move the price a large enough amount to make huge profits on their derivative trade (since derivative market contracts are based on bitcoin spot price).      

The unfortunate catch is that powerful legacy traders actually like to be able to manipulate in this way, so they have no interest in bitcoin-settled futures.  That's why it's good to see the bitcoin-settled futures increasing in volume.  Really though, Bakkt's bitcoin-settled futures product should just be seen as another bitcoin exchange in terms of its ""influence"".   

  Ideally what we want to see is the liquidity in bitcoin-settled futures, and the liquidity in spot bitcoin exchange grow to counter-act the manipulative power the derivatives market currently has.    

It's growing pains of an immature market, and immature price discovery mechanism.",,,,,,

case in point, if a citizen of china sends btc to a us citizen, are we saying that bitcoin was transferred from china to us? Their legal framework and its reality exists outside of bitcoin.

We're all counting up to 21 million along an agreed trajectory, and new coins are created at the moment of mining provided it is the expected amount.",,,,,,

308,"No they don’t even exist. They are generated as a reward for miners. Whichever miner solves the block (or whichever mining pool, more realistically these days), is rewarded with 12.5BTC. The first transaction in a block is called a ‘coinbase’ transaction and adds 12.5BTC to their wallet. This is NOT sent from another wallet, but simply generated afresh. 

Imagine mining for gold except the gold wasn’t actually in the ground until you found it. Freaky huh. 

Any attempt to include more than 12.5 BTC in the coinbase transaction will result in the block being rejected by nodes, and whichever other miner provides a correct block with the correct coinbase amount will be accepted.",,,,,,

315,"MY favorite answer so far, other answers touched on this but you explained the mining and reward of 12.5....no one wants to go through the work to mine or find the block then overvalue it like an asshole and be rejected by the community. 

&#x200B;

Quick question:

&#x200B;

are there a certain number of blocks to be mined? or infinite available and a certain amount to be filled for a particular chain...for example, If i mine a block and try to make it worth 100 bitcoin and it gets rejected by nodes, do you then have a chance to remine the same block i mined and mis-priced or do you find/create/mine another available block and price it right thus reserving one of the finite blocks in the chain?  IF it doesnt work anything like this, i wont have my feelings hurt to hear that answer either lol",,,,,,

318,It kind of is like that. Computers are competing with each other to solve a mathematical puzzle sort of. That’s not a perfect analogy but it suffices to explain it. Those with more computational power are more likely to solve a block than those with less.,,,,,,

But, that is assuming that you don't have insurance to repay the loss.  Also, if the amount of taxes were announced as owed, that would mean the loss a few days later would be applied to next years net income, so it wouldn't effect the taxes already owed and especially would NOT be a one-to-one write-off of current taxes owed.

One business has a quarterly revenue of $19 million dollars, another which considers itself a competitor has revenue that barely clears $7 thousand dollars in the same quarter with significantly fewer users and very significantly lower revenue per user. Both currently have vaguely similar operating expenses but latter has increased upside risk for its future operating expenses. The second business has no demonstrated argument how it will overcome the fact that its primary differentiator essentially guarantees extremely low revenue per user. 

Which of these businesses is likely more valued by its customers? Which of these businesses appear to be more viable?

Bitcoin isn't a business-- for sure, but no effort of man is shielded from economic realities. Bitcoin has a demonstrated viable model for paying the considerable cost of security without demanding inflation while staying decentralized. ""Cryptocurrencies"" that promote themselves on free or almost free transactions sacrifice security, decentralization, or both. ... and if someone wants to user a currency that isn't cryptographically secure or decentralized-- and many people do-- there are plenty of widely adopted traditional financial networks.",,,,,,

I chucked this all into OpenSCAD and added a small foot, and job done. If it helps, here is the OpenSCAD source code for the dishwasher foot:

    use <Threading.scad>

    thread_diameter = 17.5;
    thread_pitch = 4;
    thread_windings = 19;
    foot_height = 10;

        cylinder(d=14.5, h=82);

To render it in OpenSCAD, you will need to download the library I linked above, and place the two .scad files (naca_sweep and threading) into your [OpenSCAD libraries directory](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Libraries#Library_Locations).

I didn't expect this but it's really difficult to refuse, thank you very much!

63,"So, I've been thinking a lot about this lately. I like some of the UX stuff in the Nano camp a lot (brainblocks and Natrium especially). However, I have serious doubts about the ""feeless"" concept in the long term. There is an inescapable physical limit on transaction throughput, because bandwidth between nodes is not infinite.

In economic terms, this means that nano transaction throughput is a scarce resource with no price. It seems abundant enough for now that there is never congestion, but what happens if someone wants to build a high-throughput application on top of Nano? Suppose a streaming service (like maybe Spotify) wanted to use it to charge per-second of play time? It would only take 10,000 simultaneous listeners to overwhelm the network and cause massive congestion.

A fee system is necessary in order to let people who most need that bandwidth to bid for it when it becomes scarce. There's no need to artificially limit the throughput, as happens on BTC. But there is a need for the market to be able to bid for resources in order to allocate them most effectively in the event that they become scarce. By completely omitting this mechanism, I think Nano is leaving itself vulnerable to a serious problem.

Perhaps the proof-of-work anti-spam system is enough to solve this? It depends on the extent to which it enables effective market ""bidding"" with higher proof-of-work in the event of congestion.

Also there's the concern that Nano's voting system doesn't allow nodes to independently verify which fork was chosen if they were not online to witness the vote in real time. This is a problem Nano shares with various proof-of-stake coins, and you may or may not consider it a significant issue. But the point is that there are some areas where the design of BCH has advantages over Nano. Nano hasn't made BCH entirely obsolete.",,,,,,

Another way to look at it is that you'll pay 16x the fee (16sat/byte for Bitcoin, 1 sat/byte for bch) **but your asset is worth 34.9x more.**  And the Bitcoin chain is **also 40.67x** more secure than the bch chain going by hash rate.

Even today, if a new account asks the obvious ""no-no"" question of ""Why didn't we choose SegWit over a simple blocksize increase"", they get censored and banned rather than have someone dig up the truth that they're trying to bury. They want that part of Bitcoin to be old history that's not mentioned like some faux-pas. How dare a new user ask why SegWit isn't giving Bitcoin low fees as promised?",,,,,,

215,thats not how RBF signalling works. A transaction inherits RBF of unconfirmed parents.,,,,,,
216,"This is a well known property of blockchain and 0-conf transactions. It's always possible to create two different transactions spending the same output and broadcast these two variants to the network (sometimes it's even a part of the wallet UX). Whenever a miner receives these two different conflicting transactions, he needs to pick one of these transactions to include in a block. And he may:

  * Prefer the first seen transaction.

  * Prefer the transaction, which pays more fees.

  * Respect a hint from the user (RBF flag).

BCH does not support the RBF flag, so miners only have a choice between the first two options. And

 * in some cases BCH miners prefer the first seen transaction: https://i.imgur.com/nYwQObc.png

 * In the other cases BCH miners prefer transactions which pay more fees: https://i.imgur.com/GgAzGUI.png

Everything is up to each individual miner and his own policy. So if they like BCH, then they may prefer to respect the first seen rule. But if they don't like BCH and only care about their own profits, then they may just take a higher fee. I'm not sure why BCH miners are even supposed to like BCH, considering that the BCH community has a habit of regularly [celebrating and gloating about miner misfortunes](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/d8rlix/bitcoin_core_btc_store_of_value_coin_dropped/).




So is there anything that can be done about 0-conf double spends? Yes, of course:

 * BTC has already successfully solved it by deploying the Lightning Network, which is now a preferable payment method for retail merchants.

 * BCH is planning to solve it by eventually introducing pre-consensus and has two competing proposals for this (avalanche and storm).",,,,,,
217,"Please take sometime to read the article. Checking the tx itself (whether it is RBF or not) doesn't work.

As outlined in the article, if the parent of tx is RBF, tx itself need not be RBF and still can be double spend",,,,,,

Your attack doesn't work, so why would I owe you money? Like seriously. And bustabit does support 0-conf if you click on ""precredit"" next to the unconfirmed transaction. But it only supports non-rbf transactions, which by definition the transaction is if the parent is an unconfirmed rbf.",,,,,,

Under Federal explosives laws, all persons who wish to manufacture, import, or distribute explosives, including EPCDs, must acquire a Federal explosives license, and those who wish to receive explosives must acquire a Federal explosives permit. ATF license and permit requirements may be found on ATF’s website at https://www.atf.gov/content/explosives/explosives-industry/how-become-federal-explosives-licensee-FEL. In addition to an ATF Form 5400.13 — Application for Explosives License or Permit, and the application fee, applicants must submit a 2″ x 2″ photograph and a completed FD-258, Fingerprint Identification Card (obtainable through a local law enforcement agency) for each Responsible Person (RP). Further, an ATF Form 5400.28 — Employee Possessor Questionnaire, is required for each Employee Possessor (EP). An EP is an individual who has actual or constructive possession of explosive materials during the course of his or her employment with the applicant’s business. Background checks are conducted for all RPs and EPs submitted with an application.

However insomuch as the Scalability Trilemma is a real thing I choose security and scalability and leave decentralization as the 3rd option. IMO decentralization doesn't need to be a religion. We only need enough decentralization to achieve censorship resistance and we're decentralized enough.

With EARTH I want to focus on UX. I don't think that decentralization is at the front of most people's minds w/ regards to a smooth UX. However scalability and security weigh heavily on a user's mind w/ regards to UX.

Governance is also something I'm brainstorming on and DPoW enables a good governance model with staking as well as enabling 3 second block times.

I'm intending to launch an EARTH Consortium of companies which pledge to help develop the ecosystem as well as run nodes. Also there will be an EARTH specification from the beginning and I'll write the reference implementation. Governance w/ a spec and technical consortium will go a long way and are something which is sorely missing from BTC and BCH IMO. (glad to see a spec coming to BCH)

Regarding what type of users this will cater to. My goal is for every person on earth to be able to do 1000 on-chain transactions every day. Cash, tokens and smart-contracts are all first-class citizens on EARTH. Each account gets about 25 \*\*free\*\* transactions every single day and dapp developers can stake tokens to enable further daily free transactions. Along with a 3 second block time EARTH can target the cash UX. 

Solidity is the smart-contract language which I'm launching with so EARTH will have very powerful turing-complete smart contracts as well as non-fungible tokens and crowd sales. There is also a DEX. I think EARTH can position itself at the convergence of the Web, Internet of Things and Blockchain.",,,,,,

405,"> IMO decentralization doesn't need to be a religion.

I'm sure you know as well as anybody decentralization is the reason people got so excited about Bitcoin. Scaling and governance are solved very easily when one removes decentralization. Just hook networked servers to a central processing server, just like VISA, PayPal etc. The reason Bitcoin got saddled with 3-100 etc tps for so long is approving things in a decentralized manner is damn hard and cumbersome. Despite those challenges, which include governance problems too, people still soldier on forward. Why? Because decentralization *is* that valuable.

>I'm intending to launch an EARTH Consortium of companies which pledge to help develop the ecosystem as well as run nodes.

This is exactly what Hashgraph and Facebook's Libra announced.

You have to define sanctions.  If group A decides not to trade with group B, that's not a crime.

Under the definition as applied today in the US, the principle Roger is standing on here is correct -- sanctions are a violent act every bit as much as locking someone in a closet.  Roger is basically stating the obvious.  Often the problem we face in this world is, is we don't have any principles.

Further, it's not the regime that pays the immediate price when a nation-state is sanctioned.  It's the innocents.  There may be a hope that the regime eventually pays a price.  But that does not change the fact that sanctions punish innocent people.  Sanctions have actually starved millions.  Check into democide.

In terms of reducing block propagation inefficiency, there is this really cool tech called graphene which reduces found block size by 99.9% (the concept is that when a block is found, all other miners already have most of the tx in their mempools and don't need to download them).

For Graphene to work, we needed a way for miners to agree on a universal way to order transactions. The solution picked was CTOR (which you can look up) or canonical transaction ordering. This was merged and adopted in the November 2018 upgrade.

There's also progress in the node software, but from different angles.

The irony of you using this quote this astounding when you actually support a chain that allegedly can support 32MB blocks but has a median blocksize of [0.05MB in the recent months](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/charts/median-block-size?granularity=month).

This is **640x** what is currently used on BCH, after more than two years of *activity* and so-called adoption. This is blatant ""premature optimization"". And to reach this alleged capacity BCH has made compromises in the eligible locations and the minimum hardware requirements to be able to run a node to actually verify the transactions you receive... without actually needing it at all. So while optimizing a side of the currency, it degraded other fundamental features of it. This quote is true and applies to BCH, but not in the positive manner you think.

Oh and when I said ""allegedly"" for the 32MB, I'm referring to the fact that it was only reached during a test in production, for 5 (almost) consecutive blocks and pretty much served the purpose of showing that it caused problems for many implementations and that many miners still had soft limits in place because they most likely cannot handle this limit at all.",,,,,,

Of course you didn't reach them, you're currently providing 640x the necessary resources without justification for the compromises you've made to do it. Even providing 100x would be unreasonable considering the compromises in question.

Blockstream kicking Gavin, the lead Bitcoin developer, out of Bitcoin development, successfully hijacked control over the Bitcoin github.

Mike Hearn and Gavin wanted to prevent Bitcoin from being hijacked, so they created a fork. That fork didn't survived after they were heavily DDOS. Mike Hearn was heavily character assassinated by what I believe to be orchestrated paid campaigns by Blockstream. And of course, now that Mike Hearn is gone, the character assassination campaigns are directed at Bitcoin Cash main supporters like Roger Ver.

Shortly after Blockstream was [incorporated](https://archive.is/qzsVe), they received [$50 million](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/blockstream-series-unknown--66d2817a#section-investors) in venture capital from AXA, Khosla Ventures, Horizon Ventures, etc., some of the most powerful venture firms in the world. The [Blockstream board of directors](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kflur/anybody_ever_find_anything_interesting_in_these/dre1508/) are all bankers.

In the Summer of 2015, all of the primary Bitcoin communities such as /r/Bitcoin, mailing lists, Bitcoin Talk, wikis, etc., began [massive censorship campaigns](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) against any and all topics that had to do with scaling Bitcoin beyond the 1MB limit which, by the way, was temporarily added by Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2010 as a stop-gap measure to prevent spam in the early days.

When you do your own research, you will find that the Bitcoin name and repository were hijacked by a for-profit organisation so they could make a buck on their own patented and convoluted ""solution"" for a problem that doen't even exist (in fact; they themselves created it). In this process, Bitcoin (BTC) was turned into an altcoin by implementing SegWit (the coin itself is no longer a “chain of digital signatures,” as per Fig. 1 of the white paper).

TLDR: [Blockstream fucked Bitcoin over](https://youtu.be/jctc85X_PCI?t=79) and r/Bitcoin bans people talking about it.

Yes, another conspiracy theory, there might be a pattern here if you pay attention... but now let's all completely forget this, this Twitter poll is very helpful and insightful.

64,"So, I've been thinking a lot about this lately. I like some of the UX stuff in the Nano camp a lot (brainblocks and Natrium especially). However, I have serious doubts about the ""feeless"" concept in the long term. There is an inescapable physical limit on transaction throughput, because bandwidth between nodes is not infinite.

In economic terms, this means that nano transaction throughput is a scarce resource with no price. It seems abundant enough for now that there is never congestion, but what happens if someone wants to build a high-throughput application on top of Nano? Suppose a streaming service (like maybe Spotify) wanted to use it to charge per-second of play time? It would only take 10,000 simultaneous listeners to overwhelm the network and cause massive congestion.

A fee system is necessary in order to let people who most need that bandwidth to bid for it when it becomes scarce. There's no need to artificially limit the throughput, as happens on BTC. But there is a need for the market to be able to bid for resources in order to allocate them most effectively in the event that they become scarce. By completely omitting this mechanism, I think Nano is leaving itself vulnerable to a serious problem.

Perhaps the proof-of-work anti-spam system is enough to solve this? It depends on the extent to which it enables effective market ""bidding"" with higher proof-of-work in the event of congestion.

Also there's the concern that Nano's voting system doesn't allow nodes to independently verify which fork was chosen if they were not online to witness the vote in real time. This is a problem Nano shares with various proof-of-stake coins, and you may or may not consider it a significant issue. But the point is that there are some areas where the design of BCH has advantages over Nano. Nano hasn't made BCH entirely obsolete.",,,,,,

Blockstream and Bitcoin Core just shifted Bitcoin from p2p electronic cash to ""Store of Value"" and those who haven't been paying attention or new users asking these obvious questions are silenced rather than being educated. The goal of /r/bitcoin is not to educate new users about Bitcoin but rather to tow the Blockstream line and appear in support of Blockstream's vision for Bitcoin.

Even today, if a new account asks the obvious ""no-no"" question of ""Why didn't we choose SegWit over a simple blocksize increase"", they get censored and banned rather than have someone dig up the truth that they're trying to bury.

217,thats not how RBF signalling works. A transaction inherits RBF of unconfirmed parents.,,,,,,
218,"This is a well known property of blockchain and 0-conf transactions. It's always possible to create two different transactions spending the same output and broadcast these two variants to the network (sometimes it's even a part of the wallet UX). Whenever a miner receives these two different conflicting transactions, he needs to pick one of these transactions to include in a block. And he may:

  * Prefer the first seen transaction.

  * Prefer the transaction, which pays more fees.

  * Respect a hint from the user (RBF flag).

BCH does not support the RBF flag, so miners only have a choice between the first two options. And

 * in some cases BCH miners prefer the first seen transaction: https://i.imgur.com/nYwQObc.png

 * In the other cases BCH miners prefer transactions which pay more fees: https://i.imgur.com/GgAzGUI.png

Everything is up to each individual miner and his own policy. So if they like BCH, then they may prefer to respect the first seen rule. But if they don't like BCH and only care about their own profits, then they may just take a higher fee. I'm not sure why BCH miners are even supposed to like BCH, considering that the BCH community has a habit of regularly [celebrating and gloating about miner misfortunes](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/d8rlix/bitcoin_core_btc_store_of_value_coin_dropped/).




So is there anything that can be done about 0-conf double spends? Yes, of course:

 * BTC has already successfully solved it by deploying the Lightning Network, which is now a preferable payment method for retail merchants.

 * BCH is planning to solve it by eventually introducing pre-consensus and has two competing proposals for this (avalanche and storm).",,,,,,

Under Federal explosives laws, all persons who wish to manufacture, import, or distribute explosives, including EPCDs, must acquire a Federal explosives license, and those who wish to receive explosives must acquire a Federal explosives permit. ATF license and permit requirements may be found on ATF’s website at https://www.atf.gov/content/explosives/explosives-industry/how-become-federal-explosives-licensee-FEL. In addition to an ATF Form 5400.13 — Application for Explosives License or Permit, and the application fee, applicants must submit a 2″ x 2″ photograph and a completed FD-258, Fingerprint Identification Card (obtainable through a local law enforcement agency) for each Responsible Person (RP). Further, an ATF Form 5400.28 — Employee Possessor Questionnaire, is required for each Employee Possessor (EP). An EP is an individual who has actual or constructive possession of explosive materials during the course of his or her employment with the applicant’s business. Background checks are conducted for all RPs and EPs submitted with an application.

However insomuch as the Scalability Trilemma is a real thing I choose security and scalability and leave decentralization as the 3rd option. IMO decentralization doesn't need to be a religion. We only need enough decentralization to achieve censorship resistance and we're decentralized enough.

With EARTH I want to focus on UX. I don't think that decentralization is at the front of most people's minds w/ regards to a smooth UX. However scalability and security weigh heavily on a user's mind w/ regards to UX.

Governance is also something I'm brainstorming on and DPoW enables a good governance model with staking as well as enabling 3 second block times.

I'm intending to launch an EARTH Consortium of companies which pledge to help develop the ecosystem as well as run nodes. Also there will be an EARTH specification from the beginning and I'll write the reference implementation. Governance w/ a spec and technical consortium will go a long way and are something which is sorely missing from BTC and BCH IMO. (glad to see a spec coming to BCH)

Regarding what type of users this will cater to. My goal is for every person on earth to be able to do 1000 on-chain transactions every day. Cash, tokens and smart-contracts are all first-class citizens on EARTH. Each account gets about 25 \*\*free\*\* transactions every single day and dapp developers can stake tokens to enable further daily free transactions. Along with a 3 second block time EARTH can target the cash UX. 

Solidity is the smart-contract language which I'm launching with so EARTH will have very powerful turing-complete smart contracts as well as non-fungible tokens and crowd sales. There is also a DEX. I think EARTH can position itself at the convergence of the Web, Internet of Things and Blockchain.",,,,,,

407,"> IMO decentralization doesn't need to be a religion.

I'm sure you know as well as anybody decentralization is the reason people got so excited about Bitcoin. Scaling and governance are solved very easily when one removes decentralization. Just hook networked servers to a central processing server, just like VISA, PayPal etc. The reason Bitcoin got saddled with 3-100 etc tps for so long is approving things in a decentralized manner is damn hard and cumbersome. Despite those challenges, which include governance problems too, people still soldier on forward. Why? Because decentralization *is* that valuable.

>I'm intending to launch an EARTH Consortium of companies which pledge to help develop the ecosystem as well as run nodes.

This is exactly what Hashgraph and Facebook's Libra announced.

Cash, tokens and smart-contracts are all first-class citizens on EARTH.

They required you to make a ""request"" for withdrawal, which they claimed all requests would be processed on Sunday's. After sunday passed and my money had not been transferred, I reached out to their support. At the beginning, I was receiving immediate replies. They told me it would be deposited the next sunday, but they also made sure to let me know they had a promotion that would bump up your profit return percentage if investing more then $500 at a time. I talked with them for a while about that, and I TOLD them I was depositing $500 then. Immediately after, I never received a single other reply.

You have to define sanctions.  If group A decides not to trade with group B, that's not a crime.  But economic sanctions today, especially implemented by for example the US, means that group A is corralling its partners and blockading group B to prevent them from trading with others.  That's unjust.

Under the definition as applied today in the US, the principle Roger is standing on here is correct -- sanctions are a violent act every bit as much as locking someone in a closet.  Roger is basically stating the obvious.  Often the problem we face in this world is, is we don't have any principles.

Further, it's not the regime that pays the immediate price when a nation-state is sanctioned.  It's the innocents.  There may be a hope that the regime eventually pays a price.  But that does not change the fact that sanctions punish innocent people.  Sanctions have actually starved millions.  Check into democide.

In terms of reducing block propagation inefficiency, there is this really cool tech called graphene which reduces found block size by 99.9% (the concept is that when a block is found, all other miners already have most of the tx in their mempools and don't need to download them).

For Graphene to work, we needed a way for miners to agree on a universal way to order transactions. The solution picked was CTOR (which you can look up) or canonical transaction ordering. This was merged and adopted in the November 2018 upgrade.

The irony of you using this quote this astounding when you actually support a chain that allegedly can support 32MB blocks but has a median blocksize of [0.05MB in the recent months](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/charts/median-block-size?granularity=month).

This is **640x** what is currently used on BCH, after more than two years of *activity* and so-called adoption. This is blatant ""premature optimization"".

So while optimizing a side of the currency, it degraded other fundamental features of it. This quote is true and applies to BCH, but not in the positive manner you think.

Oh and when I said ""allegedly"" for the 32MB, I'm referring to the fact that it was only reached during a test in production, for 5 (almost) consecutive blocks and pretty much served the purpose of showing that it caused problems for many implementations and that many miners still had soft limits in place because they most likely cannot handle this limit at all.",,,,,,

Of course you didn't reach them, you're currently providing 640x the necessary resources without justification for the compromises you've made to do it. Even providing 100x would be unreasonable considering the compromises in question.

As I said, your quote already applies to BCH, it has demonstrably done premature optimizations. They are not just ""trying to optimize decades early"", they have done it.

It's already plenty enough for them to declare this conspiracy theory true *in their opinion* though.

The most hilarious part is that few days ago the same people were claiming (without any proof obviously) that Twitter as a platform was (also) compromised and should not be used because Jack Dorsey was supposedly involved in the fact that @bitcoin stopped acting as the marketing representative of bitcoin\.com. Yes, another conspiracy theory, there might be a pattern here if you pay attention... but now let's all completely forget this, this Twitter poll is very helpful and insightful.

- enforced subaddresses to further improve user privacy by standardizing transactions

- made massive UX strides on the mobile front with Cake Wallet, Monerujo, and X wallet adding new features, while WooKey Wallet and Coinomi implemented Monero this year

- reduced transaction size and verification time for greater efficiency

Meanwhile $9b in bitcoin value won’t get you anywhere close to $9b in actual value if you try to spend it. 2017 bull run was caused by less than $9b, so imagine how hard it would be to sell/use without demolishing the price.",,,,,,

I'm not going to rehash the arguments of technical developments, or talk about the massive strides in third party industry, or how many generations it logically has to take to switch users to something so very different from what they are used to. This information is readily available. But if you don't take the time or effort to learn, then you probably should not make comments about Bitcoin's lifecycle. Fair? 

I have only been following Bitcoin for a little more than half the time it's existed, but I've worked in the tech industry with networking and IT infrastructure, change management, digital marketing and more for a very long time. 

Bitcoin is just beginning. The problem with complacency is that too many people are too comfortable with the current status quo to be able to see what's coming down the pipe. And with Bitcoin, we have the additional issue of people only seeing the market price, and thinking price up=good, price down=bad. They have no comprehension of this new asset class, not based on any company's financial performance.

In the first 2 years of Bitcoin's existence, there was NO market, and NO market price. NO fiat value at all. Yet it somehow still managed to start catching on, long before there were whales, manipulation, or a crypto market. The total supply ratio is completely 100% irrelevant, because until the day the last coin is mined in 2140, the amount of Bitcoin added to the total supply continues to be reduced. We'll all be long dead by 2140 of course, but the price of a single BTC will likely be so high, that the small percentage of miner fees would be more than adequate incentive and payment.

Lastly, do not underestimate the effect of the next generation raised in a digital society taking over. Digital tokens, gaming currencies, etc., are a very natural course for these future investors. If anyone thinks they will continue to invest in gold dug up from the ground over a digital asset with 24/7 liquidity...they ought to think again.",,,,,,
265,"Ah, you’re right! I thought it was asking what fees would be in terms of fiat. Apologies for the misunderstanding!!",,,,,,
266,"I've been in the space the majority of BTC's lifetime, so that's not an issue. 

>Bitcoin is just beginning.

It's not though, it ending. Again look at the circulating supply compared to it's maximum supply and tell me again that's it's still early. 

>The problem with complacency is that too many people are too comfortable with the current status quo to be able to see what's coming down the pipe.

Sure, but that doesn't mean bitcoin is going to be the new world reserve currency, it's just proof of concept, something to spark new ideas. It's 5-7 TPS can't service a small town, let alone the world. Halving rewards ensures that it would always be top heavy and never adopted by the masses, let along the uber wealthy that bitcoin needs to take off. It also ensures that the network gets weaker if the price doesn't continue to double every few years, again see the point about uber wealthy not buying in and over 85% already pumped out. 

Bitcoin was only ever proof of concept, it was never going to be a serious contender.",,,,,,

285,"Cannot wait to see iota out of top 20. Iota had a seed round of 500k and then evaluated themselves at $1 billion, putting them in top10 and in public eyes. These guy are the stock market equivalent of wework and other startups.  Only that the crpto space is not mature enough to deal with such tactics.

Iota printed money out of thin air and convinced people to invest in them at their obsene evaluation. People who did invest got dumped on by the seed investers who made a killing


Edit: don't confuse seed round with ICO. In ICO's companies set a evaluation of say 30 million. And people give money to the company and get tokens in return.  Ex- EOS had an ICO where they received eth worth $4 billion. 

Iota didn't have an ICO. What they did instead was do a closed seed round.where only few people contributed $500k and then iota said that they were worth $1 billion(and people fell for it). Unlike eos which actually had received money from the public, iota didn't receive $1 billion.

Edit2: wework had received funding of $12 billion and evaluated themselves to $47 billion before reducing it, When people laughed at them. Iota however received funding of $500k,made a evaluation of $1 billion and crypto accepted it.

Just because you’re Bearish and a coward doesn’t mean real investors are. I am more Bullish with every advancement every week and I love these cheap prices as I accumulate a lot more Bitcoins every month. 

Here’s a word from multi-millionaire Hodlers 💦💦

- Tim Draper bought 19000 BTC at $400 and he’s hodling until $250,000 by 2022-2023. He correctly predicted $10,000 BTC when it was only a few hundred dollars and he called it 3 years earlier.

- Trace Mayer, same thing

- DaVinciJ15 owns more than 3000 BTC and purchased at $32, he said the same thing

- Max Keiser bought heaps of Bitcoin at $1 to $5 and he is Hodling until $100,000 and clearly said “There is nothing unique about the number 100k, I only said it back in 2012 to my viewers because it’s a round arbitrary number target”

Arthur Hayes, same thing

Five people who are deep in the industry and worth between $20 million to $1 billion, who all have a track record of being correct many times before.

Being in the top 10 by volume and liquidity means something when the majority of the coins have 0 activity. The price is a result of active participants engaging with the market, rather than just statistical noise.

Liquidity is not the same as daily trading volume. Especially when you account for trans mine chines let exchanges.",,,,,,

If this experiment started in 2013 there would be massive returns by this point.

Anyway, a coin's market cap is just supply × price.

Market cap is the indicator that tells what the whole coin is worth. That's why XRP can be under $1 and still be #3 on total market cap. There's literally over 43 BILLION coins. Compare that to Bitcoin's current 18 million, you can see why the price is different on the scale of thousands of dollars.



As an example to show how market cap changes, imagine I create a coin called Xcel coin. 

There's only 10 in existence. I sell them for $1 a piece. That means my market cap is $10

If the going rate for Xcel coin becomes $1.20, that's a 20% increase, and suddenly market cap is $12. 

If they become worth $100,000 each, then market cap is $1mil.  Etc.",,,,,,

That's not very much but certainly has some activity, which means the floor its at right now still acts as a somewhat valid price support. Order books have depth, and it provides liquidity

Another interesting fact is that all of the tokens that will every be produced are effectively fully distributed, with  93.38% of all outstanding supply held by investors, not founders. There is no real inflation, and is fully distributed, with no hidden inflation that would occur from tokens unlocking (like XRP/XLM, which have significant hidden inflation concerns). Check out their distribution [https://messari.io/asset/iota/profile](https://messari.io/asset/iota/profile) 

All that said, I still don't know what would raise its utility floor from what it is today. Coins like BTC have properties that make people obviously want to hoard it, which pulls from circulating supply available to the market, and it has properties that lock them away like lightning and other 2nd layer protocols. Ethereum and other staking protocols do stuff like this too, and anything with a burn mechanism will help push that price up too. I don't know if users of iota in the IOT network will be forced to hold it, or how the market will end up pricing it. Its hard to say how it will produce any monetary premium other that the fact that the next speculative bubble will push it up, because its clearly being chosen as a speculative asset by the market based on its liquidity, supply distribution and corresponding market cap. I'm not trying to shill, but these are just the objective facts. All I do is include a small percentage of it in my bags because it hits the mark on indices I follow, and if it falls out someday I will not be surprised or butthurt.

I don't remember the exact number, there were 100s, then 1000s entered in 2016, 10 of 1000s in 2017 and then when it was listed it had the valuation the market gave it. Keep in mind that IOTA is one of maybe only 5 serious crypto projects, so it's really no surprise. I would argue that until IOTA is in top 5, the top 20 list is just a random mix of exchange manipulation and marketing, not reflecting anything real in terms of either code, research, executive ability of the team, partnerships or adoption.",,,,,,

Like how did they manipulate the market? Did they spoof their own bitcoin address, faked all the reply’s on the bitcoin forum. What the hell are you talking about and why?

You clearly weren’t around in 2015 but the bitcoin forum was the public portal of cryptocurrency at the time. This is where you made ICO’s public.",,,,,,

But it is not the same for iota. Iota raised $500k of BTC in 2014. Accordingly it should have started with a market cap of 10-20x depending on when the seed round was closed. But it's starting MC was 2000x the amount it raised.",,,,,,

515,"When a CEO leaves their position its generally for one of a few reasons if they are also the founder. (Speaking from experience)

1. They have lost heart in their mission and are giving up.

2. They lack the necessary leadership qualities to drive the business to where it needs to be.

3. The company is performing poorly when the potential of the business is actually high.

I don't know their former CEO obviously, but I hope for holders of WTC that it turns out to be a positive move.",,,,,,

517,"Hello there, I sold my Waltons 2 years ago (at 6$ before the pump to 40$), was a bit salty about it. But now with enough time I can objectively speak my mind.

Hardware related projects are often missunderstood here by the plebs. The difference between a software project and a hw one, is that a software driven project requires a programmer and computer, and generally if a solution exists, it can be very fast to developp.

With hardware, it's a lot more complexe than this: you have several fields of engineering involved, including System engineering, Hw engineering, Layout engineering, even software engineering to do embedded systems programming, and on top of that a blockchain engineer. Also, to construct your product, you need to do a lot of sub contracting to other companies, because if you want to construct just 1 PCB, you need a whole industry of techniques.

Most people in the space are either clueless about tech investors and are just here for the pumps, or blockchain veterans that have spent so much time behind a computer, hacking and doing cryptography, that they have absolute no idea how a hardware is produced.


That being said, I know nothing about Walton anymore and can't judge, but can understand the delays and the problems.

I am very excited about any hardware solution",,,,,,
518,cant believe it 🚀,,,,,,
519,Oh boy,,,,,,
520,"Frankly I would be very worried if I was in WTC right now. Let's just set aside the 100+ red flags that this project has for a second and focus on this area in particular.

First, they lose Monitor Chan, their original COO (completely left the project). He exited fairly early after realizing how stained Walton's reputation is. He played a pretty significant role in the initial pump and dump in September 2017 during the slack days. 

Moving on, July 2019, Mo Bing, CEO, posts a ridiculous hype tweet promising the ""greatest news ever for WTC holders"". I repeat again, the ""greatest news ever"". During this time, the price pumped as expected. Sources point to Mo Bing dumping around the $3 peak. Naturally, what did the news end up being? A pump and dump scheme where the team would airdrop tokens if certain price targets are met by January 2020. 

Just think about that for a minute though. The CEO claims greatest news ever, and it's a price pump scheme. Just take a step back and really analyze that for a minute then get back to me. I don't blame him for stepping down and mitigating his risk. This is not the kind of man I would want as a CEO.",,,,,,
521,"This is one of the biggest shitcoin scams going. That people still think that this is a viable project shows what a state the crypto world is in.

This is one of maybe, maybe 10 out of thousands of cryptocurrencies that are combining hardware and software in a block chain project. Sorry but this takes time. If you have ever done programming in embedded systems and understand the enormous amount of work to get this off the ground, well, clearly you don't because you wouldn't be here whining about a project you have no interest in other than to cry bloody murder, clearly reflecting your ignorance on this topic.

I get it, everyone is mad about the price. Let's face it though -- how are ETH, Cardano, NEO and on and on doing price wise? They are all down %90 or so, hardly leaving Walton unique as far as price suppression. The dipshit clowns who have nothing better to do than attack legitimate projects just because they don't have it in their portfolio is grotesque. These people are such losers it's actually funny. I sure as hell laughed about it all -- by the way I have only *ever* put about $300 into this project so clearly I was reasonable about only investing what I can afford to lose.

The HOLO team have embarrassed themselves in various ways, including but not limited to not having a network, and selling people hardware and not delivering it.

Unfortunately this was probably their best move.

If they would have shipped the (now obsolete) warehouse PCs they sold people, it would be painfully obvious that they are just perpetuating a scam.

Now they have no choice. It has been too long. They have to make a move because people are running out of patience.

This shines a light on the most glaring issues: there is no working software, no Holofuel, and Holoports are about to be declared paperweights in videos and reviews on youtube and all over the internet.

So not delivering looks bad, but it gave them the opportunity to squeeze out this last big PnD before they are caught red handed selling useless legacy hardware with no real software platform to speak of.

At this point there is zero hope for this zombie project and the slow exit scam is underway.

I guess that's what happens when you steal your product strategy from a parody show about Silicon Valley.

To sum it up, if the ports ship it's going to zero. If the ports don't ship it's going to zero.

This latest effort is just a poorly paid shill group hired by the team and the few ramaining bagholders that know they are stuck with this garbage.

The team is exit scamming on you right now. There is no software and the hardware they sold and never delivered is outdated now.

Add to that stopping the export of miners from China for a few months and stock piling it. I don't think it would be that hard at all for China to obtain 51% of the hash rate if they wanted to.

I believe this is what David is alluding to, not China obtaining enough new fancy miners to out pace the rest of the ecosystem on the down low.

But if china wanted to kill bitcoin all they would need to do is to spend a few $$ sending BTC transactions back and forth forcing up the fees and delivery time on chain. It's possible that they can use their own farms to process and collect the huge fees so they are not actually losing that much right? over night the cost and speed of a btc transaction goes through the roof, they don't loose much on fees but anyone else that wants to transact has to pay through the roof or they cant transact.

Regradless, once a 51% eventually happens on BTC, the damage will be done. Who will want to store wealth in a exploitable system?

We have already seen many PoW DLTs such as BTC been 51% attacked: Bitcoin Cash (which once had 60 Billion+ in Mcap, currently Rank 5), and others such as Ethereum Classic, Verge, Bitcoin Gold, and more recently Vertcoin (which supposefully had anti-asic mechanisms).

The problem with this security model is that attackers don't need to have **skin in the game,** that is, being invested in the actual Token. They just need to invest in Hardware, which can be used to compute whatever.

That is why I see NANO's ORV as much more secure. The only way to attack the network is to have more than 51% of the ACTUAL TOKENS delegated to your node. For that to happen, you either need to buy it, or get most of the community to trust you.

Not only its way harder to pull it off, the cost involved is much bigger than to attack a PoW chain. If you achieve 51%, you'll be hurting yourself the most - as you are the biggest investor in the network (either in Capital or Time). Unlike a PoW DLT, where you can attack a chain and switch your mining power to any other chain, sucking as much profit of it as you go (minting + fees), then shorting it 100x and 51% attacking it to secure your trade.",,,,,,

If Ripple exploded today, the XRPL would continue on, yes its value would drop but nothing would stop the ledgers from closing and being processed.  You are equating a drop in price with the project stops working, which is false.

>Here's the deal; Bitcoin will fork off and live on

and who decides which algorithm to fork to, if you're leaving SHA 256 now every ASIC for it becomes useless, Who decides which is ""best"" going forward? The community has historically been awful at making these decisions, it would just lead to multiple forks.

> In both cases the chances of it happening in the first place is extremely low,

XRP is immune to 51% attacks.  It would take infinity dollars to even do one (because you cant use money to buy hashrate as there is none for XRP)  so 1 is mathematically impossible. the other is highly improbable. 

> the whole point of decentralization is lowering the amount as much as possible. 

BTC has become more centralized over time, not less. XRP is the opposite. started very centralized and has grown to become much more decentralized than many of the top assets today.

in a POW system, yes. In XRP's system, no it isnt impossible as I said above, a 51% attack on XRPL isnt possible. it is designed to be immune to it.

Your takeaway from this is that this is some fantastic scenario but your examples need actual work - addressing climate change needs support from billions of consumers, the alfa centauri is not comparable, the US has nukes, bitcoin's only defence against this is a fork that is again attackable AND will lose trust. The fork would be also cheaper to attack.  


Compare this to buying bitcoin by a government (Chinese for instance)  which can create money out of thin air, attacking the system would cost 1.4bln and you need small number of actors to pull it off.  


Your examples don't check out.  


That said, just buying a bunch over time and dumping the price would keep people off BTC and it would be way cheaper.

Wrong. Yes XRP is 51% ""proof"" but money can absolutely bribe their way into the ULR. Every project can buy control, you're ignorant to think otherwise. 

>If Ripple exploded today, the XRPL would continue on, yes its value would drop but nothing would stop the ledgers from closing and being processed.  You are equating a drop in price with the project stops working, which is false.

How did I say otherwise? The drop in price (and impling the NSA would short the market) is the whole point of his comment? Forking away *is* keeping Bitcoin working after such a thing happens. The whole fucking statement is ridiculous implying a 51% would break Bitcoin entirely. Markets would stop, roll backs will happen and the abusers would lose millions. How the hell do you think is logical that they can spend millions on hash *and* having that covered with ease? You really think that it is harder for the state to break XRP through Ripple, which wouldn't cost them a penny? 

>and who decides which algorithm to fork to, if you're leaving SHA 256 now every ASIC for it becomes useless, Who decides which is ""best"" going forward? The community has historically been awful at making these decisions, it would just lead to multiple forks. 

Ahhh I see now where you are going with this, the community can't decide so bitcoin dies? XD Let me remind you that XRPL forks/updates whatever are ""forced"" upon the community, don't update and your validator doesn't work anymore. You think a Ripple-less XRP can have a decisive nature in choosing their path? There are hundreds of algorithms, thinking this is the issue is downright foolish. 

>XRP is immune to 51% attacks.  It would take infinity dollars to even do one (because you cant use money to buy hashrate as there is none for XRP)  so 1 is mathematically impossible. the other is highly improbable. 

Again, my comment is about a attack by the state, one would cost 0, one would cost millions. You notice I'm making the same extreme as you? Also, stating a 51% is impossible is correct, but also semantics because that percentage is higher. You can in fact gain enough on the XRPL control albeit not 51%.

>BTC has become more centralized over time, not less. XRP is the opposite. started very centralized and has grown to become much more decentralized than many of the top assets today.

False, pools grew more decentralized over time. You can check yourself using the Herfindahl-Hirchman Index (HHI) which is used for checking market concentration. The days where pools actually controlled near 50% often were in 2014. XRP is not much of a celebration, it took YEARS to even be considered decentralized, we need lots of more years to check whether that trend continues. Considering many of the validators are Ripple partners as well it's hard to say whether that means no Ripple control.

1015,">And this is way before Satoshi's whitepaper.

This has little, if anything, to do with Satoshi's whitepaper. Satoshi did **not** invent distributed computing or parallel processing; he invented the blockchain. The patent seems to be about distributed computing in general: i.e., breaking up a problem into smaller pieces across different machines in a cluster, and then reassembling the outputs into a final solution (in a ""split-apply-combine strategy""). Indeed, this has little to do with blockchain or, say, what nodes in Bitcoin or Ethereum do.

In Bitcoin or Ethereum, individual nodes do *not* each receive a little piece of a problem in order to solve one larger computation. Rather, they all perform the same computation redundantly. For example, every Ethereum node will execute the same smart contract code; the smart contract code is not broken down into smaller pieces across nodes, and the overall task is *not* split up among the nodes/computers to be processed.

The distributedness of blockchain is not what makes it interesting. Public key cryptography is not what makes blockchain interesting (we've had such cryptography for a long time), and Satoshi did not invent it. Hash functions and proof-of-work are not what make blockchain interesting (we've had them for awhile, too), and Satoshi did not invent them either.

What makes blockchain interesting is its solution to the consensus problem. The solution to this problem *allows a distributed system—and in the case of blockchain, a distributed database—to become a* **decentralized** *system*. All decentralized systems are distributed, but not all distributed systems are decentralized.

The first major benefit of a full on ban would be finally reaching consensus to upgrade bitcoin with privacy features. Bitcoin would get Mimble Wimble or something similar faster than Charlie Lee can make another false Litecoin promise. Bitcoin would go back to being the private store of value that it was originally intended as. The only reasons we can't agree on making BTC private is because too many would be concerned about scaring away institutional money or losing government indifference. Well, there's no institutional money or indifference if BTC is banned. Side note: Let's not forget that chains like Monero will be right at home under these circumstances. Future decenteralized exchanges will be easier and better to operate. This will add to the appeal of private networks.

Not only would BTC privacy upgrades be highly likely and fast paced, but sweeping network scalability upgrades would be the logical next step. All miners would be at a massive net loss and network security would be at risk. BTC would likely move to a staking model and the old chain would only be run as a historical network. Public social consensus will pave the road necessary to realize the new BTC network as the ""real"" Bitcoin. Snap shots, air drops and coordinators would make the transition easy and full of options.

A staked, private, code-able and properly scaled BTC network would open the doors for private transactions, micro transactions, private smart contracts and even features like off chain peer-2-peer in person transacting. There would be absolutely no way to fight this and this would be the worst outcome for any government looking to stop digital world monetary systems run by the public.

Honestly, this is the reason I don't think there will ever be a full on ban, but governments don't always think long term. Governments are better off just leaving things be. The community is already too nervous to really upgrade Bitcoin and a large percent just spend their energy fighting over which coin is better.

Because of the Byzantine General Problem, you cannot ""break up your problem in small pieces and have the nodes each compute a small piece of the problem"". Most, if not all blockchains do the exact opposite: every Bitcoin node calculates each and every transaction. Every Ethereum node runs *all* the smart contract code for a transaction.

With Ethereum, your cryptokitty smart contract is ran on thousands of computers in parallel. Each one coming to the same outcome. 

Sharding in ETH will distribute the computing a little. But the nature of permissionless blockchains requires a majority of nodes to run a piece of code on each and every computer over again.

Except that is wrong and incorrect.

&#x200B;

When you double spend you are NOT creating new money, you are changing the address you sent it to.

Example.

I send 1BTC to you...the block chain says I sent 1 BTC to you...

You have been paid 1BTC according to the block chain...you send me my product...

I the attacker, do a 51% attack and instead of sending you the 1 BTC, I send it to myself on my secret chain I have been mining without telling the network.

I now release my 51% attacked chain which is longer than the one I sent you money on.

Everyone on the network agrees, this longer chain is the valid one, not the one I sent you money with.

The money I sent you on the other chain never happened, everyone agrees this new chain is the real one.

How was money printed or created in this example?

NO MONEY WAS CREATED!

Only the destination of the BTC I sent to you was changed back to me, so it was sent to me instead.

&#x200B;

Even with double spend attacks, there will only ever be 21 million BTC. None are minted or created during a 51% attack.

1155,The fork would require changing hash algorithm away from sha256 so the attackers ASICs couldn't be used. Then mining would be all GPUs again assuming they go with something new. If the attacker is ready for that with GPUs then bitcoin would be destroyed as there's no where left to go and any fork can be ruined by the attacker. So PoW chains can be destroyed absolutely with a 51% attack. With PoS the attackers funds can be slashed as soon as they do anything wrong and the problem is solved.,,,,,,

Actually it is not even the senders that are harmed, but the receivers, so only recipients must take care.

1178,Having 51% of the hash power means you will find a new block approximately 51% of the time. Which means in order to re-write 6 blocks you'd have to re-do the proof of work for 6 blocks by the time the other 49% of the network found one block.

PoW attackers can remove valid transactions from the ledger, insert their own valid transactions into the ledger, and prevent transaction confirmation.

The process of social coordination could maybe be made very efficient if there were a set of widely trusted community leaders all working together to make it happen, but if the government started targeting these people as well and everyone had to coordinate while staying anonymous and underground, it would be difficult.",,,,,,
1191,"No, that isn't how the blockchain works.

If you have >50% of the hashing power, you can rewrite as far back as you want - given you have been running it for long enough.  

The reality of a 51% is that you start mining at block B, and keep the 51% chain private.  You send the coins in block B+1.  Wait for a confirmation - block B+7.  Then, you release your chain as soon as it is one block longer than the main chain.

Ex: you release 8 blocks (B+8), and since your chain is now longer than the longest alternate chain (B+7), the entire network switches to your chain - without the sent coins.

That is the strength of a 51% attack.  You can literally undo every transaction since you started the attack.

It only gets worse if you have >51% of the hashing power.  You could start reversing time, and reversing transactions that started before you even started the attack.",,,,,,

This is so very unlikely to happen its almost impossible.

You would have to start hashing from block 1 and mine more blocks than have been mined since the start, while at the same time outpacing the new blocks being added on at the end.

Currently even with all the hash power of the network, it would still take months if not years to make a chain that long....and by that time the current real chain will have months if not years more blocks on them.

You would never be able to rewrite the entire chain, its not possible.",,,,,,

1226,"Cash is almost equally at risk in the event of an exchange hack. If they get hacked, they are either insolvent or they stay afloat. If they are insolvent, administrators are appointed and all value (crypto, cash, buildings, assets, etc) gets sold and returned to creditors (in order of priority, minus fees) - you as a user will likely see nothing. If they stay afloat they will either absorb the losses as a company (unlikely unless they’re big) or socialise the losses and give every user a haircut.",,,,,,
1227,"Yes it can and it has been reported even on reputable larger exchanges. If a hacker gains access to your account, they can then use your fiat to buy Bitcoin for example. Then they can withdraw the Bitcoin to a public address that they control with their private key. Your fiat would be gone and the exchange will blame you for poor account security. To guard against this you should obviously have 2FA setup on your account. But you should also have a ""whitelist"" for both your IP address and your withdrawl public addresses. That way you (or the hacker) can only withdraw to a public address that you control, not them, and as such no harm would be done. Typically adding a new whitelist public address takes 48-72 hours to occur and requires email verification from the email address that you control. IP whitelisting is also good, meaning only someone with your IP address can withdraw. Each exchange is a little different in how they implement whitelisting, so read the details on the exchange carefully. Stay safe !",,,,,,

Exchanges are not banks, one should not treat them like banks.",,,,,,
1235,"Yes, but create a white list for withdrawing addresses and different 2FA for login, trades and funding (3 different google authenticator codes).
Also lock the security settings with a password or a different method so it cannot be modified. You can even setup a yubikey if you are extremley paranoid.",,,,,,

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States"".  The order was made under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act the previous month.

The limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93–373 which went into effect December 31, 1974.

It is sad that after so long time since then, due to the lack of people's research on the topic or even manipulation from the news, this belief prevailed.",,,,,,

1306,"The murder for hire charges against Ulbricht were dropped after making headlines in the news. The judge cited this charge in his sentencing despite his innocence of that charge and at least two of the undercover agents involved were later convicted of more heinous crimes, in my opinion. I'm not sure if murder for hire was traded on the original silk road, but the creators of similar sites following the fall of silk road were offered plea deals with no jail time. Ross was meant to be an example and he was sentenced on false pre-tenses. I say let the man go free.",,,,,,

1308,I think the issue was precisely what you mentioned. He knew what was going on with respects to his website and did nothing about it. Facebook has builtin algorithms to monitor for unscrupulous activities as well as a reporting mechanism for users to report questionable activities. Ross's imprisonment was a LOUD message that regulators and legal authorities wanted to send to the crypto world. Just like the Ethereum developer who supposedly went to educate N.

1312,"He actually wasn’t personally trafficking narcotics, he held dominion over a marketplace that allowed for trafficking of narcotics and benefitted monetarily from it",,,,,,
1313,He was not personally trafficking narcotics.  He simply created and ran a truly free and open marketplace. Something like 80% of sales on the site were simply for marijuana which is now legal for the rich and powerful to sell in about half the country.,,,,,,
1314,"what the hell do you think cryptocurrency is for? are you lost? he was a peaceful individual offering a platform for consenting adults to buy stuff that don't harm any third person, and neither you nor the state should have any fucking regard to this",,,,,,
1315,"I think you don't have the full facts with regards to murder for hire charges. There is absolutely no evidence that the murders occurred - the courts did not (and could not) tie any known murders to Ross's hiring of hitmen. But when you observe the chat records, Ross fully paid for the killing of 5 individuals, and the hitman actually convinced him that he did, in fact, commit the murders (he sent photo evidence to convince Ross). So from Ross's point of view, those were successful hits that he paid for.

Now I'm blurry about the following, but the real identity of the hitman Ross hired, and the identity of the victims are not known as far as I'm aware. They are users from Silk Road and it all started because some vendor threatened to release the names and addresses of their clients thus compromising the site's anonymity - because they had a dispute with another user / vendor (complaining that they weren't paid what they were owed). From there it escalated. Ross thought he managed to get this vendor killed, then seeing how easy it was, moved on to other targets.

The first target was the vendor that threatened to release the info, and the second target was someone who works with the first target, the other 3 were the associates of the second target. The hitman Ross hired was actually (supposedly) the supplier of the first target who saw him as a liability. In reality, they all might be the same person or a couple of friends scamming Ross of course. In any case, Ross fully believed that he was able to get those people killed, and took notes of when he paid for those hits, and their results. Also the government was able to link the payments from Ross's wallets to the hitman on his computer that was seized.

Start from Page 19 here if you want to see how things transpired: [https://www.pbwt.com/content/uploads/2017/05/15-1815\_opn.pdf](https://www.pbwt.com/content/uploads/2017/05/15-1815_opn.pdf)",,,,,,

1317,"Pedophilia groups, revenge porn groups, extremist groups... the list goes on.",,,,,,
1318,"Ross didn't enable a single pedo, though. CP was forbidden on SR.",,,,,,
1319,That parole part is certainly bullshit. Even Manson gets parole hearings. With no parole possible you can't even pretend that federal prison is about rehabilitation in all cases.,,,,,,
1320,"Drug sentencing in the States is very harsh. Although I guess its better than if he was caught in the far east, probably have been executed.

1321,He did actually grow and  sell mushrooms for a time IIRC I think when will road was just starting.,,,,,,
1322,my mom buys pounds of weed off FB,,,,,,
1323,He was trying to recruit new sellers to the site and tried to have multiple men killed during the process. His message logs from the site are the source of that info.,,,,,,
1324,"he started it by selling his own mushrooms

but regardless, he is a peaceful person, nothing else matters",,,,,,
1325,He definitely sold drugs when SR was starting up so that there would be something on it.,,,,,,
1326,"I appreciate the link and I admit the evidence presented against him looks damning on the surface. However, the vast majority of the evidence against him is digital which could have been fabricated. Worst case scenario he paid over a $500k for some gruesome pics regardless of his intention. I find it highly suspicious the two corrupt officers were involved in at least the one attempted murder case. I don't think we can be sure his DPR account wasn't compromised prior to his arrest. I would even argue the government had motive to frame him on these charges considering sales on the silk road were cutting into CIA cocaine trafficking profits, not to mention it would strengthen their case for the criminal enterprise charge. This was one of his defenses as noted on pgs 22-23.

I'd also urge you to consider the argument his defense makes on pgs 30-31 stating that the site reduced violence associated with the drug trade. This makes perfect sense to me- no hand to hand purchases mean less potential for conflict and no territory to protect. In any classic drug trafficking organization on this scale, undeniably a lot more people would have died- either through direct physical violence or indirectly causing overdoses by cutting the product. The court implied this was a delusional argument and even used it to justify a longer sentence (pg 121).

I bought the media narrative on the murder for hire for many years until I heard his mom talk about the case. I'm not saying she has all the facts or is fully aware of what her son was doing during that period, but I'd recommend hearing her out.",,,,,,

He started comparing him with pedos first. Its supposed to be an example, but you'd have to ask that dude.",,,,,,
1329,If I remember correctly the “tried to have people killed” was hearsay and never actually admitted to court as evidence,,,,,,
1330,y'all were right about the mushroom thing- that was news to me. Thanks for the correction.,,,,,,
1331,I stand corrected- looks like he did grow/sell some mushrooms on the site at first,,,,,,
1332,"Facebook is currently embroiled in a controversy because the platform wants to allow (ie, facilitate) political ads that wilfully spread lies and propaganda. 

Some of these ad campaigns encourage hate speech, racism and violence. 

I wouldn't say the two are so far apart, when you look at it from a moral perspective. Zuckerburg is making just as much money off other's wrongdoing and Ulbricht did.",,,,,,
1333,"They try to fight some of the above mentioned groups, others they ignore or just half heartedly ban.",,,,,,
1334,"It wasn't admitted as evidence so you're right but it is very clearly what the person using his account on silk road was asking for. His argument was it could be anyone, which is true. My personal opinion is he was the only one in control of that account.",,,,,,

1354,Bakkt futures aren't fully backed by Bitcoin nor are the reserves verified. Plus I don't think it's clear whether traders can take delivery in Bitcoin. Bakkt is probably bad for crypto.

A futures market helps to even that out as it does manage expectations. However, I do agree with you, and that it's a complicated marriage of institutional money being involved. However, unfortunately, you can't shove that cat back into the bag. A senator who is pretty well versed in BTC and it's futures is definitely not a bad thing though for adoption. Some of the folks in the House and Senate didn't even know what Facebook was two years ago, so this definitely raises the bar on folks who ""get it"".",,,,,,

1461,"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania (Dutch: tulpenmanie) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis. Historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

In it's simplest form, account holders would be able to have as easy payment processing as they already have but with the added benefit of receiving the overnight rate for interest on holdings. These are the types of economic arguments you'll start to hear from central bankers. We'll hear a lot less about the privacy component, or lack there of,  which is a big part of the push we'll see for e-coins (not traditional cryptocurrency).

The cost of maintaining the accounts and performing transactions can be downloaded to the network however constructed, ultimately lowering the transaction costs of this type of direct central bank account that e-coins could enable.

Slapping a blockchain on it could mean shit, if central bank issued wallets have any interoperability with cryptocurrency wallets or crypto exchanges, what I see as the more likely option, but still far from a certainty.

1497,"""Being used"" is a little bit far fetched. I would count USD to MXN and PHP and even those are still in ramping up phase. The rest is still early testing. Interesting and promising none the less.

1508,Alright thanks,,,,,,
1509,"Official looking (BTC) scam websites can be easily bought off the dark net.
I've seen fake online stores, fake crypto exchanges, fake casino websites, you name it.
They're up for sale for 250-1000 USD.

Especially the crypto related websites are easy to set up. You would only have to change some wallet addresses that only the scammer has access to.

Then buy a domain, upload your files, let a bot contact as many people on Reddit, Telegram, etc... to lure them into believing they have won BTC and there you go...
There's no doubt in my mind people are still falling for it on a daily basis.

I could set up the whole thing in under an hour if I wanted to.

Don't be fooled by ""how really professional a website looks""!",,,,,,

1533,"Honestly, just when you thought people in this space are finally starting to savvy up to all the bullshit scammers out there, they all pile into HEX..   


It's a fucking ETH grab masquerading as a free bitcoin airdrop. Give everyone a bunch of worthless tokens in the hopes that a handful will actually pay ETH to get more. And who gets the ETH at the end of it? You guessed it, fucking Richard Heart.

1546,^^   *this*   -- ...and he certainly fixed that problem for himself this week.,,,,,,
1547,"So the deposit address is then transferred to an internal address. The total as of writing this is 22991 ETH.

1548,"It is in principle there is no doubt about that.

However, sending eth to a private wallet and receiving an arbitrary amount of tokens which will arbitrarily go up in number over an arbitrary amount of time sounds a bit 'hollow' right. It's not like compound or something like that where there is actual peer to peer lending, this is sort of just, creating value out of thin air and then hoping some liquidity forms underneath it.",,,,,,
1549,That would be wise,,,,,,
1550,Pretty easy to justify it tbh. Dogecoin is a meme coin that is worth a quarter of a billion dollars. Utility value doesn't exist apparently.,,,,,,
1551,And they had The Carlos Matos.,,,,,,
1552,And how many does HEX have?,,,,,,
1553,"Nah, I don't think he's said publicly where exactly he lives, but somewhere in Europe.",,,,,,
1554,Dump your 10% lol,,,,,,
1555,"Totally agree, thats why i am also staying away from minting HEX via AA for now. I want to see it getting used and building liquidity.
Just throwing out that in theory this is a cool defi project, which elevates the whole ecosystem in contrast of other guys screaming scam with no real arguments.
The minting contract is the same as EOS, so by that metric all ico projects are scams (which is debatable)",,,,,,
1556,"Dogecoin is obviously dogshit, but at least it has _some_ liquidity  

If you buy dogecoin you're likely very stupid. If you buy HEX you're a cunthair above fully braindead.",,,,,,
1557,"Yeah I think that is a good approach to it, it's not to say that it won't have value just on pure network and social media attention alone, which it does have. I assume it's a matter of time before it gets properly supported on some DEX.

My bigger issue with it was the way they keep insisting it's just 'donations' and 'self minting' etc so it can't possibly be a security and that it's really revolutionary and all that overly defensive mentality in the social media channels!

At the end of the day it is simply an ICO for an ERC20 with an inflationary staking model, which as you say has been done before and isn't anything new, but of course doesn't stop it gaining traction.",,,,,,
1558,Liquidity is a temporarily problem? HEX has three upcoming exchange listings and one it just opened (Bidesk). I don't think liquidity is a long-term problem. What do you hold btw? Chinese Unsafe Centralization Dump-based Pollutionary Coin?,,,,,,
1559,"Fucking shill lol 

I hope HEX brings you happiness and vast riches you fucking dolt",,,,,,
1560,"Lol people getting salty as fuck over this. Tell me what's the difference between hex and almost any other token in this space? 99% of crypto projects with ""serious, world changing"" goals don't even need a fucking token attached to them in the first place. Their market value comes solely from their marketing efforts. No one uses this shit in the real world.

 Blockchain is a great technology. Most crypto is absolutely worthless though. At least he's telling you the main purpose of HEX is to try and play the speculative game. Which is why everyone is here for anyway if they're being honest with themselves. Free claim and see where the chips fall. Who cares? If you don't want to spend anything then don't send anything to AA.",,,,,,

1630,"The current internet infrastructure is very robust and most of it is totally fine a neutral. 

There are three Tiers of internet Infrastructure.

Tier 1 internet infrastructure is the actually cables that go between continents under the sea and such transfering internet trafic. 

Tier 2 are like the hubs in each continent that futher distribute cables and stuff to various parts of the country/continent. Tier 2 buys internet transit from Tier 1, and then sells that to Tier 3.

Tier 3 internet providers are the ones we actually buy our internet from. These are the anoying ones, as they are the ones who can throttle your speed and potentially censor. Tier 2 and Tier 1 don't really care. They just want to sell their internet transit/trafic. 

There is definitly no need to replace Tier 1. Tier 1 is great infrastructure and is needed to transfer between continents fast. Tier 2 is also pretty fine, as they just relay it to Tier 2. Tier 3 is also ok as long as they cannot throttle specific sites/apps, peer in on users private data, and cannot censor. 

The beauty of Elastos carrier is you do not need to replace this infrastructure. The infrastructure is really good. We can easily get 100 Mbp/s which is really fast. What needs to be modified is the protocol. Elastos Carrier routes traffic in a different way. As of now, when internet trafic is routed, it all needs to be passed through a central server at some point. For instance when you go to a webiste, traffic first goes to a big server/database that translates the URL into an IP address. If the company owning this server decides to blacklist a URL, people can't use it. This also makes internet trafic routing predictable, and also it means that if you shut down the server, or if the censor cuts off trafic to certain IP/DNS addresses, you can effectivley censor certain website or apps. With Elastos, internet traffic is relayed peer to peer. This means traffic does not need to go to a central server first, so there is no way to censor or shut down. If there is not a direct route between peers, then traffic will hop between others peers on the network(relays), until it gets to the end users. ISP peering in on private user data is solved by encrypting all network trafic. This also means relays cannot look in on the data. Only the person with the correct public key private key pair can see.

This is a good solution. We don't really need to replace all the physics infrastructure, and competing against ISP is not a good idea. They are hugely powerful, and will use lobbying to try and destory anything that tries to destroy them. With Elastos, they are still getting paid so they don't care. Elastos just protects users from ISPs, whil still using their very robust infrastructure.",,,,,,

So long as there is a way to encrypt your communication there will be a way to run decentralized applications on top of the current infrastructure.

With the death of Net Neutrality though this whole argument does come into question... As they now could have it be a pay to use service or change the foundation of the infrastructure altogether.

Once this happens the internet will be owned by a small few, the poor will have to pay for the services they never had to before and around that time the world will probably be melting and roasting and a war will break out and ppl hopefully will riot.

""The consumer is to blame for billionaires"" - so u don't think someone like Bezos or Zucc purposefully create a system where you are at a severe disadvantage to not use it, since most companies have Facebook pages, most businesses purchase from Amazon. Most ppl need to work. Most ppl do this by working at businesses that have FB pages and buy Amazon.

Sorry for not wanting to sell oranges by the freeway? But to say it's the CONSUMERS fault for being stuck in a faulty, curupt system that takes advantage of them as much as possible is about as silly as saying I have purchasing power to make a difference and ""vote"" with my $ when I barely have enough money for rent or food and work 40+ hrs. a week at a minimum wage job.

How u can blame the every day Joe for the failure of capitalism only can make sense if you are saying that because we are in the capitalist society that is failing we also are at fault. Even with that faulty logic there are many arguments that poor/most people CAN'T move vertically, it's configured that way. 

Capitalism - rich get richer poor get poorer. That's not the poor ppls fault. 

Also your wrong about decentralized internet with no central authority. If ppl want to ""be with their chosen warlord"" then they can, but that doesn't change the fact that since it's decentralized they have just as much ""power"" or incentive or just plain ability to move to anywhere else; that is the beauty of decentralization.

Tor is a great example of the power in decentralization. Have the ability to make where and what you want to go and create with no central authority to subscribe to. Multiple exit nodes, at least 3 in the onion routing hops, all encrypted so no one can figure out and manipulate.

Sure, we can say that the cables are owned by companies. And the electricity is owned by companies. And and and...But let's start from the bottom and work our way back up. The idea that you can't modify your own iPhone without voiding the warranty because you don't ""own"" your phone is absolutely bullshit. So let's start from that foundation. First, get your own server. Then, build your own software to connect your servers. Now, you have a meshnet. Build businesses, build support, grow capital, and then we can talk about creating decentralized Internet companies if you like...But one step at a time. Holochain is laying down some major roadwork towards a decentralized Internet. There's no need to throw shade.

For those that still didn't click the link, just imagine if every piece of an app had API properties. So you want to build a new app? Cool. Do you want a chat feature? Because there's already a chat app that you can bridge to and utilize seamlessly within your own app (and not have it connected to the other IF you wish, OR have it directly connected, that choice is yours).

So, you love cat photos that you see on Facebook and Twitter, but hate Facebook and Twitter? Well, assuming that FB and Twitter were being run via holochain, you can customize your experience to have a single page/app that just scrapes all the cat photos from both of these sites because all of a sudden, the information that's within the apps is no longer explicitly owned by the apps. These are just some of the elements being constructed within holochain.

If you give a shit about being a part of one of the paths towards a better decentralized Internet, it's worth exploring. I've personally known the founders since 2013. I've been to their houses. They are the sweetest and most genuine people you've ever met and they are as humble and noble as they come. I shit you not.

Each one could be considered worthless but they are collectively all that compose the billion dollars. Likewise where would Bezos or Zucchiniberg be without each of the consumers who decide to use their products? 

I agree about the onion project but ultimately even that is subject to a 51% attack on its anonymity through control of the majority of its exit nodes. Correlation attacks and all that.

My original point is. People always have a choice whether to buy or build regardless of the circumstances or consequences. Average Joe needing to use amazon and Facebook sounds like a first world problem to me.

They also have bridges to avoid exit node detection and pluggable transports to obfuscate the connection to not look like Tor traffic.

It's a wonderful example of how the internet was made. It was made by DARPA for war, it's supposed to always find the shortest and fastest routable path first, be modular and stack protocols. Tor is like a top stacked protocol in a sense.....

With the above government controlled digital currencies, we have neither, which centralises knowledge, power and surveillance capabilities.

However, as a store of value, when we talk about large amounts of wealth, I think that the variables there differ. There is too much at stake, and the calculus is different.

6,"A cryptocurrency wallet is the equivalent of a bank account. It allows a trader to receive bitcoins and other coins, store them, and then send them to other traders. A crypto-trader must think of a wallet as an interface to the Bitcoin network, similar to how online banking account is an interface to the regular monetary system. Wallets contain private keys; secret codes that enable traders to spend some coins. In reality, it’s not coins that need to be stored and secured, but the private keys that gives access to them. In short, crypto or Bitcoin wallet is simply an app, website, or device that manages private keys for a trader.

Mycelium is an open-source mobile wallet that is designed for those that wish to trade strictly in Bitcoin. The most noticeable characteristic is the user interface. Users are greeted by a clean, intuitive design with multiple setting controls, from display language and local fiat currency to the denomination of BTC the user will be dealing in. The smooth and straightforward design appeals to both novice users and more advanced traders. Mobile wallets run on an app on phone and are useful because they can be used anywhere including retail stores. Mobile wallets are usually much smaller and simpler than desktop wallets because of the limited space available on mobile.

While the Ledger Nano S is a very popular hardware wallet. The emphasis on security, as well as promoting an easy to use device, has made the Nano S an obvious choice for many crypto enthusiasts with large amounts of assets. The Nano S supports major coins like BTC, ETH, and XRP as well as hundreds of altcoins. Hardware wallets can be fit with several web interfaces that can support different currencies; it just depends on which one a trader decides to use. Users simply plug in their device to any internet-enabled computer or device, enter a pin, send currency and confirm. 

As seen in this few examples of crypto wallets, there is a wallet out there for every type of investor: from day traders on the move, holding dozens of different coins that need constant access to their funds, to the holder that rarely touches their assets. The most important step in finding a crypto wallet is examining the needs, expectations and determining which wallet best suits a trader. Finding the right wallet is the first and perhaps most important step, in exploring the distinct and profitable world of cryptocurrencies.",,,,,,

Founded in 2017, GoChain started with an idea to fix the blockchain scaling problem while bringing an enterprise team and business philosophy to the space. We hit our goal by providing a public network that handles 100x the volume of Ethereum while remaining 100% Ethereum compatible.

We are partnered with AWS, IBM, and Microsoft and serve clients ranging from innovative, high impact startups to Fortune 200 companies like Dish Network.

4,And I KNOW those “analysts” don’t have a clue what it’s going to do.,,,,,,
5,"Reason 1's ""nothing-at-stake"" problem has had solutions available for a long time now, [see for example Ethereum's strategy](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ#what-is-the-nothing-at-stake-problem-and-how-can-it-be-fixed). A validator that publishes a block on forked chain A can be punished for it on forked chain B, so they only get to pick one of the two chains to support even if their stake split when the fork happened.

I'm not sure what Reason 2 is about. Stakers actually do risk their money and actually do have to do work to validate blocks, PoS is not a passive ""money just for having money"" scheme. And if an Ether owner is willing to give his money to the custody of a bank that will then stake it and earn more money off of it, why wouldn't they just give it to the custody of a staking pool and get the earned money for themselves?

Reason 3 appears to depend on ""nothing-at-stake"" to be valid.

Reason 4 is also kind of baffling. It argues that you can only know who is staking coins by referencing information that's on the blockchain itself, I think? Well, that's what blockchains are *for*, keeping track of who owns what. A 51% attacker still can't inject completely arbitrary transactions into the blockchain's state, they won't be properly signed and it'll be obviously invalid. Then they get slashed and they're not a 51% attacker any more.

Reason 5 is the ""rich get richer"" argument, which actually is more of a problem for PoW than PoS because PoW has inherent economies of scale (a large PoW mining operation is more efficient and therefore earns more profit per hash). PoS stakers all get rewards exactly proportionate to the size of their stake, so the ""poor"" get rich exactly in proportion to the ""rich"" getting rich. It changes nothing, relatively speaking. Reason 5's other argument is that if a large portion of the circulating Ether gets locked up as stake then nobody will be able to buy enough to become significant stakers later on, but there are solutions to this that can be built into PoS as well. Ethereum's plan is to make the total staking rewards vary depending on how much of the total Ether supply is locked up in stakes, aiming to keep the total stake amount around 10% of the total Ether supply if I recall correctly.

In summary, this appears to be arguing against a very primitive and naive version of Proof of Stake. The field has developed much more sophisticated implications that solve these problems, though.",,,,,,

Based on the supply & demand curve, what is the value of an intermediate asset that's designed to be entered & exited rapidly with ease?

ie. If I buy 1 million XRP in EUD, and simultaneously sell 1 million XRP in USD, what does that do to the overall price of XRP?

Answer: If there is insufficient (liquidity) XRP to support the transaction then it affects the price. However, it also affects the usability of XRP for its intended purpose. If there is sufficient liquidity, it has exactly zero affect on the supply/demand price curve.

Compare this with Bitcoin or Monero which is used as a *store of value*. where the more people who store their value in the coin causes the demand to increase in relation to supply, the less people store their value in the coin, the lower the coin price.

The asset value of any token that is not designed to be a store of value, is near zero. Any price above that is being supported by speculation, and will eventually return to its intrinsic value.

**Nixon shock**

The Nixon shock was a series of economic measures undertaken by United States President Richard Nixon in 1971, in response to increasing inflation, the most significant of which were wage and price freezes, surcharges on imports, and the unilateral cancellation of the direct international convertibility of the United States dollar to gold.While Nixon's actions did not formally abolish the existing Bretton Woods system of international financial exchange, the suspension of one of its key components effectively rendered the Bretton Woods system inoperative. While Nixon publicly stated his intention to resume direct convertibility of the dollar after reforms to the Bretton Woods system had been implemented, all attempts at reform proved unsuccessful. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system was replaced de facto by the current regime based on freely floating fiat currencies.

41,"Yup. At this point, I just take all news with a grain of salt. 90% of the time it’s just over exaggerated drama. For example, a headline I saw the other day was ‘iPhone 11 still tracking users despite switching off location services’. The actual problem was that some apps simply didn’t have a location slider to turn off and used location services by default. Granted this is a different problem, but not the one the title would have you believe.",,,,,,
42,"Yes and no, in the context of what you've provided.

If you're just holding a shit load of cash, yes inflation leaves you at a loss because the value of what you have has been diluted.

Your context requires participation and leveraging the equalization of the extra money across an economy.

I'm not arguing the rich don't do that, but they have to if they want to remain rich, and there's a limit to it. The same method can also be used to mutiny an entire ruling class if done in excess.",,,,,,

They just wanted more money to fund their projects. And yes, fund the XRP ecosystem. Fair enough. But we all knew what they were doing. They just pushed it too far, and that has an effect on sentiment that's hard to recover in a market such as this currently.

127,"It sitting in escrow is just showing how much is going to be the total circulating supply eventually, so who cares? We know what the total supply of BTC and ETH will be, it just hasn’t been mined yet, there’s no difference there. Ripple releases one billion per month, and that has been known for years. Them releasing them each month is almost identical to BTC or ETH being mined every month. It’s increasing the supply of it. In fact, XRP over the past quarter has had a smaller supply increase % than ETH has.

Also ripple owning the majority of it means they are genuinely invested and interested in the success of XRP more so than anyone else. When XRP goes down, they lose more money than anyone else.. you could also say the same about the 2-3 BTC whales in China that control most of the mining and own most of the supply. So what is the difference there, except that the Chinese whales are more likely to dump randomly?

You asked Why would a big bank buy off of an exchange when they can buy directly from Ripple? Simple, if ripple directs them to the exchange. Look at what they just did this month, they released 1B from escrow then immediately locked it all back up in escrow. That could mean they are refusing to sell at this price, or they are directing buyers to the exchanges, or they are listening to the community and cutting back on sales.

Do you think it's cause they wanted to pretend there's less supply out there, or do you think it's cause their projections show they had no potential buyers? I'll make it easy and just answer.  They're a business.  They're there to make money.  They 100% did it because they currently have no buyers, not as some good faith show to their beloved community.

2) why would ripple do that? As I said they are obviously very interested in the success of Xrp.

3) they CANNOT dump all the xrp in escrow in one click. That’s absolute bullshit. It’s cryptographically locked up, they can only access it as per the contract, 1B per month. They can only dump what the individuals hold, so whatever Brad owns personally he can dump if he chooses, etc. the escrow will never be an issue. It’s just disbursing the supply out at nearly the same rate that BTCs supply is disbursed by mining",,,,,,
137,"I’m the one doing the mental gymnastics? I just said in my original post that people will hate on ripple if they dump, or hate if they don’t dump, which is exactly what you are doing. You really think that ripple who’s usage has only been getting higher and higher, has had their first month with no buyers? They have shown that they listen to the community. They said in their last quarter report that they are cutting back on the sales, of which is what they have been doing. 

You keep forgetting one important thing: ripple cares about the success of XRP, and the XRP holders are a BIG factor in the success of XRP. If we all fuck off, then the price tanks, and that’s harder for ripple to explain to current clients who bought at a higher price, and harder to explain to future clients who see the investments fall. 

Everything I said is valid, you don’t seem to have any valid rebuttals to it. The whales potential to dump BTC is just as brutal as ripples potential to dump XRP, except one is more likely than the other, because one is interested in the success of their product and one is held accountable for it. The anonymous whales can fuck off and never need to say a word or answer to anything. You seemed to focus in on the “it will spread out from China”, that’s not the point. The point is that like 2-3 PEOPLE HAVE THE MAJORITY OF THE SUPPLY. What will you say when ripples ownership of XRP is under 50%, then they don’t own the majority of the supply anymore, then you will just find something else to talk shit about. You talking shit about them deciding not to sell is proof of just that. You will hate on them no matter what they do.

Also, there seems to be a misconception about the xrp in escrow. they CANNOT dump all the xrp in escrow. That’s absolute bullshit. It’s cryptographically locked up, they can only access it as per the contract, 1B per month,, and every month we see what they do with it, if it is sold or if it is moved back to escrow. They can only dump what the individuals hold, so whatever Brad owns personally he can dump if he chooses, etc. the escrow will never be an issue. Escrow is just disbursing the supply out at nearly the same rate that BTCs supply is disbursed by mining.",,,,,,
138,"Traction for the concept ? Sure. To address the latter part of your response, that is my exact point.. not right now, but what’s that worth, we are in pre model T era",,,,,,
139,"Yes I understand ripple cares about ripple's success.  XRP individual holders are not a big factor to the success you're a stopgap.  If you were a factor they would build all their marketing towards you.  They're marketing and selling to banks, and it's naive to think otherwise.  I get it though, you're emotional about this (as is most of the ripple cult), and that's why you're passionate that everything you said is valid and mine isn't.  Ripple is your pick so you want it to succeed and the value to go to $10 each or something insane to believe will ever happen.

 >They said in their last quarter report that they are cutting back on the sales, of which is what they have been doing.

Seriously!?!? Think about what you said.  If they're concerned about Ripple's success then they should be selling all the time to anyone that will buy it.  Why would you invest in a company not doing that? Would you invest in McDonalds if they went to their shareholders and said ""Hey guys we're selling too many burgers so we're going to pull them off the menu for a month.""?  Does that sound more likely, or is it they currently don't have any prospects and aren't getting the meetings they once were during the boom?  There's other things at play than them just not selling any for a month to help you individual holders.  Again, don't be that naive.

No shit they can't dump all their xrp in escrow all at once.  No one has that misconception.  That's such a weird trick they pulled on ripple fans.  They pretend to have less supply cause they can only access 1BN a month?!  What's the point?  Other than I guess it works on some people.  There's currently more supply than there is demand or they wouldn't be locking the 1BN back up hoping for brighter days later.  Anyway it's pointless to argue with someone that's emotional about it so good luck to you in the future.  Ripple going after banks may be the right play and they might win out.

140,I completely agree that we are in the very earliest stages.

Furthermore I think their approach to the crypto space is fairly enlightened. They understand the raw implications behind blockchain, cryptocurrency technology and the potential change it can bring to the world- in other words they were founded on solid principles of advancing the industry for the benefit of consumers.

if i were paying for power, the 1070s may have been the better move. for me, right now, a $90 used r9 fury is some of the best bang for buck out there, or used 580s because the $$ investment per hash is cheaper than newer, more powerful cards, and they depreciate much slower than newer cards.

i would personally buy used for sure. no sense paying a premium on something with a bloated ""new item"" price tag on it anyway.",,,,,,
9,Don't 1660Tis have a higher hash/watts ratio than 2070 Supers and every other card?,,,,,,
10,"> the 2070 Super will be more future proof with 8 gb of RAM, would sell better in a few years, and would not fill up my case as quickly. Do I go for resale value and future-proofing 

This one.",,,,,,
11,Definitely 2070 super. But I would look on the used market and maybe try to find one $450 or less. They are still new cards so it might be difficult to find one but this is definitely a better card than 1060tis,,,,,,
12,The 2060 super also has 8gb,,,,,,
13,Either 2070 super or just buy used gpus like another comment said. Def not 1660ti though,,,,,,
14,Thanks for the advice!  Unfortunately my power cost is around 0.09 cents per kwh.  I will also try to find something on the used market.  I think that I will take your word and go with the 2070 super.,,,,,,
15,Appreciated!  I will try and find something on the used market.,,,,,,
16,My problem though is that I can't buy two of those cards and I would still have an extra $100 that I couldn't use if I were to get one.  I also would not get quite the performance.  If you have a good solution though I would love to hear it!,,,,,,
17,Why not 1660Ti?,,,,,,
18,"at that power costs you won't make much of any profit after power, if you are choosing to GPU mine then you should look at mining as a way to subsidize the cost of your gaming rig, not a way to get rich. There is simply no real profit to be made, the cards depreciate faster then you earn back the purchase price.",,,,,,
19,"you should have been mining ETC with those, not XMR.  They were equally useless on CNR.",,,,,,
20,Eth,,,,,,
21,ETC or Eth. Maybe Zcash but haven't looked at Zcash for some time now!,,,,,,
22,"been useless for a long time, should have sold them before the randomX fork caused a flood of these garbage cards.",,,,,,
23,"I have read about having one GPU in the rig which has 4GB + of VRAM, makes other cards with less than 4GB of VRAM capable of mining ETH. Have not tested it though...",,,,,,
24,"I hear ya. I sold off all my ""good stuff"" beginning of the year, and was down to just let my leftover 2GB 460s/550s run til they died as CN specific miners.

Was glad for the extra month they could run due to fork delay, but landscape of trying to find a semi-profitable CN shitcoin to put them on instead definitely suggests I should pull the plug on them for good. They'd only fetch like $30 on eBay, and after probably $25 is fees and shipping, that essentially means I may as well just chuck them.

Been mining for a few years, so certainly made my profit and it's not like I need to stay running, but RX definitely put a kink into my plans of running til the wheels fell off.",,,,,,

55,"Tbh I just think for now it's either non-optimal drivers for this particular card, or basically a low quality product itself, being that it was a bargain of a price at which I got it brand new. But I'm leaning towards it being more of a driver issue, since I rather trust Gigabyte, and this is ""Revision 2.0"" of this particular GPU, which is apparently worldwide-new. I don't think I'm going to be asking for a refund or change of card, because I think it might be possible to optimize it in the future, with suitable drivers, and possibly, modding the BIOS with PBE, which is apparently only beginning to be supported for the RX 590s. My only hope is AMD wouldn't completely throw out the course Polaris' cards in pose of their newcoming cards. By this I mean I'm keeping my fingers crossed they will eventually come up with a good driver, and PBE will support this particular kind of Samsung VRAMs (K4G80325FC) which are in these new Gigabyte cards.

81,"if you aren't using your old gear you might consider trying to sell it while you can. 

last month i sold some spare parts I had lying around. i5 4690k, AsRock z97 extreme6 mobo, 8gb of DDR3 stable OC to 2666mhz, for $250. I then went to the local microcenter to buy a $159 Ryzen 7 2700x, but they had that for $129. I ended up with a ryzen 7 2700x, gigabyte b450 aorus pro wifi itx mobo, and 16gb of 3200mhz DDR 4 for $270.   
Traded way up and bought myself upgrade ability for $20.... side bonus, the ryzen 7 2700x mines randomx at 5kh/s at stock, at a lower power draw than a gpu. I have flat rate electricity, so I do mine my rx 580 that is in that machine with it, they combine for nearly .90 a day. rx 580 is still a great bang for buck card if you mod it to overclock on significantly lower power draw, given the low price ($120 or less used on ebay) and lower depreciation than newer cards.

I have another spare machine that is i7 4790k, same asrock z97 extreme6 mobo, same 8gb ram. i'll be selling that combo, for more money, and doing the same thing most likely. might do a 3000 series ryzen since the 2700x is back to $159. Maybe Ryzen 5 3600x for $199. We'll see. I'm not upgrading stuff to mine, but I will mine with the stuff I upgrade.",,,,,,

122," I have input for the PSU question.  
I have used 5 or 6 gold/plat PSU's in the past couple years and one PSU stood out beyond the rest for mining applications.  
The Enermax Platimax 850w Platinum , which i paid 200Cad for a couple years ago, is the best.

It  comes with more ports for 2+6pins, and while stock it comes with cables  for 6x 8pin, you can buy another cable for 20$ online and get a 4th set  on it. I can't stress how amazing that is, because without it,  3x1070ti's pull 125w each and doesnt even get close to 80%ing the 850w  range, even with the mobo on it. It was the only 850 capable of 4x8pin.  
The  next better thing about the Enermax over comparable plats like my  thermaltake 850 plat or the seagate 850 plat, is the power is split into  4 rails, instead of the 1 or two used by the others. This means a more  stable power wave when used by multiple cards. Mucho greatness. The  others are good, but not as good as this one.  
Not sure how much it's  worth now, or even if there is a gold version for 100$ somewhere, but  this Enermax was superior than the others.",,,,,,

2) Profit switching (maybe I'm looking in the wrong place?)  
3) Hidden fees or ability to change dev fee rates?   


Looks a lot like HIVE, $2/instance is same as HIVE. We have a hybrid environment: 1) dedicated rigs, 2) office machines, and 3) dual CPU servers (for XMR). With your current subscription plan offering, this type of hybrid config would not be profitable for us. (maybe we're not your target market?)

- temperature
- wattage
- built in tools
- RTX/GTX mixed rig fan control
- mining software updates w/o a new image
- install size
- load average 
- mobile applications
- live customer support community",,,,,,
234,"Answers below:
1.) Windows client coming soon. In testing right now.
2.) Profit switching will come in 3 ways. 1 pools that currently support it 2 nice hash support. Those are already supported. 3 is an in house built switcher we do not have open to the public yet.
3.) Mining software (Eg gminer, trex, etc) have their own dev fees and we prefer to allow them to collect those fees to continue their great dev work. Those fees are clearly laid out on those developers sites, we do not control them.

Hive is $3 per rig per month. Hashr8 OS is only $2. You also get 3 rigs free. 

We also have reduced dev fees for ASIC software (not the right community to talk ASICs though)",,,,,,

242,"There are still issues with RTX/GTX fan control on mixed rigs to my knowledge, we have users switching to our OS just to better manage those rigs. 

Most other Mining OSs are built on top of Ubuntu. This makes it about a 7GB install and uses way more CPU even when sitting idol. 

We custom built our Linux distribution to address this and other known memory leaks. This allows for an extremely low load average while mining with let's the CPU sit near idol reducing wattage used by the system at the wall. Anywhere from 10-50 watts per rig depending on your setup. Our total install is about 1GB. 

We are seeing rigs run 10%-20% cooler on our OS at the same hashrate do to kernel improvements and reduced waste heat from other componets. 

Our OS allows for new miners to be downloaded to the image without having to do a full OS upgrade. This is different, and it also allows for you to only have the miners you use installed on your device. 

We have a full working IOS and Android mobile application that includes push notifications for easier hands off management of rigs. 

It's 30% cheaper for miners with more than 3 rigs. 

If you want to see what it does differently or see what else the community has pointed out go check it out. This is just our first release. We have a ton more stuff coming in the next few weeks/months all of which will make it even more obvious what separates us from other mining OS.

I think most older household outlets in the US are wired for 15A, so 110V \* 15A = 1650 watts. Although I think you'll push your luck anywhere above 1450 watts. In the EU 230V @ 15A = 3450 watts",,,,,,
321,The cable was the same cable that came with the power supply from 3 years ago.,,,,,,
322,i agree. i live in a 1960s wired house. that was check and updated in the 80s in fl....,,,,,,
323,"The text 18AWGX3C is visible in the photo, which would suggest 18AWG wires inside the cable.

18AWG would according to https://www.stayonline.com/product-resources/reference-circuit-ampacity.asp suggest that it would be able to carry 10A.

Also the IEC 60320 C13 connector (the one which is burnt in the photo) is supposed to handle a maximum current of 10A.

Since the other end of the cable looks like an NEMA connector I'm going to assume US and 120V nominal mains voltage bit with 10% tolerance that would end up being in the range of 108-132V.

So based on the standard tolerances you would not expect the cable and connector to withstand more than a maximum of 108V*10A = 1080W.

And since power supplies are not 100% efficient, there has to be a bit more derating, for example the EVGA G3 specifies that it's minimum 90% efficient for 115VAC input, using these numbers we get 1080W*90% = 972W maximum power for the DC side of the power supply.

A GTX1070 seems to have a default power limit of around 150W, so if all 6 GPUs in the rig were maxing out then 900W would be needed for only the GPUs, + a bit of extra for mobo+cpu+ssd, an estimate would be in the interval of 50-100W for that.

These numbers sum up to an expected power usage of 950-1000W on the DC side of your powersupply, which with 90% efficiency becomes 1056-1111W on the AC side. Which is right around the maximum the cable and connector are rated for.",,,,,,

325,What power supply?,,,,,,
326,"> Also the IEC 60320 C13 connector (the one which is burnt in the photo) is supposed to handle a maximum current of 10A.

You can use this connector for up to 16A (https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/1452), and that's the issue.  I've seen PSUs using C13 connectors with rated loads that are over 10A (@120V) and those come with cables also rated for 16A.

Based on your math he's marginal on whether or not it's an acceptable cable for the load.  It's definitely not oversized, that's for sure.",,,,,,

Not sure what this ""Counselor"" thing you speak of is or what is going on that makes you think you made 15 MILLION DOLLARS in 1 day, there is only 37 Million Dollars worth of Grin in Existence today and that coin has been around for like a year, even if you had every GPU in the world you couldn't mine that much in 1 day from 1 coin.",,,,,,

405,"He probably try to said in case if you have AMD , since they aren't good at progpow , if you have seen or mine  BCI then you will notice this.",,,,,,
406,"ProgPOW heavily favors GDDR6 cards, a 2060 does DOUBLE the hashrate of a 570 4GB and then some and does so with a higher Mh/w see the charts here https://1stminingrig.com/whats-up-with-progpow-benchmarks-addressing-the-criticisms/#Nvidia_GPUs_ProgPow_Hashrate_Benchmarks

so newer GPU's are going to be significantly faster (an RX 570 and a 2060 pull very near the same performance on ETHash today) and more energy efficient while doing so, how profitable it will be for older cards depends entirely on how much of the current hashrate is coming from ASIC's.

You also have to factor in with the upcoming Monero fork (in less then 2 weeks) a SIGNIFICANT Number of GPU's (on the order of 100's of thousands of GPU's which are mostly AMD) will be forced elsewhere as Monero becomes no longer profitable to mine and those GPU's will have to go somewhere.

Yes ProgPOW should make mining more profitable but in the mean time it's gonna get a lot worse and when ProgPOW does come along there is gonna be a lot of hashrate looking for a home and so any profits there are to make with it will likely be short lived as with every other GPU supporting coin fork we've seen over the last 2 years, it only stays profitable until people hear about it and move their rigs over, at best (unless like 50%+ of Eth hashrate is coming from ASIC's) we will see 2 weeks of profitability before things drop back to where they are now.",,,,,,

420,"There is almost no single GPU out there that will yield more than $1USD/day running the full 24 hours. The only two that get reasonably close are the Radeon VII and 2080 TI. The 2080 TI can do over $1/day on some coins at the moment. These boards are crazy expensive. In the realm of mining straight 24/7 for 2+ years before the card pays itself off not counting electricity. And this assumes no other hardware failures.

Sorry. I think you'd be best served with a used RX 570/580 that is flashed and configured for etherum mining. You'll make very little but it's efficient and a used board runs like $120 now. It'll at least get your foot in the door and be a great learning experience. From there you can decide if you want something a little more beefy.",,,,,,
421,"First, I would recommend you visit whattomine.com. This will give you a good understanding of profitability for a variety of cards. Of money isn't an option, there are high end cards like the Radeon 7 or the RTX 2080ti or 2070 super cards. Look into which algorithm the card is best at and go from there. You want to mine a coin and then exchange it to Bitcoin which will then be exchanged to Fiat by coinbase or something like that. A popular wallet is Exodus but based on the coin, you might need to get a different wallet. Visit miningpoolhub to get a list of pools for each coin and they can help you get started on how to program your  miner. aio miner is a good starting miner. It will help you learn the basics of mining programs but after a while, it might be better to download individual miners. But do your research and make your best guess. overall, do your research and choose a card that will give you the best return on investment time and good resale value after your done with it. Happy mining.",,,,,,
422,"First, check NiceHash profitability calculator: https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator

I recommend you using NiceHash(I work for NiceHash). I am confident to say that NiceHash Miner is the most profitable way to mine. Also, pretty simple. 

NiceHash works as a broker of hashing power. We connect buyers of hashing power and sellers(you). Buyers buy hashing power on the open marketplace, where they ""fight"" over hashrate. A lot of times, buyers are willing to pay more for an MH/s than that MH/s would earn if mining directly to pool. That is why, you earn more with NiceHash.

510,"I do Awesome Miner, using mining pool hub, Nicehash, and a grin pool. I convert my Grins to ETH or BTC. I keep most of the alt coins I mine on mining pool hub, auto deposited to my Exodus wallets. Coins I don't have wallets for, I auto convert, usually into ETH (in MPH automatically). NH of course pays out in BTC.

&#x200B;

All into Exodus, which I periodically transfer into alt coins that are down. I've bought a few penny coins that went up a few thousand percent. I try to keep most of my holdings in BTC and a few other big alt coins.",,,,,,
511,"Some pools can do this for you. Most popular options (excl NiceHash) are MiningPoolHub, ZergPool and ZPool",,,,,,
512,"if you are doing profit switching and NOT converting to BTC then you are failing, the whole concept of profit switching is to convert out of the coin to something more stable. If you are worried about Fees then don't use Betterhash although I don't see any mention of a fee for that on their platform.

as for ""damage"" well that depends if you have it confirgured right, a proper mining setup reduces the Power Limit on Nvidia cards or Voltage on AMD cards resulting in the card running much cooler then if it was being overclocked and used for gaming, now if you are using your gaming OC settings to mine you are likely frying your hardware from the temps they are running at.

Another thing you should be worried about, since you are worried about fees and such is the COST the POWER to mine is costing you, you want to make sure the cost to mine is less then what you are earning otherwise you are losing money.",,,,,,
513,What program are you using?,,,,,,
514,"The difference is convenience versus versatility.  By converting to BCH you save yourself the hassle of trying to find an exchange to sell yourself but at the cost of fees.  But also know if you try and sell yourself you have to often register, go through KYC, and you won’t get what you think as there’s inevitably a fee to sell as well.

To be honest the difference unless you’re running a huge mining farm will most likely be minimal.  Say you’re mining $2-6 a day, the difference is not that much.  Unless you’re hopeful that the altcoin that you mine will 10x, I’m all for converting to whichever you want.  Some altcoins are so small that it’s not on a big enough exchange or you won’t see enough trading volume.  I have coins that I don’t think I’ll ever be able to offload.  For instance there’s coins that I’ve mined and though I could easily sell.  But after finding an exchange I was surprised that I received around 10% than I was expecting.  Right now my coin of choice is BCH over BTC.  

Also run your own calculations.  I’ve calculated that for auto converting with my modest rigs I’m around $6-6.50 a day using Zergpool and auto converting to BCH.  For the next week or so going to try putting my GPU on ethash and my a9 on equihash on NiceHash and my other rigs on Odocrypt mining Digibyte direct to see if there’s a noticeable difference.",,,,,,
515,Bring MTP back,,,,,,
516,"I appreciate your response. I don’t have my pc OC at all and am running everything on standard settings. Your explanation of the BTC conversion was definitely a “come to Jesus moment” for me if you will. I needed it explained like that to realize that I am indeed failing so I turned that setting back on. 

In regards to power I am blessed to be living in Washington State in an apartment complex. I’m not sure how it is elsewhere but electricity is paid communally meaning the electricity company looks at the electricity consumption for the whole building and then charges everyone the same amount. 

I am wondering if I should switch over to NiceHash but figure I should use BetterHash for at least a month before making a switch. That’s a whole different discussion in itself.",,,,,,
517,I’m currently using BetterHash.,,,,,,
518,"To anyone reading this, never ever heed his advice about auto converting to BCH. The pairing availability of BCH is abysmally little and BCH has low liquidity, resulting you actually got way less than what you mined.

Also, holding BCH means getting poorer overtime. BCH went from 1:0.2BTC to 1:0.027BTC rendering you poorer than what you can mine.",,,,,,
519,"> am running everything on standard settings

even that can be a bad thing, HEAT is your biggest concern to longevity of hardware even running at stock settings, stock settings also are NOT optimal, time and time again it's proven you can get higher earnings by reducing the power then tweaking the Mem and Core speeds to what is optimal for the hardware you have, take this post here for example https://old.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/dpiw02/gtx_1660_super_mining_hashrates_stock_settings/ at stock settings the GPU mined Eth at 26.3 MH/s but with tweaking he got up to 30.3 (greater then a 10% increase) while reducing the power draw which means more profits with less heat. You should do research into whats the optimal settings for the kind of GPU you have, CPU mining isn't worth the effort even in your case because there just isn't any earnings worth a damn, but that will change at the end of the month.

>I am wondering if I should switch over to NiceHash

the benefit there is you get paid based on submitted shares (pieces of work that eventually lead to a block being solved) which IMHO is better for someone that isn't committed to 24/7 mining, you are also directly selling your shares for BTC instead of going through a delayed conversion process, profit switching needs that instant conversion and you don't typically see that with the auto-convert pools, generally what will happen with those pools is you will earn X amount of a coin based on the work you did then you have to wait for X number of confirmations before you can actually do something with that coin (this can take several hours) then you send it off to trade for BTC at the market price then you wait for the BTC to confirm in, in all this delay can cause what was most profitable to no longer be better by the time the exchange occurs, Nicehash cuts all that out by paying you directly for your shares so the only question with them comes down to are buyers paying market value for the hashrate or can you make more mining elsewhere.",,,,,,
520,Never did I say that BCH is the highest profitable coin to exchange.  You’re free to choose whichever coin you want to mine or trade into.  If it was all about the most profitable then no one would ever mine/trade into the smaller coins and we’d all mine the same coin.,,,,,,
521,"You may want to ditch it for OverdriveNTool. Much easier to set core and memory clocks, and undervolts like a champ.

If they run all the time it will bleed. It's non-conductive so it shouldn't cause issues. 

It can cause extra dust to stick to the board though. 

If you want to clean it up and delay it from coming back you can replace the thermal tape on the boards and clean the substance off. 

It's not a bad idea to reapply thermal paste once in a while anyway so you can replace the thermal tape at the same time.",,,,,,

663,"I believe the 8-pin VGA cable can take handle at least 225W, based on that link in this subreddit wiki..

Another reason to believe is is they come with 2x6+2 cables, so why would the manufacturer give that extra 8-pin connector if the cable can't handle it?

What doesn't make sense is why they come with 2x6+2 cables if, as that page says, they are only rated for 288W (and not 2x150W).

Any more insights appreciated..",,,,,,
664,"Re: the 80% rule, ok that would rule out 20AWG, fair enough.  Still, not sure why you're saying to completely avoid splitters, or not trust in the PSU cables.",,,,,,
665,"According to the PCI-E specification, an 8-pin PCI-E power connector is rated at 150W. So a PSU manufacturer doesn't necessarily design for the connectors or cables to handle more than the specification. 

That link specifically states:

>First let's be clear that PCI-SIG lists the maximum rating of its 6-pin PCI-e connector at 75 watts, and its 8-pin PCI-e connector at 150 watts. That is the safe rating, and you go any higher than that at your own risk.",,,,,,
666,">not sure why you're saying to completely avoid splitters, or not trust in the PSU cables.

Experience. I have melted power connectors trying to push them beyond their specification. If any connection or wire feels even barely warm to the touch, it's carrying too much power. Even with a pricey trusted premium brand power supply like Seasonic, that doesn't mean the wire size or connectors are rated for exceeding the PCI-E specification. Honestly that website saying you can push 288W through an 8-pin PCI-E power connector is irresponsible and dangerous.

717,"I have input for the PSU question.  
I have used 5 or 6 gold/plat PSU's in the past couple years and one PSU stood out beyond the rest for mining applications.  
The Enermax Platimax 850w Platinum , which i paid 200Cad for a couple years ago, is the best.

It comes with more ports for 2+6pins, and while stock it comes with cables for 6x 8pin, you can buy another cable for 20$ online and get a 4th set on it. I can't stress how amazing that is, because without it, 3x1070ti's pull 125w each and doesnt even get close to 80%ing the 850w range, even with the mobo on it. It was the only 850 capable of 4x8pin.   
The next better thing about the Enermax over comparable plats like my thermaltake 850 plat or the seagate 850 plat, is the power is split into 4 rails, instead of the 1 or two used by the others. This means a more stable power wave when used by multiple cards. Mucho greatness. The others are good, but not as good as this one.   
Not sure how much it's worth now, or even if there is a gold version for 100$ somewhere, but this Enermax was superior than the others.",,,,,,

A key to crytocurrency in my opinion is that running a node, mining, and acquiring it is available to all. Until we know for sure something better than GPU mining is effective, prevalent, and tested, I like the idea of GPU mining.

766,"the good days where in excess of $10 a day per 1080ti back in January 2018, it's actually what tricked the then relative mining newb ME into expanding to more cards, in the week it took for my next 2 cards to show up dollar earnings had cut in HALF.

Do I think those days will ever return, NO I most definitely do not, the market is very different then it was 2 years ago, many major algorithms have fallen to ASIC Miners, Some Coins are switching to algo's where modern CPU's give much higher returns for the wattage used and there has been significant development in non-POW based consensus algorithms that could very likely make mining a thing of the past entirely. I think there is the possibility of 1 last surge in GPU Mining coming from the Q1 Ethereum fork to ProgPOW but how good that will be depends on what percentage of the current hashrate is ASIC's, if it's a small percentage there will be a small increase for a while until more miners switch GPU's back over and drive it back down, if it's a significant percentage it could possibly spur a small boom for GPU Mining, but the real shocker is gonna be the day Ethereum makes the move to POS, once that happens GPU Mining is dead, if even HALF the Ethereum hashrate is GPU's and those GPU's need to move somewhere else we are talking about the equivalent hashing power of like 800,000 Radeon VII's having to find a new home, thats a LOT of hashing power to have to move around and after that you are gonna need power costs below like 3-4 cents per KwH to turn a profit until a significant portion of GPU's are shut off and sold off.

795,It does. Alot of the luls in crypto prices has to do with flushing out inefficient miners. I doubt Eth will inherently see a value increase alone. I think it will ride Bitcoins back for a time. Another issue is I dont see Eth getting more scarce unless a change/update draws floods of developers in buying lots of Ethereum in order to build their projects(2017). It is an ever changing circulating amount so scarcity isnt neccassarily a direct influence on value. But it could become more valuable as countries start accepting blockchain research/development. I know alot of Bitcoin/crypto noobs turn to Ethereum because it’s easier to get into. As the industry grows I believe many will continue to believe and purchas Ethereum just because it does reach to more users with less investment capital.,,,,,,

841,"Temperature fluctuations and uneven temperature distribution would be the biggest things for me. Air temp can change pretty quickly and uneven head distribution and frost melting near the internals of your case is what would be my primary concern. (Eg. Top of case gets cold enough to form frost on the outside also means it can form frost on the inside). 

Personally I would build a wood enclosure and pipe in the cold air, a custom enclosed case also gives you the opportunity to build in some sound deadening and airflow paths, just make sure to insulate the incoming air pipe and the like (you also got me thinking about how to build one for my servers just to keep the noise down). If you insist on running them outside however I wouldn't run them open air and custom build a case to force airflow through the GPU's first then through everything and make sure the air inside remains above freezing at all times. Probably double insulated because I'm a little paranoid if the air temp jumps up past freezing before any passively heated parts do. Some additional research might also be helpful on how electronics are built to withstand temperature variations as there might also be thermal expansion issues between the PCB's and solder joints if the gap is too wide. Looking at how phase change and ln2 overclockers mitigate condensation might also be useful, pretty sure I've seen some other people consider it or put their rigs in an uninsulated garage for similar effect over the years so there might be a video or two as well.

Additionally I don't live in a climate that gets below freezing so I'm going with best guesses and half remembered discussions. 

This is pretty much just a completely crazy idea but it is possible to build a completely sealed system for use outdoors and use a heat exchanger setup to cool off the internal air. My initial thought was using two radiators filled with antifreeze (car or PC) to pass the cooling through without much worry about condensation buildup given a good seal. A good airflow path and properly sized radiator and internal air would sit close if not at the same as outside. It might even be possible to skip the liquid heat transfer entirely and use an old car intercooler to just cool the air directly. Probably would require a larger set of fans for proper airflow but about the same sort of effort given the work sealing in the rig.",,,,,,

845,"Drop the 1050Ti, these cards are **total garbage** for mining.

**1070Ti** are definitely the best cards in terms of price per hash per watt. They've been the miner's choice for a long time as they're very efficient and versatile (except ETH). You can't go wrong with it.

**1660Ti** are decent cards, but they will be less efficient than 1070Ti on most algos. 1070Ti has 2432 CUDA cores whereas 1660 Ti only has 1536, and even if the 1660 has GDDR6 memory instead of the 1070Ti's GDDR5, it will still lag behind the 1070Ti, both in terms of hashrate and power efficiency.

To sum it up, if I were you I'd go for a full 1070Ti rig.

Broadly speaking, keep in mind that it's much easier to use only one model of GPUs for your rig.

And don't build rigs with low-end cards like 1050Ti just because they're cheap and you can buy a lot of them. It's a beginner mistake. It's better (and more profitable) to buy higher-end cards like the 1070Ti or 1080Ti, even if you start with only 2 or 3 cards.

If the 2060 is the same price than a 1070 Ti, it's a tough choice. The 2060 has GDDR6 and the resell value will probably be higher in a year or two, compared to a 1070 Ti, BUT it has only 6 GB of RAM compared to the 1070 Ti (which has 8 GB) and 1920 cores vs 2432 for the 1070 Ti.

The very best would be if you can go for a RTX 2060 **Super**. It has 2176 cores and 8 GB of RAM, so it's equivalent to a 1070 Ti (still has less cores though), and to a RTX 2070.

Looking at Ebay 1950x's seam to be selling at about the $300 + Shipping and a brand new 3700X is $330, then factor in the costs of Mobo's and you are basically coming out even except you are getting brand new parts instead of used parts and the parts are newer and faster.",,,,,,

If you have enabled 4g decoding, then try experimenting with gen speed. Set it to gen1, gen2 or gen3.

In Windows, delete drivers with DDU(Display Driver Uninstaller), restart the rig and then install the latest drivers. If this did not help, uninstall drivers, shut down rig and connect only 1 GPU, install drivers again, shut down rig add another GPU, install drivers again and repeat until all GPUs are recognized.",,,,,,

921,"undervolt your card, you are mining at a loss without it, see your Nicehash window, it is literally showing you are -0.23 everyday..

after undervolt you slowly up your core, +15 at a time and bench it with your hashrate.

also, check if you are mining x16r2 or x16r? x16r is ridden with asic, you will never see profit mining that algo.",,,,,,
922,I am having trouble zooming in. What is the hashrate? Is that a 1660? 1660ti?,,,,,,
923,My 1660 non Ti with 75% power +100 on the core and -502 memory does 17-18mhs avg on T-Rex miner,,,,,,
924,Why aren't you using your CPU?,,,,,,
925,My 1050ti seems to be pulling over double them numbers something isn't right,,,,,,
926,Average,,,,,,
927,"That's weird. I get between 18-21MH/s on my 1660Ti, but I'm not using NH, I'm using the newest T-Rex on Suprnova",,,,,,
928,"well first NEVER EVER EVER run at 100% power limit, even if your temps are fine the power draw creative to hashrate isn't worth it, beyond that it looks like you are on X16r which you shouldn't be on, Ravencoin (the most valuable coin) forked off of X16r to X16rV2, if you do not have X16rV2 in your algo list then you need to update the build of Nicehash you are using, there are now ASIC's all over the old X16r coins and as such there is no money to be made, you could also do with some tuning of your GPU in general, 0 and 0 is not where you want your core and mem clocks at. Also the X16 algo's have a wildly varying hashrate that changes every minute or so so a small snapshot like this doesn't paint the entire picture.",,,,,,
929,"To mine successfully, you have to:

1. Overclock your GPU's memory (for ETH algo)
2. Undervolt the GPU core (to save on electricity)

Here is a complete mining guide which I used to boost mine: [https://cryptoit.blogspot.com/2018/08/how-to-undervolt-nvidia-1060-1070-1080ti.html](https://cryptoit.blogspot.com/2018/08/how-to-undervolt-nvidia-1060-1070-1080ti.html) (it works the same on 1660Ti too)",,,,,,
930,"Update NHM.

You are probably using some old NHM version, which still supports X16R(old one). Raven forked from X16R to X16Rv2. We have removed X16R from the newer versions.

Make sure that you download NHM from here:

937,because unless he is paying less the 5 cents per KWH he would be losing money for the next month until RandomX comes along.,,,,,,
938,What clock settings?,,,,,,
939,"That is usually true, except for Grin.  I've noted that hash rates on Grin31 scale relatively proportionally to the power utilization.  Thus mining at 100% power limit makes sense, if you have the right kind of PSU to supply that power consistently and safely.  I tried running at 105% for a while, but cut back because I hadn't spec'ed the PSUs to be able to handle that much power (because I, like you, expected to undervolt).  Nevertheless, it continued to scale up even beyond 100%.",,,,,,

945,"stock mem/core on x16rv2 
power is at like 90%",,,,,,
946,"Yes Grin does scale the best but it's still not 100% linearly and even then if you are mining on Nicehash like the OP is you don't want to have your GPU's at 100% power limit for all the other algo's as it bounces between algo's, you gotta find that ""sweet spot"" settings that can be used for virtually any algo in the top 5 earning algo's.",,,,,,
947,Does it have silver around the fans?,,,,,,
948,"I wouldn't, it definitely is NOT profitable, not for another month, I was big into CPU Mining last year when a CPU like this would bring in well over a dollar a day by itself, I was earning enough from my CPU's (across my rigs) to cover my power costs leaving the GPU's as pure profit. But then difficulty kept rising as more and more GPU's came into Monero and the other Cryptonight coins, with how things are now CPU's like this are constantly getting disconnected from teh server because they haven't submitted a share within the time window Nicehash gives and in reality your CPU earnings are about 40% LESS then what the Nicehash Miner shows as your estimated daily earnings (I was able to track this very closely on the old Nicehash Platform because my CPU's where the only thing that mined the Cryptonight algo since I'm all Nvidia GPU's and so I was able to compare my actual earnings to what the miner showed, the Difficulty is simply too high to make money with anything short of a Ryzen 9 3900X and even then you are spending $500 on a CPU that can be out performed by a $200 GPU until the RandomX fork next month.",,,,,,
949,"properly configured thats closer to another 70 watts and the earnings on it are crap, trust me i have a Ryzen 7 1700, i've done the math.",,,,,,
950,Yes,,,,,,
951,"What all y'all are failing to recognize is that profitability SHOULD NOT MATTER when you're talking about freaking  20 cents a day. Run the son of a bitch and eat the few dollars in the short term. Mining won't be practical forever. God forbid the OP loses 10 cents a day until RandomX comes out. Oh, the humanity??? How will he afford to feed his kitties!!! Lol.",,,,,,
952,"For 200 bones, you can run the 2700x. I think it benchmarks at half of what the 3900x does, but hell, mining is a boring hobby, just run any Ryzen and you got a dog in the hunt. I can't justify buying a 3900x, as I just don't care that much. A pre-owned 1700 will do just fine.",,,,,,
953,"There is no math to do , looks you haven't researched at all. You can't mine when value of the coin is higher,  you don't even have an idea how much difficult goes up once a coin get a good price. 
I mine a loss but is low difficulty too",,,,,,
954,"PROFITABILITY IS KEY!!!!!!!!! Profitability doesn't mean that you are selling, it means that you are acquiring the MAXIMUM amount of the coin for the dollar investment.

WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU MINE AT A LOSS, THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING YOU COULD DO.

956,Depends on the conductors in the cables...  I would assume they are NOT rated for 13A if they have a 5A fuse by default.   I would recommend not using them w 13A fuses.  Sorry.  Not the answer you wanted to hear but not worth starting a fire to save a few bucks.,,,,,,
957,"unlikely, only reason they would have a lower fuse in them is because they are thinner wire not capable of handling the higher current.",,,,,,
958,"UK - the majority of those leads I've seen/dealt with are made for low current, the copper in there is basically the bare minimum they can get away with. 

Rewirable IEC female and a 13a plug is about £2, 3 core 2.5mm is less than £2 a meter. That's what I do so I can have the lead as long/short as I need it, at those prices why risk it.",,,,,,
959,The amp rating of the cable is written on the three pin end....,,,,,,
960,"A wires amp rating is based on the wire gauge and in special circumstances that don't apply here, the insulating material. Fuses are determined based on the intended load at the end of the wire but it is safe to assume a manufacture wouldn't waste too much money oversizing the wire. If you can guess the gauge you can look up the amp rating all over the internet by searching ""wire AWG table"". If you have a hand held ohm meter you can measure the resistance and the length of a wire in your cable and figure out the gauge with the information in the same AWG tables. As a last resort you could just try it, put your computer under full power load and feel how hot the wire gets. If it gets hot, don't use it. It won't instantly burst into flames or anything.",,,,,,
961,Don't do it.  Even if they work they will get hot and eventually give issues.,,,,,,
962,"Do not cheap out and do this. 

If the draw is high, a cable rated to 5A could melt or start a fire before the 13A fuse would pop and prevent it.

We had this sort of thing highlighted as dangerous and requiring an immediate fix in a UK landlords electrical safety report (30A cable, 40A fuse)",,,,,,

967,It's a UK thing,,,,,,

970,"you need to research ProgPOW for Ethereum and RandomX for XMR.  You may want to look at CPU mining instead of GPU mining.  If you want to go the GPU route, look into cards with GDDR6, they hash better on the upcoming algos.  Based on what you have up there, you want the 1660 TIs, as they are the only ones with GDDR6.  Also look at whattomine.com",,,,,,
971,"Don't get it if you are sleeping in the same room as the mining rig, it will disrupt your sleep and make your room very hot in summer. If you want to mine I would get a gaming PC with a 2080ti that you can leave on at night, it won't get too much space and it won't make much noise or heat. Plus you can game on it and have fun. 
There are no profits at the moment even with free electricity it's not worth it, especially if you plan to sell every month..to get less than 100$. Not worth it",,,,,,
972,Many colleges will have no mining clauses in the contracts for living on campus.,,,,,,
973,"I disagree with all the other comments here about 'profitability' and 'coin prices'. Let me be clear: by building this rig, the value you will get from the coins mined is insignificant.  Forget about potential profit, market conditions and electric costs. The **real** value in owning a mining rig is that you gain technical knowledge, experience and opportunities. It's clear that the blockchain industry isn't going to get any smaller than it is right now. The only way is up.

I was around your age when I built my first rig with 3 R9 270's, for mining LTC and Dogecoin. That rig only earned me $1000. But by getting into the crypto industry, and starting bigger and bigger farms after that, I invested in my skills. In the end, the value I gained from mining is set to be thousands of dollars a year. I put myself on the fast track to a high-paying job straight out of college. The funny thing is that I lost $20,000 from my third farm, but those losses will be recouped in a few years because of the higher salary I can get.

So go ahead and assemble the rig, and don't worry about the profit or losses. In college, you can gain a few friends by showing off your rig and hardware skills. If you're going to major in computer science, your rig is a platform for running cryptography, AI, and deep learning programs on. Forget about a few hundred bucks of gains/losses and focus on the long term bottom line.

I think GTX 1660 Ti's are a good choice to keep power usage down, but you could try used GTX 1060's or 1070's. But I recommend nVidia no matter what, since a lot of big data applications are built around CUDA, and the newer coin algorithms favor nVidia.

However, be careful mining at college:

* Some dormitory rooms share branch circuits. This is especially for older dorm hall buildings from the 1960s-1980s. If another kid nearby runs a vacuum cleaner or space heater, you could trip the breaker. If you trip the breaker too many times, you could get discovered.
* Your college might have a policy against mining. If you're caught, you could even be kicked out of on-campus housing
* You need to attach a kill-a-watt meter to your rig, and balance the load of all your appliances. You need to pause your mining rig whenever you use a microwave or hairdryer
* You won't be able to mine 24/7 if it gets too hot inside your dorm room. If you have a roommate, don't expect anything.
* In your case, you won't really profit much from the free power. Electricity is pennies compared to knowledge/experience. Consider keeping your rig at your parent's house and remoting into it",,,,,,
974,Skip the rigs for now. If you think crypto is going to go up buy some now while it's down. Use the profits to get yourself a nice laptop for school.,,,,,,
975,"Maybe you will understand it in monetary terms.
1 card if u lucky will make about $0.30 a day...now what you paying for a 6 card rig and how long will it take to pay itself off at those rates?",,,,,,
976,"Lol I was literally in your shoes a few years ago, if you want to start mining college is the time to do it with that sweet sweet free electricity. Here’s the break down. 1660s are a great choice at current market standings. With 2 you’ll make about 60 cents a day. With 5 rx580, remember to get the 8gb cards if you choose this path, you’ll be making around $1.70 a day. Seems like an easy choice right? Eeehhhh the draw backs of rx580s is that you will need a big power supply to power them, over 1000w psu, which is pricy(look up power consumptions charts for accurate number) Also your room will become an oven because the cards get hot which then leads to the fans roaring while you try to sleep and your life will be miserable, trust me because that’s literally what I did for over a year. Honestly, I would go with the 1660s because they will make you less miserable and may prove to be the better investment in the long run. But at the end of the day, youre a grown boy now you gotta make the choices. Also here is a list of parts you will need and the guesstimated prices.

Motherboard: 80$

979,1660ti's are good choice if you are going to mine CN-GPU (Ryocurrency ),,,,,,

It doesn't matter what the 580's are mining (which is why I never said they where mining Monero, FYI), the earnings on CPU's are gonna be stupid high for Ryzen Owners and since farms aren't gonna upgrade CPU's it's the perfect time for a small scale single rig miner to make a little money.",,,,,,

The extra risk will negate the extra profit, then.

>you think farms are gonna be able to find 100's of them or hell even dozens of them?

This is the only good reason I can find that supports your argument. This is exactly what happened in Q3 2017. Existing benchmarks show that AMD is 50-70% faster than Intel's 14nm+++ 9th gen CPUs with the same cores/threads. I think it's because Zen 2 has large cache. But Intel plans to cut prices in half, so I don't know if that will change anything.

Even then, I think individual gamers with Ryzen 3000 CPUs will have the biggest advantage. They already bought their rig for gaming anyway, which means they didn't take any risk. A commercial farm won't be at an advantage because they can only have one CPU per rig, and they're shouldering all the risk of having just 1-2 coins available. If there are quantity limits on the R9 3900x/3950x, then large operations won't be able to order so many of them. In February 2018, I had to deal with maximum quantities even from wholesale distributors.

>Farms aren't gonna take a risk and spend a thousand dollars per machine to upgrade to R9 3900X's

Agreed. The gamers who bought R9 3900x's and attached RGB lights and liquid coolers to them will make a killing.

For me, a mining rig has to not only make profit after electricity, but pay for itself and the risks it involves. I need a 30% return on the hardware per year and 25% to compensate for the risk of mining. So a $1000 rig needs to make $550/year, or $1.50/day. A R9 3900x uses $0.20 of power/day at 8¢/kWh. It makes $0.46/day of revenue on CNr. That number would need to quadruple for me to consider building the rig. And once you factor in the risk of RandomX, I would need a little more profit. We're not considering the extra depreciation risk of CPUs these days. AMD is making big advancements every generation.

Conclusion: RandomX revenue needs to be 5-6x as high as CNr currently is for commercial farms to consider investing in it.

Yes, you can add GPUs to the rig to make it more worthwhile. Or you can drop that 3900x into an existing rig for $600-650 of total cost. So now the 3900x needs to make $1.18/day of revenue, which is still 2-3x as high as CNr today.",,,,,,
999,"> Conclusion: RandomX revenue needs to be 5-6x as high as CNr currently is for commercial farms to consider investing in it.

comparing current 3900X benchmarks to Vega 64's (puts 3900X's about 65% the hashrate of a Vega64) and knowing post the post fork hashrates put 3900X's 10-11 times the speed of a Vega 64 the math says that at least initially a 3900X should be 6.5-7.5 times more profitable (before power) then it is right now, not accounting for new machines that will come online due to the increased profitability.

Except that most farms are running budget Celerons in 1151 boards so in order to swap over to a 3900X there will have to be MOBO upgrades and possibly PSU upgrades depending on how the rig is configured as you will now have the added wattage of a CPU mining that you didn't have",,,,,,

Yes, that's right. I was giving the best case example, where a farm owner used cheap B450 AM4 motherboards and low cost $40-50 AM4 processors. 80% of farm owners would have to replace the whole platform if they wanted to install a R9 3900x.

I'd argue that it's time to stop building Intel Celeron platform rigs, and switch over to AMD. Their low end CPUs are now cheaper than Intel's. Back in 2017-2018, you couldn't find an AM4 CPU for < $100, but now you can.",,,,,,

One of the other hurdles back then was also the lack of integrated graphics, now that there are $40 AMD CPU's that have integrated graphics there is no reason to do an intel system if building new, but this is more about what the current state of the mining scene is and the overwhelming majority are those celeron guys.",,,,,,

1131,"Just because your daily revenue clears the power cost doesn't mean mining is a good idea. You have to make sure your daily profit is enough to give you a decent return on the hardware.

For me, I would only build a GPU rig if it could return 30% + 25% on the hardware. The 30% is the average depreciation of GPU rigs per year, and I add a 25% discount rate to reflect the high risk and changing conditions of this industry. 55% x $1000 = $550 per year. So if the rig costs $1000, I would need $1.50/day of profit to justify the fact that the rig's value is going down by 0.1% a day, and the risks of building it.

For $1000, I could build a rig with 7 RX 570's, and each one would mine $0.30/day of ETH or XMR. The rig would earn $2.10/day of revenue. In order to earn the required profit, the power cost would have to be < $0.60/day. 120w/card x 7 cards x 24 hours = 20.16 kWh/day. That means the highest electric rate I can have is 2.97¢/kWh. Even the cheapest regions of the world cost 3.5-5¢, and my power is 16-18¢. So I would not build the rig. I would only build it if the revenue was $4.93+/day for the rig, or 2.5x as high as right now.

Stop with the bullshit. I ran a mining operation and I can promise you that mining IS ALWAYS more stressful than gaming. 

You dont game 24/7/365 , but you do mine non stop. 

I had PLENTY of cards leaking oil from memory thermal pads and fans that would stop working. You could often tell because the bearings would squeal for some time. Fans DO fail and mining causes it. 

The GPU itself might not be damaged, but the cards have miles on them, make no mistake. Thermal grease can dry up too leading to increased temps.",,,,,,
1164,"That's what I thought. What's Nvidia's main market? AI. AI arguably pushes card harder than mining ever could. Gaming stresses a card the same amount if not harder than mining, thus why risers use 1 PCIe lane instead of all 16.

It is anecdotal, I know, but those with bigger farms can give much better anecdotes than mine.

Fans do fail from time to time, but in general having stable voltage at good temperatures is no much different than having a card staying idle. It is also how server farms can stay online for decades even, with relatively minimal damages: good ventilation, stable voltage.",,,,,,

1169,"You are honestly the first that runs a mining operation that tells me this.

All the people I know run them in well ventilated areas where the temperatures (of the cards) do not extend a certain threshold which can cause the issues you are talking about.

My understanding is that they keep the temps to 60 C or less which is similar to the idle temperatures in many cards (low 50s in some places).

So yes, according to a c certain use that you can possibly do to cards mining is less stressful than regular gaming (which extends temperatures to highs 70s or 80s, or indeed non-stable voltage).

In my very limited experience, my gaming card died before my ""mining card"" due to the above issues.

But yeah I did leave a window for improper use during mining, which can -indeed- trash the cards. Obviously mining can be card for your card(s), I wrote that if done in a certain way it won't. Last guy I talked to had 300 cards running for 3 years only 3 developed issues. That ' s a turnaround of 1 card per 100. Yeah, that's better than gaming in them.",,,,,,
1170,"if you dont underclock and undervolt and make a decent fan curve (not 100% fan), then you are effectively running your GPU too hard and it will diminish its lifespan by a lot.  If you run a GPU 100% load at 50c with 40% fans and very low voltage, and lower clocks then it will not diminish its lifespan vs gaming.  whether its using pcix1 or x3 doesnt make a difference, thats just bandwidth.",,,,,,
1171,"AI is supposedly done by professionals, so no improper care of the cards. Mining is a semi industrial activity often done by amateurs. But so is gaming, especially serial gaming, so really the only way to lose your warranty is by telling them. 

BTW what can trash a card has nothing to do with bandwidth, it has more to do with sudden changes in voltage and/or high temperatures, both can possibly allow electron tunneling which -if done enough- affect the proper functions of the card.

But like I said gaming does way more of the above than (proper) mining where voltages are generally stable (coin switching can be bad for a card though, NiceHash and the likes, in the long term) and temperatures as well can be withing certain limits without sudden spikes in either direction.

IMO most mining ""accidents"" have/had to do with improper handling / static prevention than the actual mining process. Most people have few ideas how to properly ground their custom rigs which as well can create issues long term. But again, it is not ""mining's fault""",,,,,,
1172,"I know. I have no idea why I said that, and I hate that I did",,,,,,
1173,"The fans will always been an issue, they will always be on. 

As for the temps, it all depends on what algo you mine and what brand cards you have. I ran Nvidia, where you could not run some ultra low voltage BIOS for Eth only. I dual mined too so the cards were maxing out. 

All depends but fans are pretty much a guaranteed issue.",,,,,,

1194,"Genuine question here, why did you make a second version for free when you also have a paid one for $4.99 instead of updating the paid version? I’m going to give it a shot regardless because I also use your Ethermine app (I think that’s you too? If it is, there’s a typo in it) and it has saved my ass so many times when my rig turned off or had an issue and the only reason I found out was because of the app.  

Edit: downloaded and using the app now, the estimated income button highlighter is very jarring with night mode on. The text is almost the same color as the highlight to let you know which button you’ve selected.",,,,,,
1195,"Great question and happy to answer. Before that, yes, Ethermine Mining Monitor is also made by me, typo should be fixed in the new update.

I made Blockwatch X because a lot of miners have asked for a free version of the app.   
The reasons for creating a separate app are the following:

\- the free version implements ads to help fund future development  
\- if I made the original app free and with ads, it wouldn't have been fair to the original customers  
\- since the original Blockwatch is encapsulated only on the device, there's no mechanism to verify who bought the app, not a simple one anyway  
\- having a separate app allows for testing ideas on a larger scale that can be implemented in the main app  


Thanks for the bug report, will get it fixed in the next update.",,,,,,
1196,What happens when the local PUD assumes you into an evolving industries rate and increases your power rate by 200%?,,,,,,
1197,"I think you'll get a lot of questions from this sub but I'll start with a few... I'm not sure I understand the 5% profit charge.  If the client is solo mining do you expect them to report their profits?  How is cooling managed?  Is it open air cooling or refrigerant-based?  Is there a guaranteed intake temperature?  How is power delivered?  120/240, single phase, 3 phase?  How are remote resets handled?  Customer provided power relays?",,,,,,
1198,Nice clean facility. Price is too steep in current market and 5% is a total turn off,,,,,,
1199,What percentage of the rigs there are ASICS vs GPU'S?,,,,,,
1200,"We have a relationship with the PUD, as do many miners in our county. They just raised rates 3% for 2020 and we work with them and the public to solve power concerns. Any political concerns that arose during the last bubble have been addressed and the county is blockchain friendly. There is no “evolving industry rate.”",,,,,,
1201,"Thanks for your questions!

* I switch the miners to mine for the company 72 minutes/day. It’s automatic. I never hold your funds; it’s always mining direct.

* Open air cooling, we pull in outside air. Pretty standard for farms out here.

* Power is 208 volt 3 phase. 

* I handle remote resets. We have 50 amp pro switched PDU’s that are internet enabled.

* I provide power relays.",,,,,,
1202,Appreciate your feedback. Our prices move down with bulk!,,,,,,

It is gpu oriented CN coin that has unique POW called cryptonight-gpu
feel free to give a try to both amd and nvidia cards there ;) 
I like their algo and approach in making stuff that will work well on both gpu brands",,,,,,
1208,AIOMINER for sure,,,,,,
1209,"AIOMiner, but im biased",,,,,,
1210,I like equipool but do your homework as many can be a little scammy.,,,,,,
1211,"Treat this as a hobby, currently Trex mining RVN at minermore",,,,,,
1212,Been using MPH for almost two years and have been pretty happy with it. A little hard to track data though.,,,,,,
1213,"Best mining software is whatever is the best miner for your hardware that is supported by your OS, Best pool depends on the coin you are mining. These are not simple questions with simple answers, these answers change on a daily to weekly basis.

For Mining on Nicehash I prefer the latest build of the AngelBBS ""Nicehash Miner Legacy Fork Fix"" as it has all the algo's supported by Nicehash but with the best miners for every algo. For MPH and others you will need other multicoin miners, not a Fan of Awesome Miner, had trouble properly configuring that with MPH back when I tried to do that.",,,,,,
1214,Whatever works best for you. I like miningpoolhub and srb miner for my vega rigs.,,,,,,
1215,"That’s what the sales rep suggested , so not to do hyperthreading then?

And thanks by the way for the answers!",,,,,,
1216,AwesomeMiner MiningPoolHub,,,,,,
1217,I use https://miningpoolhubstats.com and it's OK.  At least there are graphs and such.,,,,,,
1218,"Let’s say hypothetically it was on a cloud provider like AWS, google or ibm . I know conventional wisdom that it wouldn’t be profitable because of the cost. But let’s say for argument sake that have few grand a month in credits. What would be considered optimal os and mining software?",,,,,,
1219,"Yeah same. It’s pretty good, though every now and again some data doesn’t come through. Not sure if you’ve noticed that as well",,,,,,
1220,"not sure what the source of the hashrate has anything to do with where is the best place to put the hashrate, also pretty sure AWS considers mining a violation of the TOS and you forfeit your credits when you get caught.",,,,,,
1221,"Definitely.  I think sometimes you need to wait for a share to be found.  For instance, mining X16rv2 currently and there was a while there where workers were showing in MiningPoolHub but no data in the apps, stats page... maybe an hour or more delay.  Awesome Miner still says $0/day but I am getting paid so ¯\ _ (ツ)_/¯",,,,,,
1222,yeah sounds to me whatever he's trying to do is questionably legal. lot of bots out there scrape API keys from github then spin up a zillion instances on someone else's dime,,,,,,
1223,"Actually I was given credits, so not really bots just 3 servers with each having 2 Nvidia Tesla 32gb v100, 96gb ram, Intel Xeon gold 6140 (36 cores 2.3 ghz) on Windows server 2019

Any recommended miner software or pool for that type of specs? And any advice to optimize it?",,,,,,

1225,"well first I'd wait to start until end of November so you can utilize both the GPUs (for whatever is hot) and CPUs (for monero)

basically you just go to whattomine.com and plug in your cards and then mine whatever algo it says is profitable for you. since they don't even have specs on v100's maybe plug in 2080tis. pick a pool that has a decent population but maybe not the most popular one. No reason to undervolt since you aren't paying for electricity. Also idk if you can play around with the core/mem clocks on AWS gpus. But like others have said, be careful you're not violating ToS with cryptomining.",,,,,,
1226,Cloud computing will still turn it off when they realize what you’re doing.,,,,,,
1227,"I’m using ibm so not by the hour. Plus not against tos. They flat out helped me customized specs for hashing purpose. I didn’t finalize since I wanted to make sure if this is the right fit. I was told to hyperthread to optimize hash rate

So I can use 2 mining softwares then? One for gpu and one for cpu (Monero)?

You think I should use multipoolminer or it might under utilize the gpu?",,,,,,
1228,"I use gminer which has an ok fee. It's been working pretty well for cuda reliant Algos. I haven't tried other miner software.  

I'm also making an assumption that you should be able to dual mine a CPU algo and a GPU algo

I'm interested in what specs they customized for mining purposes. Also, unless they specifically had the upcoming Monero algo switch in mind idk why they would have been suggesting hyperthreading since that's CPU side and currently 99% of profitable coins are GPU based",,,,,,
