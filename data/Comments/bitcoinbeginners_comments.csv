2,"TLDR margin means you borrow money to trade, you can win more but also and most often when done by newbies, loose more.

Futures is kinda betting whether it goes up or down in the future."
3,"A nice short answer, thanks! Two follow-up questions if you don't mind

1. What does the ""x3 margin"" mean? Does it show that you can borrow 3 times the amount you have? 
2. Where can i see when my money will get liquidated if i would use margin and borrow money to trade with"
4,"Yes 3x means  3 times of your asset value.
Eg. If you have 100 usd you take 3x margin in usd and buy all the btc of that amount. 
If your btc increase 10% your profit will be 30 usd.
You can calculate the liquidation price using following formula.

Liquidation price in % = 1/x 
where x is your margin rate.
so if you take 3x margin it will be 1/3= 33.33 
Now if  price goes down to 33 % your asset will be liquidated."

8,"The core client with a full node is probably “the best” but not appropriate for a new person... Just search for the top 2 hardware wallets and use one of those.

Also don’t invest more than you can lose. Also there’s a good reason why Bitcoin is valued higher than alts don’t be seduced if you see you can buy 50,000 Tittycoin for $20."
9,"Closed-source wallets are far inferior to any open-sourced ones. There's no transparency about how the wallet works so you have no idea how secure your money is. Also, altcoins and shitcoins boooo"
10,"Do the math on how much it will cost. 

And then remember that people can choose to route around you and make your chain insignificant"
11,"The expense would far exceed the value of the Bitcoin stolen. Someone would have to hate Bitcoin so much that they would be willing to spend trillions to bring it down. That's not *impossible* but it seems extraordinarily unlikely that an actor with trillions in disposable cash would rank ""destroy Bitcoin"" as the most valuable use for that cash when they could use it, instead, to buy up all Bitcoin in existence and still have trillions left over to buy oil or stocks or other valuable assets."
12,The only thing you can do if you have a huge amount of power is refuse to confirm transactions and possibly double spend. You can't push invalid transactions and take people's money
13,I’m going to guess you don’t have the money to buy billions of manches. And billions of machines do not exist.
14,"Nothing. This is a thing, and it's called a 51% attack."
15,First of all you would never get that much money with that much of a wasting mentality.
16,"Nothing... For the bargin price of 133 trillion USD, you could literally buy all the bitcoin.  Price would rise as you gobbled it up, but you could likely buy most of it.

You could probably buy out all the mining companies if you spread out a similar amount of money.

So yes... If you got hundreds of trillions of dollars, you could kill bitcoin."
17,that's just a matter of comparing to how much I would gain from having all the BTC.... if it's $100K or $1M per bitcoin... I think I can convince some investors to do this
18,that just means it's a matter of money... if bitcoin went to 100K or 1M ... the numbers in the equation would be different
19,"I don't have the money, but assuming I do is the main crux of the question.

Also, billions of machines DO exist.. I can create millions of containers on google for a few dollars a day each.

big companies launch thousands of containers a day... I'm sure we can add them all up to be billions shortly"
20,"Remember Bitcoin is not just about the machines - it needs a community of people who agree on what bitcoin is and participate in transactions. If you lose people to transact with, you can't call it a currency. 

Like imagine you're playing basketball and it's your ball, and you say ""OK guys, I score points whenever I hit the backboard, but you guys still have to put it through the net, OK? This is my ball so what I say goes.""  Everybody will just go to another place and play something without you and you're left on the court with a ball and no one to play with.

Also, in the case of Bitcoin you spent 50 billion on buying the ball.

Aside from all that, buying the machines doesn't give you access to people's bitcoins. You could just stop transactions from going through."
21,meaning in USD
22,"Yes, if the price of Bitcoin falls far enough, most of the miners would be forced to shut down and the difficulty target would get slashed and the real-world cost of a 51% would fall, proportionally. But that doesn't change what I explained above -- the cost of a 51% attack will still be many times higher than the value of the Bitcoins being heisted... since, remember, in the case where Bitcoin prices have fallen, so has the value of the bounty from a 51% attack.

In the other direction, if the price of Bitcoin increases a lot, then so will the hashrate (to meet the difficulty target) and that much more mining equipment is required to mount a 51% attack.

The price of Bitcoin is a free variable vis-a-vis a 51% attack. It doesn't matter what the price of Bitcoin is, the cost of a 51% attack is in relatively fixed proportion to the value of the bounty of the attack. Not only this, but a successful 51% attack would cause a complete collapse in the value of Bitcoin (to $0) and the mining equipment would afterwards have no capital value... so it's really a scorched-earth attack. You could use the same cash to just buy a bunch of mining rigs and earn cash from them without losing their capital value. Sell them off later, and you're richer by the amount of Bitcoin you earned while mining, without losing any capital."
23,"If you are talking about overtaking the mining for Bitcoin, then the machines don't exist. They are now specialised hardware (ASICs) and you would need to obtain more than are owned by the current miners on the network."
24,"This is the best argument I've seen yet. 

However, what happens if most of the people (because they are secretly me in disguise) I'm playing with agree with me?"
25,"It's all in the game theory. If your doing that then it's worth 0 and there's obviously no market for it if no one else has it. Bitcoin is nothing but a distributed database essentially that is secured by the users running nodes and miners mining. It would be pretty suspect if every single node and miner was spun up on amazons cloud platform and anyone with any serious money to put in would actually look at the health of the network itself.

You can essentially do what you said above by just forking btc and mine your own crypto. Doesnt mean that it's worth thousands. The value isn't really the tech, it's the adoption, security, immutability, decentralization, trustlessness and the fact that bitcoin isn't easy co-opt."

41,"The value relating to fiat only exists if you value fiat in the first place. 
A free market in currency means that if what you’re describing happens to one currency, people can switch to another without being forced to use the one that’s being manipulated.
Cryptocurrency is for everyone because nobody controls cryptocurrency, at most some people could try and control the majority of one, but it only retains functional value if others also still use it, incentivising them to avoid manipulation.
Fiat currency is entirely controlled, all of the time and when it gets manipulated it’s a case of ‘fuck you, you still have to use it’.
Bitcoin is just one currency. It’s also worth noting that no matter how much some people control some of it, they cannot create more of it beyond what it already allows for and therefore cannot devalue your holdings relative to the global supply of the coin itself."
42,">are a select few who control the value of Bitcoin, 

Value isn't just price , and if a billionaire buys up some BTC you benefit from added appreciation and more security. Also keep in mind that running a full node empowers you to veto any decision others make whether they are a  large investor or a miner. 

Here is a breakdown of the power dynamics in bitcoin when it comes to the rules of the protocol.

Ultimately economic users hold the most value and determine the immediate outcome in a Hard fork split. 

**Miners** have invested a lot in infrastructure , but have tight margins and typically have electrical and rental contracts where they cannot afford to mine coins that are unprofitable for long due to the community rejecting it. 

**exchanges** Have a lot of influence upon the naming of tokens or at least their ticker and act as somewhat of a large investor. This is another reason among many that we advise you to store your BTC yourself because we want users to be in control and not large centralized exchanges. They can also help predict an outcome of a split with future trading pairs. 


**Merchants and payment processors** give legitimacy to a chain , increase its network effect and influence more users to use that chain in the long term

**Developers, specialists and Oracles**  They cannot force code upon the users and since nodes don't self update economic users can reject their proposals with as little as inaction. These people indirectly influence economic users indirectly because the whole ecosystem depends upon them for security fixes and updates. Many developers are extremely large stakeholders due to being involved in Bitcoin since 2010 and 2011. 

**economic Users** have the most control. Ones that validate the rules with a full node cannot be coerced into new rules even with 100% of hashpower deciding upon something. Since miners have such high overhead they will typically quickly follow the lead of these users because they buy their product and it is quite costly to ignore their wishes. 

Not all economic users are equal however and there are different types of economic users. 

1) **Spenders** tend to use bitcoin for its utility and buy it just to spend instead of long term investment. These cannot influence HF split outcomes much because they typically do not have many BTC at any given time thus aren't awarded many BTC split tokens to wield their influence with

2) **Hodlers / Investors** These individuals have a great power and there are approximately ~70 large whales in our ecosystem who have between 10,000 and 100k BTC . Since they are given both sides of the coin in HF they can quickly determine the outcome in a speculation war . These people tend to be conservative IMHO with scaling as they have greatly profited from the years of stability and have a lot to risk by any proposal that damages bitcoins key characteristics or security. With every passing year the amount of large whales will drop and BTC will become more evenly distributed.

In reality we want bitcoiners to be both spenders and investors and there is a spectrum in the two above with how much one fits in each category"
43,"You may misunderstand freedom in general. Free speech might be be more able to be used by some, but the right is for everyone. Bitcoin is open to anyone. The price relative to fiat is a fact of the free market, not decisions of a central bank."
44,I couldn’t agree more. It’s definitely being controlled by whales. Finite number of coins and big wallets control the swings. People really think it just happens to take a dive at the end of each year then jump back up? Lol yea that’s manipulation
45,Dont confuse value with price.
46,"Put it this way, Bitcoin is open for everyone, everyone has a chance to get a piece of it. But how large the portion of it you are going to possess, it is up to you, trading is a democracy. Don't equate them two. 

With every passing year, the number of large whales will decline since whales also have to sell at a certain rate (even high), but hey, it is an open market, there is a demand, there is a supply. BTC will become more evenly distributed over time."
47,"> the same big players

Three cheers for mindless paranoia"
48,"No, you're 100% right. The problem is people who are whales were the ones who bought into Bitcoin when it wasn't worth anything, so they ultimately had the headstart. The problem of centralization of Bitcoin is not only in the vast amounts of BTC that whales own, but also in how mining has become centralized. A system is naturally going to become centralized if there is a way to profit from it."
49,"Already lots of good thoughts being shared. IMO the benefit Bitcoin has is the known scarcity. Whales can use their money to buy islands or move the market, but when the bitcoins are gone they are gone. Any new bitcoin have to be earned.

“It doesn’t matter if someone has a lot of toys, as long as you can’t take away my toys”.

Fiat money can be printed which hurts the little guy with a savings account, and unfairly benefits the entities who get that freshly printed money."

52,"1. Bitcoin is not a get rich scheme. 

2. You cant avoid people doing whatever they want (trading) and pricing it. Price is not an intrinsic property of btc.

3. Only social consensus can modify bitcoin intrinsic properties. No elite can control them."
53,do you have any evidence for your claim that it's manipulated by the ultra wealthy?
54,"Unless you're mining, you have no choice but to attach a fiat value to crypto. The average Bitcoin holder does not mine. I doubt even 1% of Bitcoin holders mine. So we have no choice but to attach a fiat value to it. 

Further, Bitcoin is being controlled (relative to fiat value). Whales are constantly pumping and dumping, accumulating more and more wealth. They're not called Whales for nothing - they move the cryptomarket just like the Buffets of fiat. This is my frustration. They may not be able to create any but they'll accumulate all they can, just like any hedge fund will with fiat."
55,"> control the swings.

The biggest problem here is for those that day trade where whales have an advantage.**Don't Daytrade.** These swings don't effect my bitcoin investment. If a whale buys BTC I benefit from appreciation , If they sell and dump the market my buy limit order auto picks up discounted BTC and I benefit.

I care about using BTC securely and accumulating more at the same time. Hopefully more people will realize that day trading is not wise and think longer  term"

58,">Whales are constantly pumping and dumping, accumulating more and more wealth.

This is a concern that extends with any wealthy person whether trading forex currencies, trading gold on exchanges, stocks, investing in land, or Bitcoin. Those that have large sums of money have certain advantageous over investors or traders who lack resources and one of many reasons you should avoid day trading.

59,"I do have a choice, I don’t have to attach a value to fiat whatsoever, since to me, fiat is worthless. I can’t speak from the perspective of anyone who isn’t an anarcho-capitalist however.

If you feel that the currency is being manipulated too much, get rid of it. Switch to one that meets your requirements. It’s important to remember that as much as they might accumulate, there still needs to be a use for it to have any value to them in the first place and if they accumulate enough of it, it’ll become functionally useless and everyone will move elsewhere, rendering their hoard effectively worthless.

The key advantages are that nobody can just print more out of nowhere, your percentage of the overall supply will not go up or down and you can move between currencies to avoid manipulation. Plus of course nobody can freeze your crypto wallet, nobody can fine it automatically, nobody can tax it, plenty of advantages, None of those are possible with fiat.

If stability is what you’re looking for, come back in 50 years when the tech is more mature, in the meantime I’d suggest trying gold or something else!"
60,They cant accumulate my bitcoins. Bitcoins go from weak hands to strong ones. I love that.
61,"Day-trading whales don't control the trend, nobody does."
62,"OP here. I don't understand why someone might view this post as suspicious. I'm a little surprised by the upvotes too, but I certainly didn't buy any!

Also, in response to the comment above you. How is this off-topic? I genuinely wanted a discussion and I've gotten a lot of great, informative response."
63,"Fiat may be worthless to you (have no worth), but certainly isn’t valueless (no value). You’ve got intrinsic value in fiat - the fact that you can trade what is worthless to you for something that is valuable, makes fiat have value. If you didn’t value fiat, you wouldn’t accept it at all, since there would be nothing you could do with it, or you’d freely give it out and expect nothing (or little) in return. But because you can exchange it for goods of value, its intrinsically valuable to you. How much value (as a percentage of the “market exchange rate”) is up to you. Would you pay $2 for a $1 cheese burger? Some might, but others who value fiat higher wouldn’t. You’d be hard pressed to find someone willing to pay $1 million for a $1 burger because of how little they valued fiat.

All that means that bitcoin does have a fiat value attached to it, and you can’t escape that.

Otherwise, I agree with what you’ve said. They’re good points (minus the “nobody can fine it”/“nobody can tax it”, since you don’t fine/tax currency, you fine/tax entities)."
64,This is almost as stupid calling yourself an anarcho-capitalist. If fiat is worthless could I have yours? No point in talking big if your arguments are disconnected from reality.
65,"> I don't understand why someone might view this post as suspicious

66,"Value is an individual subjective measurement. You trade what you have for something else because you value that something else more than what you originally had. In this case, my personal value of non-fiat currency relative to fiat is far higher than the rate of exchange. I do my best not to hold onto fiat for any longer than I have to and quickly shift it to people who do value it for things that I personally value.

That fiat value to you and the fiat exchange rate on a market are two different things.

Nobody can sieze and fine or tax your address on a blockchain when compared to traditional banking in which the state can freeze and sieze your assets."
67,"I don’t have any and I do my best to avoid holding onto it for any longer than needed. Luckily, other people do still value it, so I can usually get stuff that is worth something for it pretty quickly.
If you value it, good for you, I’m not going to be a dick to you just because I disagree."
68,"I've got one other account that I post on sport subreddits. Who has time for 50+ puppet accounts?! I don't care if this gets 100 or 0 upvotes - why would I? Or anyone for that matter.

As a novice in Bitcoin, I was genuinely curious about this topic. And obviously I'm not the only beginner or novice with the same feelings if people are upvoting it."
69,"You are correct.

I will agree that funds can be frozen/seized, but you said taxed/fined. Neither of those apply to fiat. Your funds can be seized for not paying fines, but fines themselves are levied upon the users. You can still be taxed (and will be if it continues to grow & replace currencies) with bitcoin. You can voluntarily pay that tax, since there’s no way to force that like traditional fiat, but it’s hard to use your BTC if you’ve been put in jail for failure to pay taxes..."
70,"I'm being a dick because you are talking out of your ass just to sound cool. If you can trade fiat for everything you should see a value in it. If you see no value in it, give it away. Why not give away something that's worthless to you if it can help someone else? Do you want a list of charities?"
71,"You are fine, not every post needs to be positive about Bitcoin and its fine to address any questions you have. The concern here from others is this post is at minimum clearly being brigaded (67+ upvotes which is a really unusual amount) and buttcoiners, altcoiners and nocoiners love to concern troll and spread misinformation which is counterproductive.  Thus you can see other peoples concerns here, but I hope we answered your questions. Cheers"
72,"Sure, I'm not arguing that, I'm just clarifying what I meant in my original statement, now that I'm not a few beers into my evening as I was when I wrote my first two comments, I'm not sure where you're from, but in a lot of places, taxation happens before the average person ever receives any fiat in the first place! I'm under the impression that this is different in the US though, I'm guessing that is all done manually by the individual at some point?

You can only be taxed on crypto if the address can be linked to an individual, I'd also argue that a voluntary tax is an oxymoron, a 'voluntary tax' is just a donation, taxation is coercively extracting funds via threat of force, but that's a philosophical and ethical question separate from the point anyway. If the state required donation and could no longer track everyone's finances to do what they currently are, I'd be a lot happier overall! 

The point was simply that no outside force can take control of your crypto without you having to act to allow them to do so, which is worlds apart from fiat! It puts a lot of the economic power into the hands of each individual instead of a small centralised group that control the supply of currency!

I hope that somewhat clears up what my thoughts are a bit better, I'm sorry I didn't word things too well in my earlier comments!"
73,"No, I'm talking from my personal principles, you're just being a dick because you don't share them.
I don't believe that the state is a valid institution or that it has any actual authority over anyone, but they're still going to point guns at people to create the same effect as if they did. 
I only interact with fiat at all because I have to, there is no option to opt out of the fiat system currently. I get given fiat and immediately trade it away to people who do see value in it so that I can get things that actually hold value to me. My own shit has no value to me either, but if someone offered me a few grams of gold for it, you can bet that I'm going to bag my shit up and make that trade any day.
I donate to charity already thankyou, I don't need any help figuring out how to do that.
You don't have to share my perspective and I understand completely if you disagree, that's no reason to be an arsehole and that's not going to convince anyone who doesn't already share your view."
74,"That’s fair. US taxation is done in a couple ways: 1) employers report & pay on employees’ behalf 2) use/consumption/sales tax is collected at time of purchase of a good/service 3) additional institutions/banks report earnings of investments (stocks/bonds/interest/etc 4) manual adjustments are made by the person to finalize the details for the previous year.

A person could report different things and either owes or (in the cast of the majority of Americans) is owed some amount of money. Discrepancies cause flags, more flags has a higher chance of audit, plus a random smattering of audits happen throughout the year.

Addresses don’t need to be linked to individuals because the individual is taxed directly. It doesn’t matter how many wallets you have or where, if you earned 1 BTC in income, you pay 0.1 BTC in taxes. If that’s in a single wallet or 10 wallets, it doesn’t matter, you, as an individual, still owe 0.1. Wanna claim you lost them all? You’ll have to file a police report, your wages will be garnished (by forcing businesses to pay the government before you), and if all else fails, you’ll wind up in prison. If it’s *ever* discovered that you still had access to those coins in the future, you’re busted on years of fraudulent history (false taxes, false police reports, etc).

I agree on the “voluntary tax”. My use of “voluntary” was to echo the nonsense of people here to say “lost mine in a boating accident”. It’s tax evasion, illegal and ill advised. But, as you said, with crypto, you can’t be forced to surrender your crypto, just your person (and other assets).

No worries on wording, just don’t want to continue to spread the “use bitcoin to evade taxes” BS that people spout off. If crypto makes existing taxation difficult, you can be guaranteed that taxation methods are changed. The government is gonna get its money one way or another."
75,"What you're saying is basically ""Fiat holds no value except it does"". You don't want fiat to be money but it is. You don't want fiat to hold value but it does. I don't agree with the monarchy in my country but that doesn't take to power away from the king. Reality is not for you to decide."
76,"No, I’m telling you that an average market price and value are different things. value is subjective and based on the individual. You would never buy or sell anything in your life if you didn’t value something over another.
If you value what I have more than what you have and vice versa, then we will both trade and in turn we both gain value from each other.
If you value the fiat in your wallet more than a pizza, you wouldn’t buy a pizza. If you value the pizza more, you’ll trade the fiat for the pizza. At the same time, the person selling the pizza will value the fiat higher than the pizza or they wouldn’t sell it in the first place.
You can then take all of those trades and determine the average market price for something, but that’s all it is, an average market price.
This is the foundational basis for free market capitalism and unless you’re about to try and argue that trade is somehow a zero sum game, I really don’t see where you’re trying to go with this."

84,"so you mean,  generating several public keys until I find one that satisfy some condition I impose? I think it's much easier to just hash the seed like Kallin101 suggested"
85,"yes, I was thinking about doing a SHA1 of the `hdseedid` (obtained via `getaddressinfo`), it's easy but a bit random...
I think hashing the seed directly will scare a bit other developers as they probably are afraid to touch it and mess up"

I'll never use a custodial lightning wallet (beyond testing) but I think this is fine advice for new users and nothing to be shunned because lightning is more complicated and keeping a small amt of spending cash in a custodial wallet is fine as long as one controls the keys to their primary savings separately 

blue wallet or wallet of satoshi are fine examples that make using lightning easy especially with receiving lightning txs"

A software wallet, like Exodus maybe worth looking into - even if you dont use it to hold your coins, just download and familiarize yourself with it.

Software wallets can be custodial / non-custodial.  Essentially, if they dont force you to write the 12/24 word seed and then run a check, they are just one step removed from leaving it on the exchange."
101,"I can not recommended Exodus. Very nice UX UI but many attack vectors. Not open-source. You can not set the fees and therefore overpay every time. Segwit address for low fees are not used by default. 

Use Bitcoin core, electrum or wasabi."
102,"Not really a beginner question  
The simplest way would be to write your own. Start with the `testmempoolaccept` code, remove the parts which are not relevant to signature checking, compile, test"
103,"One issue is that signing transactions potentially requires the UTXO set, or for the caller to feed the UTXOs being spent. You'd also have to tell it what consensus/policy rules to enforce, as things can be changed based on block height etc."

108,"For future reference maybe do a small test transaction first before doing a large one just to make sure they have paper.

Bitcoin ATM near me gives me a choice of scanning wallet address off of my phone or having printed paper wallet. After the first transaction I believe they can look you up just by phone number.

Look to see if there is an email address associated with the machine.

You can find the info to most ATMs here.

109,"I dont think you can. If you want the funds back or the ticket, youll need to verify it was you who owns it. I think, going by exchanges security, you may need alot of information about the transaction and your account (possibly your wallet address). Im not sure how those machines work, ive yet to see one in the UK but i would presume the security measures would be strict. could depend on your wallet also, I know for a fact Coinbase are extremely hard to pass security checks if something goes rong with your account or a transaction. Good luck bud, I hope you get everything sorted out. 

I wonder if youll get the price when you bought the ticket or will it not have locked in, you could do better if the market goes down or vice versa lol, I would make sure to make that point when speaking to someone."
110,"Thanks for your input, I really appreciate it. I'm just concerned because it was anonymous because of the ticket instead of sending it to a wallet so proving that it was actually me might be difficult, I reckon since I'm in London the store has security cameras though, plus my ATM withdrawal moments before further proves it was in fact me."
111,Thanks for going out of your way to find their contact info for me! I'm just concerned about anonymity when I contact them. That's why I wanted a paper ticket in the first place.
112,there should be video footage on the ATM

The store rents the floor space to the ATM operator  
The ATM probably has a face camera, unless it's one of those compact Lamassu models. I presume it sends images to the ATM operator

You have to contact the ATM operator. Their processes are their own  
In future, use your own wallet on your phone, scan your own QR code. This is anonymous, without the risk of a printer failure"
114,"Its not a big deal. If privacy is a large concern than 

1) Send the recovered coins to a different wallet you never made tx from in the  past 

2) Either coinjoin the BTC with joinmarket or samourai or wasabi or spend the BTC on something else where privacy is not a concern and dont ever mix tx between wallet A with wallet B


Doing this , you are just some guy who once bought BTC with their ATM even if you have to show them ID , they cannot link past txs easily with future txs"
115,Well I guess if they ask for details you're gonna have to decide if your anonymity is worth £150 or not. But you should defo bollock them for allowing the machine to operate when it doesn't have paper lol
116,Will I have to give them my name or ID or anything though?
117,You're right. Thanks for the tips and the peace of mind. Bitcoin tumbling is a slippery slope but I might look into that because of what happened; makes things truly untraceable. What are your thoughts on that?
118,Im not positive but the footage should be there. Ive not seen a BTC ATM that didnt have a camera on it.
119,"Dont use a centralized tumbler but a wallet like wasabi , samourai , or joinmarket to coinjoin the coins ....

122,"GBTC is a reasonable way to track the price of Bitcoin, especially if you have a tax-sheltered account such as a 401k or IRA. I also recommend it to newbies, who have trepidations about bitcoin.

You can find the # of bitcoins/share at greyscale's [web page](https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/) (Currently 0.00097091)

Then, the premium is:    ($GBTC - $btc x .00097)/($btc x .00097)

(I think that math is correct. The premium is about 25% right now)

 There was a website that calculated it for you [here](https://crypto.neotechdevs.com/). But, it stopped updating a few weeks ago... 

Owning your own coins is always better, but a lot of people have money locked in their retirement accounts. GBTC is a good way to gain Bitcoin price exposure in that case.

Good luck!"

125,"No reason for retail investors to be buying GBTC. 100% purchase and store your own Bitcoin. Even if you're afraid of managing your own private keys, buying on Coinbase and just keeping it in your wallet is a superior option to GBTC."
126,"There is no best wallet. There are different wallets with different strengths and tradeoffs and many people use multiple wallets . You want an open source wallet that is popular  with a lot of support. Here are the ones that are recommended for beginners  -

**Best wallets for securing small amounts of BTC**

**electrum** For Desktop and Android

Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control 

Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets, make sure you only upgrade from official sources like play store or https://electrum.org as malicious servers or adverts can tell you to upgrade malware from other sites

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4EhZg5QslI

**Éclair** LN wallet for Android and desktop

Pros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees

Cons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental ,Some users may want to use other LN wallets. http://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq4lF2s4UtI

**hodlwallet** IOS and android wallet

Pros- Much better UX than other wallets and slick look as it’s a fork of the original Bread wallet

Cons- lacks some privacy features found in electrum 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_KDf5WYfzQ

**Blockstream Green Wallet** IOS and android wallet

Pros- Great UX, easy hardware wallet and full node integration, RBF, HW wallet support and advanced 2fa options
Cons- Until single signature is released 2 of 2 multisig means that one must depend upon blockstream’s server for tx signing. Other light wallets are dependent upon other servers as well but light wallets like electrum allow you to swap servers.

127,"""Best"" is subjective. It's like asking which car is the best. Here's a rough overview:

Software wallets. Bitcoin Core is the best in terms of security. It's the most reviewed piece of software, verifies the blockchain, etc. Then there's Wasabi Wallet which is a bit more advanced, but helps your privacy like no other wallet. But... Neither of them works on mobile, so in terms of mobility you'll want something like Samourai Wallet or Green Wallet. If you want LN there's Breez. Mobile wallets typically sacrifice a little bit of security and privacy though.

Hardware wallets. There's Coldcard, Trezor and Ledger. All are good, there are slight differences in how they handle security, but overall you'll be fine with any of them.

So there's plenty of great wallets out there, it really depends on your needs. If you just want to hodl get a hardware wallet. If you want to transact in bitcoin start small with any reputable software wallet, get comfortable with it, and then see if there's something better for your needs."

As long as you are not giving him your private key it's all good. He needs your private key to spend your Bitcoin.

It's like you giving him your open padlock. He writes a secret message and puts it in a little box. Secured with your, now closed padlock. Only you who has the private key can open the box. You read him his secret message and therefore you proof you own that private key without giving him your private key.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18qy88/bitcoin_message_signing_and_verification/"
154,"no but he may use it to pretend he's you and scam someone else. i suggest you include the date, your name as the owner of the coins and his name as the challenger in the message as well.

also you can only sign messages with p2pkh addresses i.e. those beginning with 1. if your wallet has other types of addresses then you can't sign messages with those."
155,"If it's a generic message like 

""hello 1 2 3 4""

You'd be fine.

 If it's a long string of computer code I would not do it until after moving the funds somewhere else.

You'd still be able to prove that you had ownership of that address that formerly had the funds.

If you're trying to claim hex I would move the funds to a different address before signing any messages. They are just verifying you had the funds during the snapshot. Moving funds to a new address is always the safest way to make a claim."
156,"The sign message protocol prepends this string: ""Bitcoin signed message:\n"" which is highly unlikely to be a valid transaction prefix. 

You're safe just be careful about privacy."
157,"> can him use the signature i generated and try hack my wallet? and stole my funds?

No, they can not.

That being said, signing messages does produce a ***very*** small danger.  It exposes your ***public*** keys.  Normally both your private and public keys are hidden until you actually spend the funds.  Exposing your public keys before you spend could be a problem in 50 years or so, but for now it should be fine.  Just be aware that it reduces your protection from a far-future QC attack."

You can do the math required to get a seed, addresses, etc, with a pen and paper if you really want to, that is perfectly valid too. (It will just take a long, long time)

The existence of this an address that was created with this offline wallet would only become apparent once someone sent funds to that address, so that it appeared on the public ledger. (Though this wouldn't reveal anything about the public keys, private keys, etc, that you used to get the address, no-one else can link the address to a wallet you made this way either)"
204,"> bitcoin wallets on websites

Mostly, not real wallets. If the Web site controls the Bitcoin keys, then it's their wallet, not yours. You only have an account on the Web site, not a wallet  

> you need public and private key

You need hundreds, maybe thousands of private keys, with one Bitcoin address per key. A Bitcoin address is a single-use token

> therefore it is not in the ledger

The ledger contains transactions  
Transactions contain inputs and outputs  
A transaction output is a coin  
A transaction input spends a coin from an older transaction  
A coin can only be spent once  
A coin can not be partially spent  

An output (coin) contains an address and an amount  
Addresses do not exist in the ledger as addresses, except in the context of being part of a transaction output  

> how does one create valid bitcoin wallet?

Create enough private keys for your predictable future use, and be able to create more when they've all been used once  

> Can one exhaust all wallet combinations

A private key is a very long integer - 256 bits long  
It is so long that it would take all the computers in the future history of the earth more time than the future history of the universe to accidentally find another person's key  
It would be easier to find a key in an old, discarded computer, or on paper in a dumpster than to attempt to compute all possible values"
205,">Can one exhaust all wallet combinations 

No. Watch this video to understand why - 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZloHVKk7DHk

>Also, how does cold wallet storage works? Only storing the private key and public key and thats it?

cold storage simply means your private keys are secured in such a way that they never contact directly with a network connected device. 

This means that Hardware wallet technically are not cold storage devices if you connect them to your internet connected laptop or phone but they are quasi  cold storage insomuch as the private keys never leave the device and all tx signing occurs in the hardware wallet.

The exception to this is  hardware wallets like cold card which  allow you true cold storage with PSBTs -

Otherwise cold storage is just a backup on paper or metal waiting to be imported or swept later on . In the past people used to copy down a private key and address on paper for cold storage but this is an obsolete way to secure your Bitcoin and never should be used. 

These days you should store 12 /18 / 24 words for cold storage or use a multisig or SSS(although multisig  is better) for these reasons -

212,"To say that an address is registered at some point risks misunderstanding how the derivation of private keys and public keys work. Basically it is more correct to say that all valid addresses (and their corresponding private and public keys) already exist before they are ever used. Basically once an address is used, you can prove who is the owner of it based on possessing the private key that was used to generate the address. (You don't need to have registered this anywhere, with anyone beforehand for them to be able to verify that you have the key)

It's a bit like if you consider the sum:  A + B \* C = D

You could say that all answers for D already exist based on valid possible selections of A, B and C where these are positive whole numbers less than say, 1,000,000. (It could be infinite, or anything, but lets just have some constraints on A, B and C to help imagine the protocol rules that Bitcoin imposes)

You are right in that the public ledger continues to grow, the Bitcoin blockchain is a few hundred GB right now and still grows. Mobile wallets (and any non-full node wallet) generally has a server that it ""trusts"" to be able to work out balances, etc, but it still does all the generation of keys, signing of transactions, etc, itself. (and invalid transactions will still be rejected by miners) You can also validate what a lite wallet like this wallet is telling you with a full node at home (or somewhere) that you trust to be telling the truth."
213,"> the ledger grows everyday

Yes, but most of the ledger is irrelevant history. Day-to-day use requires knowing just enough history to prove a coin exists and has not been spent already  


> how android apps work with less storage than the ledger need? A trusted service provider that calculates for you?

A network of servers operated by volunteers. Using them requires you to trust  
Alternatively, you can run your own servers and tell your Android wallet to only trust your own server"
214,"There are so many possible wallet addresses that there is no real chance of generating a key that is already in use, assuming you can generate good pseudo-random numbers.  

 There are approximately 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976 possible addresses.  If everyone on earth did nothing but generate thousands of new addresses every second you'd probably get to the heat death of the universe before one is repeated."

Yes, The private keys and transaction signing occur within the ledger so even if your computer  is compromised the private key generation and wallet use is secure as long as you verify the tx address on your HW screen 

> Also, same question for running Ledger Live.

This is fine to use or you can use  electrum for more features

>In other words, how to avoid being pwned right from the start.

Do not keep your HW wallet in the same location as your backup words
The HW wallet itself doesn't need to be hidden except if you are trying to limit the amount of people who know you have Bitcoin in the first place because it protected by a pin and or passphrase where wrong entries delay retries exponentially and/or reset the HW wallet after a while.
Thus the focus should be on securing the BIP39 backup words .

1) Do not store these digitally

2) Never write down the pin or passphrase together with the 12/18/24 words

3) At minimum secure the backup 12/18/24 words on paper in a sealed plastic bag to protect against moisture or flooding. Do not laminate as certain adhesives can damage the ink.

4) If you can afford , upgrade to a metal backup (steel , copper brass... but aluminum is unacceptable)

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test/

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test--part-ii-/

5) Keep backup private and secure , whoever gets a hold of this can steal your BTC!

6) Pin you will just store in memory as that is not needed to restore a backup, but if you use the advanced passphrase feature you will need to back this up in memory and best to backup written down as well (paper or metal) . Passphrase should be kept separate than your backup 12/18/24 words

232,"A Great Tool for Cryptocurrency Investors

Cryptocurrency investors are responsible for securing their own funds.

&#x200B;

And if you’re looking to secure cryptocurrency, the Ledger Nano S is one of the easiest and cheapest ways

You can use the Ledger Nano S to store ETH, ETC, Dash, Ripple, Stratis, ZCash, Litecoin, NEO, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash, Viacoin and a few other alt currencies (including BTC). You can see a complete list here.

Because it’s an HD wallet, you control many accounts for all supported cryptocurrencies. This means that all cryptos stored here will be secure with the same backup key. So let’s say you are storing Bitcoin for your friends or family, you can label those account for them and keep them safe as if they were your own.

Ledger supports all ERC tokens when used with MyEtherWallet. I have already tested this.

Ledger is compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS. It can also connect to your Android device using an OTG cable.

To receive Bitcoin, your Ledger Nano S doesn’t need to be connected to a computer. You can receive Bitcoin even if your Ledger is offline.

&#x200B;

Your Bitcoin private key is stored in a secured section of the device itself. It doesn’t ever leave the device, and hence, there’s no way for a hacker to get to it.

The Ledger Nano S is an HD wallet. This means that every time you receive funds, you get a new receiving address. This enhances your privacy to a great extent.

You can also sign a message using the Ledger Nano S to prove your ownership of the address. You may use this feature in the future when you advance in your Bitcoin and cryptocurrency usage.

There are more advantages of using Ledger Nano S that you will discover as you become more comfortable with the device."

>Is it possible to just upgrade my current Electrum or do I need to uninstall it and install a newer version of Electrum?


Simply installing the new version of electrum will upgrade it. Just make sure you always use a reputable source as malware exists. 

https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-do-i-upgrade-electrum

https://electrum.org/#download

**If malware exists at the time you sweep or import the keys on the computer than you run a risk of losing the BTC. This is why hardware wallets exist.(perhaps consider getting a HW wallet instead if this is too confusing for you.) It is safer than OSX/windows to install electrum on a clean android(no sketchy apps or rooted or sideloaded apps) or a clean version of TAILS/QUBES/Ubuntu.**

HW wallets - https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/e2hhxo/is_coinbase_good_place_to_start_in_usa_or_please/f8vsszz/

>We share the same IP, so will Electrum still allow me to create a new Electrum that will work independently of my now obsolete Electrum on my desktop PC?

The IP doesn't matter here. If you use the same 12 word seed it will simply be a mirror of the other one. Just make sure you keep the 12 word seed private and secure even if you don't store the BTC on the wallet. Realistically I would suggest not storing private keys and just secure the seed phrase and if you are concerned about malware on your PC you can delete electrum after you backup your seed thus-

Step 1 - install electrum on your PC as a new wallet , select native/bech32 segwit , and generate a new 12 word seed that you backup . Keep these 12 words private and secure and at minimum in plastic bag or insert to protect from water/moisture damage.

Step 2 - Sweep, don't import, the private keys into this wallet 

Step 3 (optional) - Once you backed up your words and sweeps the private keys you can verify the backup by installing electrum on your android and recovering from the 12 words 

Step 4 - delete the wallets from your device if you want cold storage only 

Step 5 (optional) - upgrade to a metal wallet backup 

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test/

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test--part-ii-/

Step 6 (optional) - create a watch only wallet so you can see your balance - https://bitcoinelectrum.com/creating-a-watch-only-wallet/"
239,"I recently upgraded Electrum on desktop  
The new version reads the same wallet folder and settings folder as the old version. This will not matter to you because your old wallet is empty, but in any case, the process is anxiety-free  

I endorse everything in the /u/bitusher comments"
240,"Just install the latest version by downloading it from [electrum.org](https://electrum.org). You don't have to uninstall the old version. Just install the new one on top of the old one.

Regarding your question about IP addresses and what electrum will and will not allow you to do you should know that electrum is software that runs on your PC. It is not a website or some remote account you log in to. It doesn't care what IP you have and you don't have to ask permission from anyone to use electrum."
241,"You can just download the update and install it, it will replace the old version.

You can verify that the download is authentic by following these instructions: https://youtu.be/lCG3c8a7HZI

If you don't have a balance stored in electrum, you could also use it with a hardware wallet like a Ledger or Trezor, as that way the funds are able to be stored and used in a more secure way while still using  Electrum. (If that is the interface you are familiar with)"
242,"This is actually *very* easy but there are some steps you **must** do:

1. Only download software from [electrum.org](https://electrum.org) that you typed into your browser yourself. Never trust any other source.
2. Access your current wallet and *write down the seed words* and *store them securely off your computer*. These words will allow you to recreate your wallet on *any* device so treat them like printed bitcoin. A safety deposit box or similar security is indicated if you have any significant amount of BTC. If you don't store any BTC in your current wallet you can just delete it and create a new one.
3. Please reconsider the safety of paper wallets - there are *many* ways to lose your BTC when using them. 

Once these are done, you can create a wallet on any PC / laptop (Apple or Windows) or Android phone. It is not important what device it is on (or its IP).  When you download the newest Electrum (see step 1), just choose ""I already have a seed phrase"" and your wallet should be restored on whatever device you are using.

There is a subReddit devoted to Electrum, it is (predictably) named r/electrum  Please post there if you run into any problems - there are many people there that will help."
243,"Thank you for the reply.  I think you helped me a few years back when I was just learning about Bitcoin.

I have no devices or smart phones, only my desktop computer and the hubby's laptop.  The electrum is on my desktop, and it is an out-of-date version that I would be afraid to use now.  

So if I install a new electrum wallet on the laptop, it will have no connection whatever to the electrum on the desktop computer? 

This should work for me and is probably the best solution.  I remember how I installed the current electrum, so I should be able to do this again, and write down the new seed words.  I don't know how to delete software, but I am going to need to hire a tech help guy to upgrade my desktop computer from windows 7 to windows 10 so I can just get him to uninstall the old electrum at the same time.

I know that paper wallets as well as windows are viewed unfavorably, but I need to stick with what I know because at this point in my life learning new things is confusing and trying to navigate the unfamiliar would likely prove more dangerous.  I'm comfortable with paper wallets and electrum.  I generated enough paper wallets several years ago to last me forever, and never had a problem sweeping them into my electrum. The fact is I'm unlikely to actually spend anymore of my btc during what remains of my lifetime, but I'd like to regain the ability to do so just in case.  More likely it will sit in cold storage until I decide to give it away rather than have it be lost when I go.

I appreciate your reply.  It has been a great help."
244,Thanks.  :-)

250,coinbase has a hold of usually 1 week for most banks with ACH transfers but can take longer if its your first transaction with them
251,There isn't a hold. Took me under a minute last time I did it (CB to private wallet)
252,"If you're trying to go from cash to private Bitcoin wallet in the least amount of time. Bitcoin ATM would be the fastest but most expensive fees.

Cash App lets you use your debit card and the fees are less expensive then coinbase and there is no wait. They also give you a free debit card you can Custom Design.

Crypto.com is another option and they also give you a free debit card.

Bittrex let's you do wire transfer but it's not cheap. I only recommend wire for anything over $2,500 otherwise it's just too expensive.

Coinbase is the slowest and last option I would choose. Everything you do on coinbase gets forwarded to the IRS right away. Coinbase used to be quick until they turned into a deep state surveillance agency."
253,"There is a hold - they hold dynamically based on many factors, they don't ""just send"" the coins. This should always be assumed when dealing with an administrator.

Coinbase sometimes don't send coins for up to 24 hours for apparently no reason, but normally instantly assuming your account is fully verified.

Also, they will tell you the hold time on purchases, depending on how you purchase."
254,"The delay is due primarily to delays in the U.S. banking system. It can take several days for the money to be transferred from your bank account to their bank account. Otherwise, U.S. regulations may also force them to ban you or freeze your bitcoins."
255,exchanges do btc withdrawals in batches so yes there will be a delay. i suggest you ask coinbase support for more details since you are paying them.
256,he's asking about btc withdrawals
257,With bitcoin to bitcoin from another user or wallet?
258,"You likely used a card and paid a higher fee- 3.99% instead of 1.49% with an ACH transfer

https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2109597-coinbase-pricing-fees-disclosures"
259,"There is a hold - they hold dynamically based on many factors, they don't ""just send"" the coins. This should always be assumed when dealing with an administrator."
260,"Im asking about if I have someone who wants bitcoin sent to their coinbase wallet for whatever reason, or if I send bitcoin to my coinbase wallet.

Do I have to wait to pull that bitcoin out to a private wallet again?"
261,"Maybe my post didnt explaim well enough lol. I am asking if I send bitcoin to my coinbase wallet or someone else does, can I transfer that bitcoin back off once it goes through or is there a hold the same way there is with cash?"
262,"Just an FYI on the specifics. Withdrawing with coinbase pro there is no delay , no fee,  and no batching , but they use native segwit to send from or change return to. 

Withdrawing from coinbase there is no delay either once the hold is lifted and they overcharge on a withdraw fee unlike with pro so one should never withdraw via coinbase , and instead tx the funds from coinbase to coinbase pro for free than withdraw

With cash app , the delay is a few seconds because they do a smart mini batch 5-20 UTXOs , there is no fee, and they send from native segwit addresses"
263,"Yes, when you buy Bitcoin on coinbase they have at least a 1 week hold on your BTC withdrawals , specifically due to the nature of the ACH needing to clear(If you buy with a debit card you won't necessarily have this BTC hold). Lately they have started even allowing you to gradually withdraw small amounts of BTC that are on hold in increments as well

Thus with regular coinbase a client can expect a 1 week BTC hold when you buy with bank transfers , and 2 weeks or more with their initial purchase 

With coinbase pro there is no hold but it also takes around a week for the fiat to deposit from a bank transfer unless they do a wire so the net effect is similar 

The BTC hold also prevents you from sending the BTC from coinbase to coinbase pro until it is released as well.

Cash App doesn't have these long holds."
264,"So I bought btc on CB and waited till I got the email saying my funds are now accessible that action took a couple of days. 
Once I got that I sent the btc to my private wallet and that action took less than a minute. It was also the same with eth & xrp actually those transactions from CB to wallet were even faster"
265,from CB to private wallet there isn't a hold from bank account to CB there is a hold.
266,It takes like an hour for it to deposit. And you might have to wait two hours to pull it out. Coinbase is the slowest.
267,"There is normally no hold once your account has been credited, but Coinbase can choose to freeze your bitcoins for any reason (for example, they don't like who sent them to you or they don't like who you are sending to)."
268,The hold is what I am talking about. Thanks
269,"Im talking about bitcoin to bitcoin transfers, not fiat to bitcoin"
270,"Still not true. From coinbase to private wallet there is a dynamic hold. While some will receive within 30 seconds, others will wait 24 hours. Some, depending on analytics or verification results will lose their coins altogether.

Simply - don't use coinbase as a wallet, ever.

Consider the original question. It's possible that it was asked because OP was asked to withdraw from coinbase for someone - or that they MUST use a coinbase wallet to receive. Or they want to use coinbase as a mixer (receive back different coins than sent in). All of the above would likely cost OP because coinbase DOES filter and apply holds on withdrawal."
271,"Bitcoin is so secure it only requires 3 confirmations for a deposit , not 6 

https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/593836-why-is-my-transaction-pending-

The Poisson process means that this could mean less than a minute to over an hour but typically ~30 minutes


I never have any delays in withdrawing from coinbase pro(you should never withdraw from regular coinbase regardless because they overcharge on a tx fee and pro pays that for you so its nonsensical to not use pro."
272,"The hold of BTC is related to the Fiat purchase. 

If you are not purchasing BTC than these are the holds: 

Depositing BTC into coinbase requires 3 confirmations before sending it or selling it from coinbase. 

Withdrawing or spending BTC from coinbase to private wallet/merchant is instant and confirmations come as normal(but the tx shows immediately in your wallet)

Spending BTC from coinbase wallet to coinbase merchant is instant (I.E. Coinbase to purse.io)

There are rare exceptions to this like fraud and asset forfeiture where you may be restricted. (why you should not store BTC on coinbase or any exchange)"
273,The BTC to BTC tx is held up by fiat ACH purchase. Once the hold is lifted there is no restriction
274,Huh I’ve heard of a 24 hr wait but I’ve only used/discussed one type of private wallet so my info is limited.
275,Other exchanges Bitcoin shows up in just 1 conformation. 3 confirmations is not necessary.
276,"Yes, every exchange has its own security standards and assumptions. IMHO the amount of confirmations required should dynamically adjust based upon multiple variables for best security but than there is customer support to consider so I understand why they have set amounts"
277,I think anyting under $50 should be zero confirmation but that would never happen.
278,"For established accounts with a history , yes... probably under 100 even"
279,Exactly. Nobody is going to jeopardize their level 3 verified account to try to double spend $100.
280,"Difficulty is a variable set by the network every 2016 blocks based on how quickly those blocks were found (every two weeks). The difficulty is set so that the next 2016 blocks should take about 10 minutes each.

Your odds to find a block is your hash power divided by the total hash power of the network. This is because mining is a competition.

When you mine in a pool the likelihood to find a block is the hash power of the whole pool divided by the total network hash power. Even though the likelihood of finding a block goes up with the pool it does not necessarily increase your personal reward because the pool will typically split the reward between miners by their hash contributions and charge a fee.

In my explanation the odds of finding a block are per block, so those are approximately the odds every ten minutes. You can find the total odds of finding a block within a better time set, like the difficulty period of 2016 you can take the 1 minus the percentage for a single block to the power of 2016 for the odds you WON'T find a block in that time period."
281,"Hashing is a guessing contest. The SHA2 algorithm is designed to produce a random distribution of results. Satoshi's words explain the relationship between work and the size of the target range  

> The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash

https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf  

Bitcoin mining no longer uses the ""number of zero bits"" at the beginning to define the target hash. Instead the target is defined as a maximum value, because this can be adjusted more finely. Counting the leading zero bits only allows for adjustment in powers of two. The target is a range - from zero to the current maximum. The average amount of work (number of hashes) to find a hash within the target range is dependent on the current size of the target range, a smaller range requires more work  

> if I take part in a bigger mining pool that collectively has more hash power compared to a smaller pool, does it mean I'm more likely to win bitcoins in the pool with higher hashing power?

You personally have no more chance whether you're in a big or small pool. You will earn your share of the pool's winnings according to the pool's sharing rules  

A pool with a hash rate of 20 Exahashes per second is twice as likely to find a block as a pool with 10 Exahashes per second. In practice, a miner will earn the same amount in either pool. In the 20Eh pool she will earn half as much per payment, and be paid twice as often"
282,"It's like playing the lottery. If you buy one lottery card you may win. If you buy 10'000 of lottery cards and play your likelihood to win is increased by the factor of 10'000. 

But still very very very slim.

Same with mining. You invest in hardware and energy. Even if you have hundreds of miners running. You probably never solve the hashing puzzle. That's why you enter a mining pool. If someone in the pool wins, 12.5btc are equally shared based on how much hashing/guessing you brought to the pool.

Profitable private mining ended early 2013.

283,"Awesome, this is super helpful. Thanks a ton."
284,"*mind-blown*, this totally makes sense now. Thank you so much. Just a follow on question, with regards to the pools sharing rules. I understand there are different payment approaches adopted by different pools. I also read up that one gets paid based on the amount one contributes as hash power to winning the block. 

Now, based on pay per share, how does one know if they are being paid accurately by the pool for the amount of hash power one contributed? Could there be instances where the pool doesn't pay the miner a fair amount for their contribution? Is it possible for the miner to verify how much he/she contributed? 

Thanks in advance, much appreciated."
285,"Thank you, this helps me put things into perspective."
286,"Good questions. Ask a miner  
/u/bitusher can you answer ""how does a miner know his pool is paying fairly?"""
287,"/u/Triggyversys

Since orphan rate is so low these days due to improvements in block propagation (Improvements like FIBRE) , one can get a pretty good idea just from their hash rate contributed and expected returns with calculators like - https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/calculator

Some pools like Slush's even have a method to prove their total hashrate thus allowing you to determine your % share and expected payouts are fair as well- 

https://slushpool.com/help/hashrate-proof/

Slightly related is the introduction of stratum V2 which prevents your hashrate from being hijacked

315,"Bitcoin is an irreversible payment. Because of this alone you risk losing the BTC and the payment due to charge back risks.

Because of PayPal and Skrill terms you also risk losing your account with them if that were to happen. PayPal will always side against the person selling BTC.

Most people's next question is usually something like ""how likely is that"". Very likely.

And the next question, ""how do I avoid it?"". Sell the BTC for the payment, but don't send the BTC for 180 days. If you find any person or business interested in this deal, let me know.

I think coinbase offered selling for PayPal. I'm not sure if they still do. While you might be inclined to trust this, the fees are insanely high for selling.."
316,"of course. bitcoin wallets don't do KYC nor do they have owners names attached...that's kinda the point.

if anyone in the world wants to pay you btc, yes, you can still use the Bitcoin deposit option in Skrill. Skrill just uses Bitpay to generate their invoices, and hold their Bitcoin. YOU are not using Bitpay, just sending TO Bitpay."

If you haven't already, I'd recommend doing as much personal thorough research as you can. The more you learn about what Bitcoin is/how it works etc, the better informed your decisions will be when you do come to buy. 

> where I should buy it from?? 

In terms of actually buying, it depends on where you live. It's easy to buy from an online exchange (similar to buying from an online foreign exchange company) - you'll create an account and follow their process to [buy Bitcoin](https://www.coincorner.com/). If you're in the UK/Europe, you might like to try CoinCorner - we've been in the industry since 2014 and make it easy for beginners to get involved. :)"

321,"It depends on your country. Where are you from?You can use Kraken, Coinbase, Binance etc. But, as a researcher on this market, I found that the 1st level investors or traders choose Binance. You can also browse localbitcoins.com, but before making any trade  or investment have a good research."
322,It's depends on where you are located. However you can try AtomicWallet. It's a non-custodial crypto wallet that support purchasing of cryptos with your bank card.

327,Your desktop wallet can be a watch only wallet that allows you to receive funds as well as create the transactions that you then take offline to sign with your coldcard.
328,"The Coldcard has no ""blockchain knowledge"". It only understands individual Bitcoin transactions, and how to sign for them.

You need a software wallet to detect payments to your wallet, and to construct and bring the PSBT the Coldcard signs.

If you're a fairly advanced user you can use Coldcard(or any other popular hww) with Bitcoin Core, and I'd suggest doing that."
329,"The main reason for using  a hardware wallet with desktop wallet is the user interface a desktop wallet gives you. Plenty more options, bigger screen and easy navigation. 

I have not used Coldcard before with a desktop wallet  but I am guessing the Desktop Wallets do not hold your funds and are just an interface for connection. So in that sense, your private key and security is on the Coldcard and this lessens the risk of any exposure."
330,"Electrum is just the interface to interact more easily with the coldcard. The coldcard is a small device and has no way to  connect to internet. It is difficulty to feed it the address you want to send to so it's easier to interact with it through Electrum. Electrum touches the private key that is found on the Coldcard. You only add the ""public master key"" from the coldcard, which is safe."

334,"1) cash app and coinbase pro have no withdraw fee so both are fine. Never withdraw with regular coinbase because they overcharge on a fee. 

Here is a comparison - 

**Coinbase pro**

Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They have a fee of 0.5%

OK- they receive with P2SH segwit 

Bad-  they dont batch anymore on withdrawls. It takes a week for you to ACH them fiat 

**Cash App**

 Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They batch txs as well in a sophisticated manner where you don't have to wait.(last time i waited 1 min for a confirmation and the UTXOs where batched with a bunch of txs). You can instantly lock in the price

OK- The fees are higher than coinbase pro being at ~1.7% but actually lower than coinbase(1.49%) because their spread is higher (cash app is usually cheaper market price than coinbase ). Being that you can instantly lock in the price unlike with coinbase pro there is a role here even at the higher fee. 

Bad-  to deposit BTC they still use legacy addresses (not even P2SH segwit)

The private key opens the back to take the money out. Actually when you send, it signs a transaction that will be another input.

I think you are confused about return address? 

When you send BTC your wallet aggregates the best unspent outputs UTXO together. Like real cash. You want to buy something for $9.90. You get all best fitting change so that you will get the least change in return. The wallet will do that for you. The return goes back in a new address that you wallet created on the fly with your private key for you. You don't have to create that address by yourself. Every HD wallet does that for you.

&#x200B;

""WITHDRAWAL

## Q. How long do withdrawals take to process?

## Q. What does it mean ""You can withdraw your funds only on address, which is registered and verified with your account? To verify your address with your account, you need to make a deposit from this address.""?

It means that verifying your identity through deposit helps prevent fraud and ensures that no one, except you, is able to use your payment information to make changes. Click to Deposit at the left tab, select the required amount BTC that will be added to your account balance, send BTC from any external wallet, where you are going to withdraw in the future, ( Blockchain, Coinbase, etc.) to the address at deposit application and the verification process will be completed automatically, you will be able to withdraw your funds instant.""

Conclusion

1. The funds he will send you are useless, because you can't transfer them outside that cryptobull site, and you can't use them anywhere outside of it.
2. The scam in this, it's to make a deposit some funds to verify your blockchain address in order  you  be able to make external withdrawal ""wich will never gonna happen"" because all this scam story goes on this deposit that he wants you to make.
3. he is the owner of this scam platform, because he was asking me to if i'm having an account on it , like it's a famous platform but it's only 26 days old.

so i agree with  [bitusher](https://www.reddit.com/user/bitusher/) steps, always follow them when you want to receive bitcoin payments.

Best solution is to instabuy with coinbase or cash app on hard dips if you lack preloaded fiat in coinbase pro , and once you wait a week for your fiat to clear have multiple buy limits in coinbase pro to auto pickup and dips . If the buy limit orders do get get filled than after a set interval of you choosing make a market buy to DCA (Dollar cost Average)

You can DCA twice a month with your paycheck or once a month in addition to the buy limit orders. 

Make sure you have a fiat savings account for emergency and you make a spending budget to reduce expenses as well.

Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They have a fee of 0.5%

OK- they receive with P2SH segwit 

Bad-  they dont batch anymore on withdrawls. It takes a week for you to ACH them fiat 

**Cash App**

 Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They batch txs as well in a sophisticated manner where you don't have to wait.(last time i waited 1 min for a confirmation and the UTXOs where batched with a bunch of txs). You can instantly lock in the price

OK- The fees are higher than coinbase pro being at ~1.7% but actually lower than coinbase(1.49%) because their spread is higher (cash app is usually cheaper market price than coinbase ). Being that you can instantly lock in the price unlike with coinbase pro there is a role here even at the higher fee. 

Bad-  to deposit BTC they still use legacy addresses (not even P2SH segwit)"
395,"I've been buying small amounts every week or every couple of weeks for nearly two years before I started spending bitcoin on a regular basis. I was getting into it rather slowly while doing tons of research on how banking and fiat money works, privacy, Austrian economics, etc.

Wouldn't change a thing. I feel my decisions are grounded in knowledge and understanding rather than shady investment advice from strangers."
396,"Let's say you buy at 7000 and sell at 9000. Then it goes to 12000. What do you do then?

  


The easiest is to buy and not sell for years, hoping that it keeps going up in price like it has for 10 years."
397,I started out trading $50 in and out on the exchange for small profits daily and consistently. While at work on my phone And I take the extra earning and save it into my hard wallet.
398,"I buy the dip and than it dips some more, so I buy some more, lol.

Was thinking the same as you before, making some quick profits, even daytrading, but many will loose that game.

I might sell a bit when we are reaching all time highs and buy back in at the dip. But even that is hard to predict."
399," I dont buy/sell that much honestly  
When short trade I usually send funds to my USDT wallet from \*token\_name\* and back  
When long hodl I just buy needed amount of coins and just don't touch it in a long period   
If I need to buy for fiat I usually use some exchange like bittrex  
But for casual short tradings I use hd mobile wallets like ownr or coinomi"
400,The peak to 9k and drop back to 7k was just because China said they were gonna legalize crypto and then they were like “haha sike bitch” so they influenced the market. Drastic changes like that aren’t too common without outside influence.
401,"Thanks! I still have a ton to learn before I earn. Do you see bitcoin as an investment or is it simply your preferred way to hold money? If you do see it as an investment how long did it take you to a) really understand the market and b) to actually start making money?
Also how long have you been using crypto and do you think your net worth has increased significantly since you started using it?"
402,"Thanks, I've really been looking to make side income and crypto fascinates me so I thought that it might be a good place to start. I obviously have a lot of research to do before I even start putting money down. But I have a few questions:

1. When did you start to see the value of your investments rise?
2. Did you ever lose money on your investments in crypto? If so, how often?
3. Do you feel like your net worth has significantly changed since investing in crypto?"
403,Cool that sounds like what I want to do. About how much did your money grow in the first year?
404,So it's really mostly about watching the price every day?
405,What is *token_name*?
406,"> Do you see bitcoin as an investment or is it simply your preferred way to hold money?

To me Bitcoin is **p2p currency** where I save 15-20% off amazon and save with other companies

To me Bitcoin is a **microtipping solution** due to lightning wallets that I cannot do with fiat 

To me Bitcoin is a **insurance hedge** to protect against civil/asset forfeiture

To me Bitcoin is **Digital gold** and a highly appreciating uncorrelated asset class

To me Bitcoin is great for **regulatory arbitrage** whether that is donating to Wikileaks or deplatformed/debanked individuals, capital flight, or removing financial censorship 

To me Bitcoin is a **smart contract platform** where I can write and use scripts that I cannot do with fiat

To me Bitcoin is a **payment rail** where I can send money to employees internationally 

To me Bitcoin is a **truth timestamping database** where I can lock a contract or tweet  into the blockchain and prove its existence on a certain date/time

> Also how long have you been using crypto and do you think your net worth has increased significantly since you started using it?

Not a smart idea for opsec to discuss these matters"

408,"1. Almost instantly since I started buying right after the bubble popped in 2013.
2. Yes, once by trying to time the market and once by buying shitcoins. Fortunately I was quick to learn and never repeated that mistake.
3. It definitely has, but I don't really look at it as an investment. I see bitcoin as better money and I'm never gonna sell more than I need to cover my living costs.

AD1: by almost instantly I meant several months. Forgot to mention I have a really low time preference."
409,"You’re going to get very little accomplished with $50... at most you can test theories/strategies with this amount of money. Think about it - if BTC goes to $1m, you’re going to have less than $7,000 to show for it. Don’t even bother buying a hard wallet until you have at least a half a BTC. Learn your indicators and put some work into it."
410,"Thanks, I'm willing to wait a couple of years for it. I was hoping to bring in more income yearly using bitcoin as an investment piece."
411,"Yeah I plan on just investing a piece of my paycheck in it every month. After a year of investing do you think it is possible to have a significant profit? Like enough to essentially give myself a ""bonus"" on my income without seeking off all my coins?"
412,"I think now is a good time to get into it and start stacking. With only 170 days untill halving and growing uncertainty around central banking it's shaping up to be a very interesting couple of years.

Good luck and enjoy the ride!"
413,"Of course you can if you can have trading discipline. Learn Stochastic RSI, Bollinger Bands, and your moving averages. You can play a few coins (stay away from shitcoins) that have enough manipulable price action to get you what you want... Just be careful right now as BTC 7k support is weak, play it as such. 

I always used to say I wanted to hold BTC so I wasn’t the guy with all the stocks and his dick in his hand if the market went to shit... In my opinion though, if you want to make yourself a bonus, learn your option contracts and hit the street. BTC is baby money comparatively! I would more so view it as an investment, less of a trading instrument. To each their own though! 

Cheers mate, & good luck!"
414,"Thanks! Can you clarify a few things for me?

1) what do you mean 7k support is weak?

2) when you say ""learn your option contracts and hit the street"" are you talking about the stock market?"

How Bitcoin works under the hood: 
https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test--part-ii-/"
419,General redditquette would usually suggest you read the links on the r/bitcoin sidebar first.
420,Well I guess he answered it...
421,"No matter what, don't respond to any private messages about bitcoin. Period.

Any questions you have or feedback you need, do it with posts and comments on this subreddit or one of the others. Transparent always."
422,I’ll be looking out for them! Thanks buddy!
423,"From what I understand vbyte essentially measures how much weight your transaction data is and how much of the block you'll take up. If you set your fee to 1 sat/vbyte and your transaction is 350vbytes. The total amount of fees you'll pay is 350 sats. 2 sats/vbyte = 700 sats total fees.

The higher your fee the more likely a miner is to stuff your transaction into their block. Estimating fees isn't too hard but it may be worth sending a handful of small transactions and seeing how long they take to confirm for yourself. Depending on the day and how busy the network is, 1 sat/vbyte fees usually clear in a few hours for me (5-8). I haven't yet had a transaction take longer than 16 hours or so. 5 sats/vbyte will usually get you in around an hour.

Keep in mind in my experience the network is usually kind of quiet. Except for some days when whales are consolidating utxos and taking up the mempool.

Edit: To be clear, fees are only paid when sending money out of your wallet. Fees are attached to your transaction data to pay the miners who secure the network via mining."
424,"With GW you also can increase the fee later. GW has the ability to RBF. Replace by fee. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Replace_by_fee

I always check on https://whatthefee.io/ first. But then sending with 1sat/byte.

Simplified: a transaction (tx) takes around 300bytes. It depends how much inputs you have. A good wallet always tries to figure out the best way. Think about inputs like small change in your wallet. If you need to buy something for 9.90 you give two 5$bills instead of nine 1$ and a lot of cents. = Heavy tx = more bytes = higher fees.

So if your tx is 300 bytes and you pay 1 Satoshi per byte you end up with a fee of 300 sats on top of what you want to pay.

Of course it doesn't have to be anything this complex, but I'm visualizing a web of transactions, with each output being scaled according to it's size (maybe the log of size to normalize a little?). But definitely something that allows you to see three or four levels of transactions at the same time.

485,Ya that’s robbery bud I don’t give two flying shits what the cost of hardware is. Eat the cost. 4-7% is obscene. Around here none below 10% most 14% and they hide it in greasy ways I SHOULDNT HAVE TO CHECK THE FUCKING PRICE OF BITCOIN EACH TIME I GO TO AN ATM. Not ranting at you but I’m not in the habit of getting raped Nd we aren’t putting atms on the fuking moon
486,I agree that atms should often be more clear on the specific fees instead of hiding it in the float but the fees are often a reflection of costs otherwise a competitor would come in an undercut them.
487,"Eat the cost?

Why the fuck would they run an ATM if theyre losing money????"
488,Set it up more intelligently then. Banks eat the cost. Charging 3$ per transaction which the atms ALSO DO AND THEY DONT FUCKING LIE ABOUT THE PRICE OF BITCOIN STEALING SHITTY CUNTS
489,">Is it a smart idea to wait for a big high, sell, wait for a dip and buy again (and repeat) or would this be a bad decision?

This is  bad decision as you are essentially day trading and will tend to lose money. We must have humility and understand that we do not have more than the intelligence of the markets and anyone that claims they can predict the price movements is ignorant or lying

Best solution is to instabuy with coinbase or cash app on hard dips if you lack preloaded fiat in coinbase pro , and once you wait a week for your fiat to clear have multiple buy limits in coinbase pro to auto pickup and dips . If the buy limit orders do get get filled than after a set interval of you choosing make a market buy to DCA (Dollar cost Average)"
490,"One thing to look out for if you do this is taxes depending on where youre located. I believe every time btc is transacted it is a taxable event and must be recorded as such. Unless you keep it over a year at which point you only worry about the long term capital gains tax. 

As for volatility though, I would imagine it will continue to be pretty volatile for awhile. Its becoming more popular but is by no means near consistent use or full scale implementation."
491,"- bitcoin is always volatile so there will be plenty of opportunities in the future

- buying and selling for profit is called trading and most people who try to do it lose money. if you want to do this then register on bitmex and learn how to use that exchange. they let you leverage your holdings so you can make (or lose) more money! there's a subreddit for trading as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets

- a more reliable way to make money is to simply hold on to your coins and wait for them to appreciate in value. this can take years though."

499,Well I sell bitcoins also and I deliver within minutes 😎
500,"You can use credit card for instant purchase on Coinbase. It has higher fee though.

Btw I do send money via international transfer to Coinbase and if I send money in the morning, it's deposited on Coinbase in the afternoon."
501,"14 days is not normal after you have a history with them but occurs sometimes when you first verify the account and first make a purchase. Normally the coinbase pro freeze for fiat deposits is a week with most banks . With regular coinbase you lock in the price but wait a week for the btc to be unfrozen 


**Coinbase pro**

Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They have a fee of 0.5%

OK- they receive with P2SH segwit 

Bad-  they dont batch anymore on withdrawls. It takes a week for you to ACH them fiat 

**Cash App**

 Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They batch txs as well in a sophisticated manner where you don't have to wait.(last time i waited 1 min for a confirmation and the UTXOs where batched with a bunch of txs). You can instantly lock in the price

OK- The fees are higher than coinbase pro being at ~1.7% but actually lower than coinbase(1.49%) because their spread is higher (cash app is usually cheaper market price than coinbase ). Being that you can instantly lock in the price unlike with coinbase pro there is a role here even at the higher fee. 

Bad-  to deposit BTC they still use legacy addresses (not even P2SH segwit)

>Are there any ways to get coins instantly or within a couple days?

507,First time I did it took 12 days when I paid with my bank paired debit card. Second time was 14.

511,Can you trade/send bitcoins to another wallet on cash app?

513,Commenting to get updates. Am also curious about this
514,What country is that if you don't mind me asking? Is bitcoin prohibited over there?

522,"Thanks for your help 

I see a buy and sell option, but no trade under this tab.

Any suggestions?"
523,Possibly because your account isn’t old enough or high enough level. I can send mine instantly unless it’s above like $300. If it’s above that threshold they put a 3 day hold on it but I can bypass that hold by uploading a selfie and my drivers license and it will send instantly.

It is up to the merchant or receiver to refund the Bitcoin if they want after it has been confirmed. Before it has been confirmed there are ways to get it possibly reversed.

>I'm curious to know what happens if you ""send"" to an address that doesn't exist.

Bitcoin was designed with a built in checksum(all address types have this) to make sure this is extremely unlikely to occur. The new address format even has a more sophisticated checksum that can even tell the wallet where the error occurred within the address and assist the user in correcting it and is so sophisticated it will **guarantee detection** of a typo even if you make up to 4 errors within an address -

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki

The native segwit format is designed with other clever tricks -

1) all lower case to allow for communicating verbally without mistakes easier and more fluid to communicate

2) Uses a character set that eliminates visual similarities

characters “1”, “b”, “i”, and “o” are not used in the address set , and 1 is only used as the seperator thus the address starts with bc (for Bitcoin)  and 1 (separator) than  the data part. Other commonly mistyped characters are targeted by the checksum to be detected as well 

3) An incredible amount of testing and computer cycles has gone into insuring the robustness and probabilities of this checksum 


>Isn't it possible to ""fat finger"" when typing an address, make a mistake, and actually input an address that doesn't exist yet? What would happen in a scenario like this?

The wallet would say invalid address and prevent the tx because the checksum doesn't match in +99.9999% scenarios"
532,"[1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE)

Here is one such address.

A bitcoin address is a hash of a public key. If you construct the hash to be something, then chances are no one will be able to find anything that hashes to it, never mind a bitcoin public key. There is however no mechanism which prevents you from sending to such an address. This is known as burning coin, the coin is effectively destroyed.

Notice how the last few digits are random values. That’s because in classical bitcoin addressing, that is a checksum. Everything before that produces the hash, that last part is just to make sure the key was typed correctly. If you were to fat finger an address, that would catch it, it can fail but only in 1 in 4 billion times.

So long story short, you can't accidentally send coin to a wallet that does not exist. If you fat finger, there are mechanisms that protect you. Addresses that do not have corresponding wallets do exist but you would have to deliberately send to them, you can't fat finger them, and these addresses have to be specially crafted to pass checks."
533,"So, this is just my understanding. Someone please correct me if I am wrong. 

All valid Bitcoin addresses exist. Most of them just have an unknown private key. You can always send Bitcoin to a valid address. Someone knowing the private key or not is not registered on the blockchain, and when creating an address you are not telling anyone that this address is now taken.

When ""creating"" an address you are simply taking the easy way through the trapdoor function. Starting with the address and going the other way is practically impossible."

You're arguing about whether you were sent 8400 or 9500. That's your mistake. You should have agreed the Bitcoin amount with the sender before the transaction because the USD value of Bitcoin is volatile. By agreeing the USD amount, you let the sender choose how much Bitcoin to send you"

584,"Interesting, I did not know that"
585,sounds plausable. you can transmit bitcoin any way you can transmit any other data
586,"The network of Bitcoin nodes is a core, integral part of the Bitcoin system. You can create and sign a transaction without an Internet connection, but it must eventually be transmitted by some means to the network in order to have a real effect. The whole point of having a network is to have many parties validating transactions and enforcing immutability of the ledger. (Miners are also critical for the immutability part, but the non-mining nodes make it more robust.)

That said, NFC can be a way to communicate transactions. Let's say, for instance, one person has an Internet connection, and another doesn't. The person without the connection wants to make a payment. They could create and sign a transaction, then send it to the person who does have the connection, via NFC or whatever, and that person can then relay it to the network. There have already been experiments to do offline transactions. But of course, there's a problem of the sending device knowing whether or not their transaction was received, as this will affect all further transactions that device will try to make using change outputs (i.e. outputs that return to you the portion of a transaction you want to keep) of that transaction.

Some way to verify whether a transaction has been mined yet or not is also a good idea, because a transaction is not really ""official"" until it's in the blockchain; it's always possible for a transaction to never get mined and just be forgotten by the network, since nodes will drop transactions that have been in their mempool for a long time when they run out of space. For this purpose, NFC may not be usable. It's very slow, for one thing."

594,"I have had several people reach out to me after losing funds because they thought ""digital"" was better.

Storing a seed digitally tips the balance away from resilience to gain a small increase (unnecessary) in security. More people lose money to accidents and data corruption than theft, especially physical theft.

A paper seed is better, safer, more resilient. A digital copy of a seed is dangerous. 

Use the tech as designed. Follow the instructions developed by security experts. Stop trying to tweak and ""improve"" the security of the system. BIP39 with paper backups is the correct and best method. It is carefully calibrated to balance security and resilience.

To answer your points more specifically:

* digital can have extra layer of encryption

BIP39 seeds can also have an extra layer, using the additional passphrase. Unlike your DIY encryption, this is based on a standard. If something happens to you no one will be able to figure out how you encrypted it. In addition, you have to backup the encryption key, which opens a whole other set of problems. This is easiest with a passphrase, but still difficult. Most people don't need this.  

* digital is smaller and more convenient

Not once you consider the device you need to write to the digital storage. A USB drive needs a laptop. That laptop is the biggest source of additional risk and needs to be stored with the USB device. You can enter a 24-word seed directly into a hardware wallet (on screen word selection) while connected only to a battery (charger brick) over USB cable. 

* digital is not an obvious secret/password

True, but that's security by obscurity, not real security. Anyone who knows what a seed is can also find out you have crypto and search for an encrypted digital device. You're only making it hard for anyone who might inherit your crypto, if you care about heirs or dependents. Keep it simple. 

* thief can make a picture of written phrase, not knowing somebody stole your seeds. 

Thief can make a copy of a digital device and crack the encryption passphrase at their own leisure. In both cases you need to physically secure the key material (locks, keys, safes) and preferrably use a tamper evident mechanism (sealed tamper-evident opaque bags work great for seeds)

* someone not tech savvy, will find your bootable storage device useless as he can't read it in windows/mac

Again, security by obscurity. You are more likely to lose access due to a data corruption accident. Keep it simple. More people have lost bitcoin this way than you can imagine. I know, they often email me and ask for help. 

* thief that doesn't know anything about Bitcoin, will still make a picture of your seedphrase and find it out on Google.

If you leave your seed laying around, yes. But that's just poor security. You shouldn't be doing that anyway. 


Bottom line:

Digital copies of seeds are more vulnerable, introduce other risks (access device, loss of encryption key, non-standard encryption, data-loss, electromagnetic damage etc). They tip the balance away from resilience, without adding a meaningful amount of security. You can achieve the same security goals by following standards (BIP39, passphrase, SLIP39, multisig, hardware wallets). Attempts to roll-your-own security almost always backfire spectacularly. 

I advise people who store anywhere from $hundreds  to $hundreds of millions. They don't lose their funds. They don't get them stolen. They can recover from data loss, incapacity, death, ownership transitions and other life events. 

Despite all of the above, despite my endless attempts to advise people not to do this, despite writing this kind of message about once every couple of months... hundreds of people will get ""smart"" with their seeds and do something that will make them lose money. Then they email me asking if I can help and I have to deliver the bad news. Last week I got an email from someone who lost 7BTC because of getting creative and misjudging their technical expertise. 

Don't play with this stuff unless you're an expert. If you're asking these questions you are not an expert. Follow the standards, don't get ""smart"", don't lose your BTC.

596,"A written seed is ""foolproof"" as others have said. Almost all BTC losses are due to lost wallets, often due to technical failures or physical breakage of devices.

I highly recommend Tails as a cold storage option, but I would still recommend most people write the seed.

A written seed is better with an extension that isn't written. This can also be used as a dummy to signal theft.

To the pros that understand how to use digital storage both with exceptional encryption and exceptional redundancy, do what you do, some of these methods are far superior, but not foolproof."
597,"- The idea with the seed is that it's all you need to restore your wallet. So it's the backup of last resort when you have nothing else not even the wallet file encryption password.

- The wallet file already contains the seed so in a way you already have a digital copy. You may have put a password on it which is used to encrypt the file. This will stop casual snoopers though it can't really stop a dedicated attacker.

- The other thing is most people find it easier to secure tangible things than intangible ones. They are used to protecting documents and paper currency notes.

- The most important reason is that remote attackers find it easier to hack into computers or cloud accounts than to physically break into your home. So the seed on paper is supposed to protect you from remote attackers although if you have the wallet file on your PC then it is still vulnerable to such attackers.

If you're comfortable with digital backups then make digital backups. With bitcoin core at least you have to make digital backups since it doesn't generate a seed mnemonic at all."

Flash memory devices have a unpredictable total failure mode - readable one day, totally unreadable the next, not suitable for storing important information"
599,"I believe it is safer advice to give out to a general audience. There are many more ways things can go wrong compared to simply writing the seed phrase down on paper. If someone is new to crypto and don't understand why this step is so important to be secure, maybe they leave an un-encrypted version in their device, or send it to an cloud storage service because ""they store things encrypted, right?""

If you are technically literate and sure you know all the attack vectors, then a properly encrypted digital setup is possible to be just as good, if not better than writing on paper."
600,"There are viruses that look for seed words or someone's exported private key stored on the computer.  As long as you wrote the seed words on a USB stick using something like a live Linux DVD with no hard drive & no network connection (not just no internet: ""no network connection"" in case another computer on that network is infected) then that USB stick is probably ok... but inserting it into another computer later to read the seed words exposes them.  Better be safe than sorry since you are the bank.

As for analog hacks, like someone taking a photo of your paper with seed words:
 - You can write the words down out of order as long as you remember the ordering.  ie.write the words in the odd numbered spots, then continue entering in the even numbered spots.  Or start writing from the middle slot towards #1, then continue just after the middle slot towards #12.  Or write them completely backwards in order etc.  This way, someone can take a photo and it won't work.  True, they could try every combination... so you could also opt to remember just one of the words and leave that off of the list... Or write more than 12 words, inserting a few you made up, where you just have to remember the pattern and the fake words.  Now you can give copies of those words to family members without worrying they'll steel you blind.  Etch the words onto a steel plate and you won't have to worry about water/fire damage.

Also practice with small amounts a lot. Transfer money back and forth between wallets and see what the experience is like waiting for confirmations and learning how to set the right fees.

> if noone would keep mining

It is false to believe that all miners will retire. Only some miners will retire  

If rewards fall for miners, some miners will retire and some will keep mining. Bitcoin has an automatic mining difficulty adjustment calculation which keeps the Bitcoin block interval at 10 minutes even if many miners retire. When some miners retire, the difficulty falls. This allows the remaining miners to be profitable"
678,"Yes, as block subsidy (new coins) is running out, mining will need to be kept profitable either by higher price per coin or by higher fees, or a combination of both. If none of those happens, miners will drop off. How many? It's unclear, because as miners drop off, the difficulty of mining goes down as well, making mining more profitable for those who stay (and again incentivizing miners to come online again).  

This is obviously a somewhat unknown variable for the future, depending on what the price of bitcoin is and how many transactions are happening.

This is an extremely unlikely hypothetical, but there are enough ASICs in existence that even if new one stopped being made and sold the existing ones would secure then network.

690,"There would be a UAHF to change the PoW algo if all ASICs magically disappeared, but again , there are far greater things to be concerned about than impossible matters.

Difficulty can only adjust downward by by a maximum of a factor of 4 to protect the network, so a more realistic concern is a massive sustained price crash where the difficulty adjustment does not keep miners profitable and hashrate drops considerably as well. Hashrate would not disappear simply because a certain % of ASICs are unattended and will continue working regardless, and many miners have sunk costs (electrical contracts or upfront renewable energy investment) and will mine regardless for some time even if it is unprofitable. Bitcoin users will still be able to tx on other layers , like offchain, sidechains, eltoo, statechains, and payment channels while blocks are slowly found until difficulty eventually finds a new level where miners are profitable. Lack of onchain security will simply prompt more users and exchanges to look for a deeper confirmation depth for concerns of security."

698,"Bitcoin mining is the processing of transactions in the digital currency system, in which the records of current Bitcoin transactions, known as a blocks, are added to the record of past transactions, known as the block chain.

A Bitcoin is defined by the digitally signed record of its transactions, starting with its creation. The block is an encrypted hashproof of work, created in a compute-intensive process. Miners use software that accesses their processing capacity to solve transaction-related algorithms . In return, they are awarded a certain number of Bitcoins per block. The block chain prevents attempts to spend a Bitcoin more than once -- otherwise the digital currency could be counterfeited by copy and paste.

Originally, Bitcoin mining was conducted on the CPUs of individual computers, with more cores and greater speed resulting in more profitability. After that, the system became dominated by multi-graphic cardssystems, then field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAS) and finally application-specific integrated circuits (Asics), in the attempt to find more hashes with less electrical power usage. 

Due to this constant escalation, it has become hard for prospective new miners to start. This adjustable difficulty is an intentional mechanism created to prevent inflation. To get around that problem, individuals often work in mining pools.

Bitcoin generally started with individuals and small organizations mining. At that time, start-up could be enabled by a single high-end gaming system. Now, however, larger mining organizations might spend tens of thousands on one high-performance, specialized computer.

In the malware  world, one of the more prevalent current threats is mining botnet infections, in which user systems mine for Bitcoin without the owners' knowledge and funds are channeled to the botnet master."

**Samourai** This has been my prefered mobile wallet for a while. Its pretty feature rich and privacy focused. What makes this app shine is coin control. Meaning, you can see each of your UTXOs that comprise your wallet balance and mark each one as spendable, or not spendable. Something that people may not like is that there is no fiat denomination so it doesn't show what your wallet is worth in fiat but you get used to it. Also it may be a bit overwhelming to see a handful of features with fancy names like Ricochet, Stonewall, Whirlpool, Paynims that might take a while to understand. I generally reccomend you use a simpler wallet if its your first time.

**Blockstream Green**: Simple, easy to use. This wallet has a great 2FA feature that if you decide to use requires you to verify with either email, sms, call, or the  Google Authenticator app every time you send a transaction. This is done using a 2 of 2 multisig where blockstream has access to to the other key. Also has a connect via Tor option. Has a great intuitive UX.

**Electrum**: Not as many features as their desktop version but still pretty great. Features 2FA using 2 of 3 multisig. A key on your phone, a key hidden away, and a key with a service called TrustedCoin. Everytime you make a transaction you will need to verify with google authenticator linked to TrustedCoin's server. You still have two keys, so if TrustedCoin disappears or is hacked you still have control of your funds.

Some other ideas to look into are cold cards, which work on a different logic altogether, and Tails live OS (electrum offline).

753,"r/Trezor, but it's your call.

But HW wallets only help to a certain degree.  Most people screw up by forgetting thier seed, passphrase, or derivation path.  Often, in an effort to secure thier seed, they will put it some place stupid.

Whether or not you get a HW wallet, the most important part will be to ensure you don't disclose or lose your seed, passphrase, or derivation path."
754,I have a ledger. It works amazing. I’d assume Trezor does as well. You should watch a YouTube video comparing the two because even though I haven’t used a Trezor myself I hear it’s a great wallet just like Ledger.

763,"> I am planning on making a large purchase soon and want to use Wasabi to coinjoin all of my BTC.

OK.. you've done your research so you know that each coinjoin requires about 100 mBTC to participate right?  Also, you probably want to break your coins up into 100 mBTC per address before you join.

> Once the purchase is made and they are all coinjoined, I want to send them back to the trezor. 

OK.. here's where it gets tricky.  First off, after your conjoin don't mix any laundered coins.  For each laundered address, send to a unique Trezor address.  Always keep your coins seperate.  The more you mix them, the more you identify yourself.

> Since I have already sent my original coins to the trezor, does that compromise the anonymity of it?

As long as you never use the same address twice... ever... for anything... you should be fine.

Your probably going to want to post this on r/WasabiWallet, or at least search it.  This question is asked almost daily there.

> Also, how does all this work with taxes?

Depends on your city, region, country.  In my city, region, and country bitcoin is only taxed when it is converted to something besides bitcoin.  So for me... I wouldn't have to pay tax on coinjoins."
764,"Your question is basically: ""does using the same wallet mean someone can see that I used it for some coins before, and other ones now"" 

Answer: no, not unless you reuse addresses or spend 2 inputs to 1 output combining old coins with new. Since you plan on emptying the wallet of old coins first this won't be a concern, so just don't reuse addresses and you're fine."
765,"I’m just learning of bisq from your post. Can i expect the exchange rate to be less favorable when buying btc because of lower volume, perhaps slightly less efficient market, than coinbase?

766,Technically a coinjoin can be seen as a fee Incorporated into the cost basis when you sell.
767,Thats my understanding so far. Slightly higher prices but its a way better platform and just just between you and the seller/buyer. No third party or third party fees involved! There are super good videos if you google Bisq tutorial or Bitsquare tutorial (Bisq's former name)

For example, a vulnerability in the OS or browser you use could impact the security of the platform)

788,"1) For new users its typically wiser to start with a hardware wallet. electrum works great with either one. You do not need a more expensive Model T either if trying to save money. Any HW wallets listed in item 3 would be just as good and coldcard with PSBTs would be slightly more secure as you eliminate concerns with receiving a tampered HW wallet

Technically, HW wallets are not cold storage if they are ever connected to a device with internet connectivity. They are quasi cold storage insomuch as they allow you to securely transact on insecure devices where all tx signing occurs in the  HW wallet and your private keys don't leave it. Using cold card HW wallet without  even  connecting it to another device with PSBTs is an example of true cold storage . 

If you want to make some secure cold storage HW wallets are also a great tool in doing so. Make your coldstorage wallets(12 , 18 or 24 words) , test them , than reset the HW wallet and use  it as a ""hot wallet"" for spending smaller amounts

-------------------------------

Other tips - 

Do not keep your HW wallet in the same location as your backup words
The HW wallet itself doesn't need to be hidden except if you are trying to limit the amount of people who know you have Bitcoin in the first place because it protected by a pin and or passphrase where wrong entries delay retries exponentially and/or reset the HW wallet after a while.

Thus the focus should be on securing the BIP39 backup words .

1) Do not store these digitally

2) Never write down the pin or passphrase together with the 12/18/24 words

3) At minimum secure the backup 12/18/24 words on paper in a sealed plastic bag to protect against moisture or flooding. Do not laminate as certain adhesives can damage the ink.

4) If you can afford , upgrade to a metal backup (steel , copper brass... but aluminum is unacceptable)

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test/

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test--part-ii-/

5) Keep backup private and secure , whoever gets a hold of this can steal your BTC!

6) Pin you will just store in memory as that is not needed to restore a backup, but if you use the advanced passphrase feature you will need to back this up in memory and best to backup written down as well (paper or metal) . Passphrase should be kept separate than your backup 12/18/24 words

789,"Electrum on Tails is NOT COLD STORAGE

Tails is not a single purpose, limited functionality OS like those running on hardware wallets. It has hundreds of packages installed by default and runs on PC hardware and firmware that has dozens of interfaces.

Hardening a PC with Tails is like trying to build a hardware wallet on your own (DIY). Unlikely to be secure unless you are a security expert. (Hint: if you're asking this question you are not a security expert)

Don't do it, you will regret it. Get a hardware wallet"
790,"If you download the most recent tails.iso file and verify the hash, you will know electrum is authentic.

Will also protect you from malware like here: https://youtu.be/bn_mnZQUTFY"
795,"Electrum on tails on an airgapped computer would be used only to generate keys and back them up, and then wipe the device. The seed would be stored on an encrypted file and you'd just use xpub to generate deposit address. This is only if you don't want to interact with the coins and just HODL.

If you keep keys on a hardware wallet you don't know what exploits it could have and also you'd have to constantly update the device for security updates."
796,Even if I use the TAILS USB without internet?
797,"Cold storage are just keys that have never touched the internet. You just boot tails on a USB, stay disconnected from the internet, generate an electrum wallet, backup the seed, and then shut the computer down."

801,"How did you get Electrum and tails in the first place? Oh right, the internet. 

If you know how to do that while avoiding all the possible problems, like the phishing sites and malware, congratulations. 99% of users do not avoid those. They end up sending me emails about how they lost their money following bad advice on rediit. Use a hardware wallet. Leave the security to people who are experts."
802,"I wish that were true, but it isn't. You skipped several steps, like how you downloaded and verified the software. 

""Just"" is a loaded word for newbies. You are replicating the supply chain and hardening steps of a hardware wallet, only expecting someone without the technical skills to do so. I can't tell you how many emails I get from people who have lost bitcoin because they overestimated their technical skills rather than getting a hardware wallet and following the instructions without deviation.

But then, I feel that keeping up with wallet updates and protocol changes (eg. segwit) would be easier if I leave the btc in wallet.trezor.io and simply follow Trezor's one-stop-shopping model.
I have very few transactions per year, if that matters."
805,Fair point but some people dont want or cant afford to pay $70 for a hardware wallet.
806,"I get what he is trying to suggest, for most beginners its easier to simply get a hardware wallet. Both of us know how to save money and create cold storage without the need of a hardware wallet, but neither of us are beginners. I can see many cases where a new user makes a silly mistake like install an older version of tails that has an older version of electrum , than go to update it but install malware instead, or simply not update the software package and have their device connected to the internet not realizing this makes their laptop a hot wallet. All this seems like very obvious and simple mistakes but from helping new users, I see these mistakes all the time."
807,"The keys are on the trezor. You can access those keys and perform transactions from either wallet.trezor.io OR Electrum, any time you want. Neither software interface has keys or coins, they are just ways of telling the Trezor device what transactions you want to sign."
808,"If they can't afford a hardware wallet, they are probably not storing that much bitcoin. 

In which case, a software wallet is an ok alternative. 

However, I would NOT recommend a PC/Electrum solution (even though I am a big fan of Electrum). Instead I would recommend a smartphone and reliable mobile wallet app. Smartphones are much more secure (given average technical skills) than PC Operating systems."
809,Exactly. The update phishing vulnerability of electrum is precisely the kind of bug that would get a new user.
810,"Ah, thank you Andreas. I was under the false assumption that using Electrum with my Trezor meant setting up a new wallet with a whole new seed and all.

Awesome that you can use either/or anytime you want. I hear electrum lets you choose which UTXOs to spend, which I prefer."
811,"Yep , that has been patched a while ago but there are many older versions of Tails people can accidentally use. There are many nuances new beginners lack like flashing a Tails live USB and than not creating enough entropy by doing a  few random actions before creating their private keys as well.

814,"Not sure exactly what you mean by evolve and big changes but yes Bitcoin is being updated.

Bitcoin will not switch to proof of stake.

In the next 2-3 years, big changes will likely come from better privacy protection from integrating Taproot and Schnorr signatures. Also, the lightning network will likely be out of beta phase in a few years. 

Note: applications like Dapps that you are referring to do not exist on the bitcoin network. They are somewhat similar to lightning apps."

https://bitcoinacks.com/

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/"
816,">Are big changes like a switch to Proof of Stake even possible on the Bitcoin network?

I don't see this ever happening, nor would we want it to occur. There are too many Bitcoin users and developers who are aware how insecure and pointless Proof of Stake is. 

Here are the details as to why-

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9v9eum/i_think_im_late_to_ask_but_will_bitcoin_ever_have/e9agq68/

Proof of stake would not even be wise to add as an additional security mechanism either. When designing security architecture it is usually the case that using 2 solutions gives you the consequences and costs of both. 

Bitcoin already has a Built in indirect PoS regardless. Ultimately economic users control Bitcoin and any misbehavior by the miners will be met with the Users implementing a UASF or UAHF or nuclear  option of changing the PoW algo. Users might take no action for a short 51% attack that is rectified but any deep reorg or continuous 51% attack will force the users to take action manually. This indirect form of PoS is actually more desirable because the attacker does not have certainty before hand how the network will react like with a PoS coin that has this all baked into the code. This uncertainty in the outcome of an attack makes the attack less likely to be initiated and if done more difficult to carry out as the attacker is dealing with a spontaneous thinking and adjusting organism(the intelligentsia of all Bitcoin users)"
817,"PoS is never going to happen because it's not safe. 

Changes do take place but at a glacial pace. Right now they are working on adding schnorr signatures to bitcoin. You can keep up to date via [this site](https://bitcoinops.org/). There's also work happening on layer 2 i.e. lightning. That is by separate teams though."
818,"You can improve Bitcoin yourself. The main developer group is always open to new members, or you can copy the software and make your own changes. You  could implement Proof of Stake, then persuade all the node operators that your Bitcoin is better than the one they're running now"

821,"Yes, constantly."
822,"Bitcoin is constantly improving, but it is a bit more cautious than other projects."
823,"Yes, it is upgraded and able to be upgraded. Yes, bitcoin could switch to proof of stake through a hard fork.

To have these things happen there must be concensus among nodes. Bitcoin has a strong and diverse user base. Bitcoin could be changed in any conceivable way, given everyone agrees to do so. The ability bitcoin has to resist change is due to this, and the contention between each is a feature."
824,"It is open source, so the theory runs that anyone can submit change proposals. However as we learned during the BCH hard fork, changing the parameters of bitcoin is incredibly difficult because you need the consensus of miners and nodes to go with the proposed changes. 

It can be safely said that Bitcoin will never move to Proof of Stake.

When you start tails you go to options at the login screen and choose no network.

830,Question about seed. You would only know if they spend coins or signed a message and sent it to you to purposefully prove they have it without sending coins.

Another thing you can look at is [multisig](https://bitcoinelectrum.com/creating-a-multisig-wallet/). A 2 of 2 between your PC and android phone might be easier to spend from than the cold storage setup you have in mind and it'll be almost as secure."

The reason for that is that it allows you to both use Electrum (which also supports BIP39 phrases) in the online/offline mode that you have suggested (which is great) and also gives you the option to import it into a hardware wallet in the future if you decide that you want something simpler but still secure to access your funds. I cover a bit about how to do that in Tails here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5nejoEGWFw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5nejoEGWFw)

Going the BIP39 route also allows you to secure the seed phrase via a BIP39 passphrase (which also easily lets you do the honeypot thing on the raw seed without passphrase), store additional currencies, etc. There are also tools like BTCRecover that can help you recover your crypto if you have a typo in a single keyword, etc. (Basically there is a whole eco-system of stuff around BIP39 which isn't the case for Electrum's seed phrases) (Video on selecting a good BIP39 passphrase here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhjq\_1J0EbU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhjq_1J0EbU))

1) Never claim an altcoin spinoff with private keys that have btc . tx them off to a new wallet first and never reuse those keys again

2) Don't trust any of this software on your computer or cell phone . Use another computer , linux usb live drive, or VM instance or at least use a separate app 

3) don't use online web wallets to claim

Thus at minimum - 

1) Perform an onchain tx and sweep the private keys(do not import) for your Bitcoin into a wallet you control 

2) After those BTC are in the wallet you desire them to be in , use another wallet to sweep the altcoins like Bcash. Do not use the same wallet. 

3) Once you have the bcash(BCH) you can than decide to send it to a service like https://changelly.com or any other exchange for a quick swap for More real Bitcoin 
 
4) Than you can decide to claim your BSV to sell , and any other UTXo splits - https://blog.bitmex.com/44-bitcoin-fork-coins/
You always claim the highest market cap first, unless you have a lot of BTC its usually not worth it going past BSV

862,"The process you wrote out is correct. Sweep the private key into your BTC address and then sweep the private key again into your BCH wallet. You can also do it a third time by creating a BSV wallet and sweeping the private key into that wallet, too.

Regarding the ambiguity of our support article that you described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EdgeWallet/comments/dwjrnv/is_sweeping_private_keys_really_a_sweep/), a *sweep* creates a transaction and sends the funds to an address you own. *Import* means to move the private key into you wallet without actually moving any funds. 

For bitcoin and bitcoin-related currencies, Edge supports sweeping only and the app doesn't support using a custom fee when sweeping. The app support importing for account based currencies only, like XLM, ETH, and XRP.

Edit: I forgot to shamelessly plug the exchange feature of the app. Don't want to hold BCH or BSV? You can trade them directly to BTC in the app using the in-app exchange."

As of rule of thumb, using in app/wallet exchanges or instant web exchanges like changely the fees or float is typically much higher than you would get from selling your altcoins on an exchange like coinbase pro, kraken , or bistamp ... but it can be more convenient if you are just doing small amounts and don't mind paying much higher fees."

Provide your ID and SSN to someplace like r/CashApp or r/Coinbase to open an account and buy.  Should take about a week.

> I want to buy my nephew bitcoin as a present... We’re talking $50 or less.

Well giving BTC as a present makes it a bit less easy.  You will want to store the BTC in an address then give your nephew the keys.  Easiest way to do that is to use a wallet like r/Coinomi or r/ExodusWallet that support BIP39.  Many may suggest r/Electrum, but they [don't support BIP39](https://old.reddit.com/r/Electrum/comments/dld22r/help_generate_bip39_seed_and_wallets_from/).  Once you create the wallet put the 12 words (the seed), the passphrase and the derivation path in a greeting card and send it to him.

***MOST*** important is to keep the seed, passphrase and derivation path for the rest of your life.  You will likely get a call in 10 or 20 years from your nephew asking if you still have them.  If bitcoin has a 100x expansion it will sour your relationship with your nephew if you can restore his $5000 in BTC.

> The places I’ve looked at so far seem to require SSN, government IDs, and all other types of stuff.

That's the law in the US.

> Is that all necessary? 

Compliance with law is always optional.  People speed and jaywalk all the time.

> I’d rather not give that type of personal info to some random websites.

Yeah, you can use a P2P exchange, but that will likely get way more complicated.  You could try a Bitcoin ATM but 90% of them in the US are just as complicated as r/CashApp or r/Coinbase and require just as much ID."
877,"This is two questions in one - how to get Bitcoin; how to send a Bitcoin gift

3) Buy a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor and place some btc on it and give to him 

4) Consider more secure means of backing up your 12 or 24 BIP39 backups in case of floods or fire - https://cryptosteel.com/

and than load up a wallet with btc that you backup to it 

5) Buy a btc physical coin that you send btc to -

----------------------------------

Personally since your target is 50 USD gift I would use electrum to make a paper wallet (12 words) with 50 USD of BTC on it and if he is young than give the paper wallet to his parent 

or an alternative get the dual safe seed metal plate kit and 1/8 inch metal stamp kit, keep one for yourself and stamp out his 12 words for him

1) Blockchain.com is both an online and cell wallet but allows you to buy BTC and other coins from within so the scammer can help you setup the wallet and get you to buy as well without using a separate exchange on a compromised account

2) Since blockchain.com is web based they can help you set it up and secretly setup a backdoor or steal your seed keys with remote software like anydesk or teamviewer unlike a cell phone software which is more difficult. 

3) There is a user name and password for this wallet so this gives the scammer an opportunity to tell the user that they can change the password later and they still can have access via the seed or backdoor mentioned in item 4

4) They have an alternative backdoor that is misleading because a scammer can choose to not export the backup phrase and the wallet will tell you that so you think you are safe by simply changing the password , but they use a backdoor feature in blochchain wallet called ""Mobile App pairing code"" . **This means that they can pair their cell phone and steal the BTC at anytime in the future with this pairing code even if you change the passcode and they don't have your backup words**"

**Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro vs Cash App** 
-------------------------------------------

All these companies are insured and very easy to setup and verify with great UX. Due to its simplicity Cash App is a little easier to use out of the 3. All these methods require AML/KYC verification, cash app delays this until you withdraw the BTC.

**Coinbase.com**

**Pros**-- Easier to Use than coinbase pro. Allows you to lock in a price (but have to wait ~1 week) for BTC to be released which is helpful during a bull market.  

**Cons**

Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1KwAZKGts, ~1 week delay on withdrawing Bitcoin, more complex to use than cash app, highest fees with 1.49 % bank transfer and 3.99% debit card fees, overcharges on withdrawal fees or onchain transactions 

-------------------------

**Pro.Coinbase.com**

**Pros**-- Lowest fees of the 3 when you use a buy limit order = 0.5%, unlike coinbase pays for your onchain withdrawal fee(But the week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on fiat arriving preventing buying can make you lose BTC unlike the other 2)

**Cons**

Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1KwAZKGts, ~1 week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on depositing fiat with bank transfers before you can buy BTC, most complex to use of all 3

**Pros**-- Easiest to use of the 3, Best alignment with Bitcoin politically, Allows you to lock in the price immediately and withdraw quickly(once verified), No fees to buy Bitcoin or withdraw bitcoin

**Cons**-- Only available in USA, despite having no fees their spread is slightly wider thus making them slightly more expensive that coinbase pro typically

-------------------


Cash App charges no fee but has a larger spread of ~1.6% compared to coinbase pro on average. Thus you will pay 1.45% more than coinbase pro. The retail side of Coinbase allows you to buy with 1.49% with an ACH but will typically make you wait a 7-10 days to withdraw your BTC. This rate might seem cheaper than cash app but their spread is different in the retail side(coinbase.com) thus it comes out to around the same rate or slightly worse than cash app. Cash app allows you to withdraw BTC much quicker than coinbase as well.

Thus , if you want to wait a week you can save a dollar , but also likely buy BTC at a more expensive amount in a bull market.

------------------------

**TL;DR**

Good idea to setup an account with either ""Cash app and coinbase pro"" or ""gemini and cash app"" if you are in the USA. Unless you live outside the USA , you should never use regular coinbase due to the fees. 

Use cash app during a bull market where you need to instantly lock in the price. Perhaps use coinbase pro in a Bear market where the delay won't hurt you or if you need to sell some Bitcoin.

**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange. You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys. After buying your bitcoin withdraw them to your personal wallet**"

951,"no because if they can't see what they are signing then they won't be able to vet the transactions. they would be signing blindly which means you lose out on the oversight.

what you can do is a multisig setup between multiple devices that *you* own. that way you control the wallet but anyone who wishes to steal from you will have to compromise all your devices.

for example electrum has both PC and android versions so you could setup a 2 of 2 wallet between your phone and your computer. there's a multisig guide for electrum [here](https://bitcoinelectrum.com/creating-a-multisig-wallet/) if you're interested in that. but do note that electrum relies on remote servers for transaction data and those servers see all the addresses in your wallet. these servers are run by volunteers."

**TRADING**
 

Welcome to the hardest game in the world.  
Unfortunately, you're playing with some of the sharpest, fastest, most intelligent,
well informed, stubbornly irrational and in many cases, unethical minds in the world.

You're up against the computer that can react faster than you.  
The trader who has more experience than you.  
The fund that has more money than you. 
The insider that has more information than you.  
The others that will misinform you. 
The inner voice that will do it's best to undo you.

So, leave all your dreams of making quick and easy money, behind.

The first aim is survival.  
Your absolute first goal is to learn how to stay in the game.

You can only do this by mapping the territory.  
By understanding how the enemy thinks and acts.  
By having a solid game plan.  
And by picking your battles very, very carefully.

1075,"Your suggestion is ignoring the fact that the energy efficiency is much, much worse using CPU or GPU for bitcoin mining. The current generation of ASICs is not only billions of times faster than a general purpose processor, but also billions of times more energy efficient  
Therefore, the most likely outcome of a mass agreement to downgrade to laptops is the same amount of energy producing much fewer hashes  

The most effective trigger to lowering energy usage is to lower the reward below the cost of mining. The Bitcoin reward is halved every 210000 blocks, but the energy cost is not measured in Bitcoin. If the Bitcoin price falls substantially and permanently then power usage will fall in proportion  

Similarly, on the cost side, if power prices increase, there will be less power consumed by Bitcoin mining"
1076,"Thanks for your response. 

To clarify, I don't believe that miners would ever do this, I'm asking if it is theoretically possible."
1077,"Fantastic explanation, thanks - I'm in even more awe of Satoshi.

Many of these replies were quite antagonistic which is curious, generally I feel quite at home in the Bitcoin online spaces."
1078,Sure. It’s just unlikely because this is essentially a case of [the Prisoner’s Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma).
1079,"The interesting part in this rule, is that if we have an actual disaster in Europe/Asia, bitcoin will not die but it will adjust to invite more miners. It a good protection mechanism, where a bank would just declare bankruptcy.

It's not perfect because if the bitcoin community looses a lot of its computational power, then it is at risk of being outnumbered by a group willing to attack it. By that I mean : a strategy against bitcoin is to bomb the mining farms."
1080,"> Many of these replies were quite antagonistic

Most people are antagonistic to ridiculous hypotheticals  
The suggestion that **all miners** might cooperate to downgrade is ludicrous and deserves any hostility or ridicule you're reading"
1081,"**Prisoner's dilemma**

The prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher while working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it ""prisoner's dilemma"", presenting it as follows:



Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other.

1082,"Yes, that is quite amazing. This invention keeps on astounding me."
1083,"Maybe you will profit if the Bitcoin price increases while you are transferring it  

Or  
You could trade Bitcoin for USDC on Binance, transfer the USDC to Coinbase Pro and cash out USDC on Coinbase Pro"
1084,Yes but that is always the case since prices are never stable. You could also make money.
1085,"Yes, that's why I am looking into long term hodling. I don't touch it for the next 5 years. I think I will gain a lot more than trying to play in the market.

http://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price/"
1086,"Yes, the same happens when transferring stock shares from one broker to another."
1087,"What's the fee that Binance charges to withdraw though? Isn't it like 0.0005 BTC? You'll be losing 4-5 USD just by transferring out of Binance alone. Unless that amount is inconsequential. Then you should be alright anyway. The price of BTC can jump or fall, no way to really predict that."
1088,Trade into stable coin (USDT/USDC/DAI) and then trade that so you can't lose value
1089,"Bitcoin does not drop quick enough for it to matter, especially in that time frame. The drop would be insignificant.  The percentage drop would need to be  large. This is not something you need to worry about with Bitcoin. When trading some alts, the difference can be a lot more noticeable and possibly significant.

Percentage is everything with crypto."
1090,This is probably best solution. Just transfer money to stablecoin and you don't need to worry about price drops.
1091,Bitcoin drops or rises 5-10% within minutes or hours sometimes.
1092,Not smart advice considering Bitcoin is known for its “10 minute” price sways. USDC is the best way to go in this situation.
1093,Unless that stable coin is USDT
1094,Time is not the consideration. Percentage is.
1095,What's wrong with Tether?
1096,Dropped 10% for like a day before might do it again but for longer this time. Maybe try to store in a few stable coins if you're gonna keep them aside for awhile?
1097,"tether isn't the only stable coin that has lost its peg. All pegged stable coins are trusted credit systems where you ultimately must trust a central group to not over leverage and keep the peg. Much safer to deal with fiat but sketchy exchanges must deal with ""stable coins"" to get around regulations and to force loyalty like gift cards and reward points"
1098,"As sketchy as they are, exchanging into FIAT would mean having to report them in your taxes. Then there are also the withdrawal fees you'd have to cop. Yea, it's a real catch 22."
1099,"While many hardware wallets use my ether wallet, I don't think using it directly would give you a cold wallet. I could be wrong though.

The simplest answer is to get a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger. Each of these support bitcoin and ethereum already.

If you want to make your own cold storage wallet for bitcoin I recommend creating a live USB containing Tails OS. This already has electrum bitcoin wallet included. At the login screen you can go to options and disable internet, then login. You create and use the wallet in this offline environment. You can copy the wallet's master public key to an online device with electrum to track your balance and create transactions to be signed offline. Usually this is done by scanning QR codes between the two devices.

Edit: by default the Tails live USB deletes your session at shutdown. You can either create an encrypted space (tool included in Tails, do this on first boot, then restart unlocking it) or you can let it be deleted and restore from seed on a future use."
1100,Ian's BIP39 utility will let you do it offline with dice.... If you trust Ian.
1101,"My suggestion would be to create a BIP39 paper wallet that lets you store multiple currencies and also easily restore it onto a hardware wallet later if you want to move the coins around easily and securely.

I have a guide for that here: [https://youtu.be/j5nejoEGWFw](https://youtu.be/j5nejoEGWFw)

Depending on whether you want to do their verification process, you can currently get a keepkey hardware wallet over at [shapeshift.com](https://shapeshift.com) for about $10 + shipping. This is currently the cheapest option to get into the hardware wallet space that I am aware of."

1103,"Thanks for the response, I didn't even think of that LiveCD solution, probably will go with that one."
1104,"Thanks, this is actually what I was looking for."
1105,"Great guide, thanks!"
1106,"wtf do not download that.

&#x200B;

only install binaries from trusted urls"
1107,"But never use it online! Best you use a one-time boot CD like Ubuntu. So when you shut down your PC, nothing is stored anymore. Then you have to get this online website to an usb stick. Copy it to your one time boot pc, verify if that page is clean and then use it. 

Good security is hard."
1108,"Ian is a good open-source software to create your private keys.

To increase your security you can import your private keys to Ellipal Cold Wallet to create an airgapped wallet. It's not only very secure but also gives you an easy access to your coins when you wish to use it."
1109,"For OP, it would be electrum.org (but verify this information yourself)."
