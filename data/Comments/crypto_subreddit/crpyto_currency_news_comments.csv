1,"Yep, any minute now. I'm holding my breath. /s"
2,"If it was 2/3 of people who believed this that would be saying something, but 33% of people being ignorant on a subject is not really uncommon."
3,"Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that. - George Carlin"
4,Yea no
5,"This is great, it's not uncommon to see big ICO's and others end up selling their holdings all at once causing their own cryptocurrency or token to crash. This token lockup really shows investors that the STP team is serious about its project."
6,"A cryptocurrency wallet is the equivalent of a bank account. It allows a trader to receive bitcoins and other coins, store them, and then send them to other traders. A crypto-trader must think of a wallet as an interface to the Bitcoin network, similar to how online banking account is an interface to the regular monetary system. Wallets contain private keys; secret codes that enable traders to spend some coins. In reality, it‚Äôs not coins that need to be stored and secured, but the private keys that gives access to them. In short, crypto or Bitcoin wallet is simply an app, website, or device that manages private keys for a trader.

Mycelium is an open-source mobile wallet that is designed for those that wish to trade strictly in Bitcoin. The most noticeable characteristic is the user interface. Users are greeted by a clean, intuitive design with multiple setting controls, from display language and local fiat currency to the denomination of BTC the user will be dealing in. The smooth and straightforward design appeals to both novice users and more advanced traders. Mobile wallets run on an app on phone and are useful because they can be used anywhere including retail stores. Mobile wallets are usually much smaller and simpler than desktop wallets because of the limited space available on mobile.

While the Ledger Nano S is a very popular hardware wallet. The emphasis on security, as well as promoting an easy to use device, has made the Nano S an obvious choice for many crypto enthusiasts with large amounts of assets. The Nano S supports major coins like BTC, ETH, and XRP as well as hundreds of altcoins. Hardware wallets can be fit with several web interfaces that can support different currencies; it just depends on which one a trader decides to use. Users simply plug in their device to any internet-enabled computer or device, enter a pin, send currency and confirm. 

As seen in this few examples of crypto wallets, there is a wallet out there for every type of investor: from day traders on the move, holding dozens of different coins that need constant access to their funds, to the holder that rarely touches their assets. The most important step in finding a crypto wallet is examining the needs, expectations and determining which wallet best suits a trader. Finding the right wallet is the first and perhaps most important step, in exploring the distinct and profitable world of cryptocurrencies."
7, I've heard many negative comments about trezor wallet. Why isn't MyEtherWallet use?
8,"Electronic wallets have become widely accepted within the past few years. Most locations that accept cards as a payment option will allow you to pay with your electronic wallet. Although there are still some locations that are using older processing technologies, which does limit some product or service access, the number of retailers who provide payment access in this manner continues to increase each year."
9,"As smartphones become ever more pervasive in our society, consumers are gradually warming to the convenience that using a phone‚Äôs digital wallet feature provides. Think of the digital wallet as an electronic storage center where customers can securely keep their encrypted financial information."
10,Backed by Bullshit
11,Binance = Bullshit
12,I hate that he got a free ad on national television where he shits on bitcoin and gets to sing praises of Btrash
13,"Lol why would you want your cash to 1000x? That's not what cash is for. If I expected my cash to 1000x there's no way in hell that'd I'd spend it. And if I didn't spend it, my bcash would end up with the same problems that bcashers criticise in BTC. Cue the rabid bcashers with their ""saToShi NakMotO sAid biTOiN iSnt a StorE of vAlUe""."
14,BTC doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúleader‚Äù satoshi is mute. Closest is AA
15,"Well, many in the community believe rightfully, that bcash is the original btc, so I'm not sure why you're shitting on it. If you love Bitcoin, I think you'd love bch. 

I guess it depends on if you believe and support lightning network. Personally I think it's an effort by blockstream to monetize btc transactions so those with liquidity can ensure they continue to profit."
16,"BCH is and was a protested fork of Bitcoin which introduced larger block sizes. Roger tried to 51% attack bitcoin by getting miners to move to his creation and most refused. He has done everything in his power to dismantle and discredit Bitcoin ever since. If not for his scumbag manipulation and attacks on the real Bitcoin I'd have no issue with it.

Also, Bcash is not the original Bitcoin."
17,"When did he attempt a 51% attack on BTC?  Who could pull that off?

Bcash is much closer to the original Bitcoin than the bastardized version that BTC is today. Is that even debatable?

Sounds like your problem is mostly with Ver. Which I guess I get, he's not everyone's cup of tea.  But I don't think he's wrong in what he says."
18,"He attempted to 51% attack when he tried to convince miners to move to his new chain taking their hashing power with them. If successful, BCH would have taken over and he would have won the war he started against the real bitcoin. I'm not going to dig through links, direct people to docs and argue about it. Everyone is welcome to believe what they want whether what they believe is based on facts or not. Personally I think there's a reason big names in tech like Jack Dorsey are Bitcoin Maxi's. I own two other coins so I'm not Bitcoin or nothing but I won't own anything that tries to compete with, or is an attempted attack on Bitcoin. Especially when that coin has a person like Ver attached to it."
19,"tl;dr

It‚Äòs Bulgaria. The BTC is from a large-scale raid against organized crime in May 2017."
20,Hope this isnt the start of somthing particularly bad.
21,This is the first time a blockchain explorer was blocked using an internet firewall.
22,Dump incoming üìâ
23,what type of person has half a billion in bitcoin.. that's got to narrow it down to like 100 people on the planet
24,lol
25,Remembering when it was @ 3.50 üò©
26,"Is the hype finally over?

...doubt it. 

May have been a slow year but those guys know how to turn mediocre into headlines."
27,"a short way, many great achievements"
