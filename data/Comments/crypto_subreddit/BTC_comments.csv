23,"A full node verifies transactions and blocks. A light/SPV node/wallet doesn't.

A mining node is a full node that also mines blocks. A non-mining node is a full node that doesn't.

In the whitepaper, a node is a mining node."
24,Mining and non mining node is a terminology.
25,"IMO it's easiest and clearest to just say fully validating node or mining/generating node. Non-fully validating nodes are clients, usually SPV client or server client."
26,"That's a lot of help, thanks."
27,Most miners are in pools so dont run their own full node.
28,You can belong to a pool without running a full node? Are you talking about cloud mining services? I had my own ant miner when I was part of a pool.
29,"In pools, except p2pool, the pool operate is the only one with a full node and they send candidate block headers to the pool participants who mine on top of it as if it was an opaque value."
30,"In that case the mining pool runs a full node which all the miners participating in the pool operate behind. Individual miners can switch their support between pools, but the pool owners decide which full node they use."

35,"It seems you're confusing two things, storing your money yourself, or storing the blockchain.

To control your money all you need is control of your keys. There are many wallets that allow that. I personally recommend smartphone based ones, like Bitcoin.com, Badger, Crescent Cash etc. For serious amount, look into a hardware wallet or a more DIY offline wallet solution.

Storing the blockchain is a whole other thing. You'd need a node for that. Bitcoin ABC, Unlimited, Verde, Flowee, bchd are examples of nodes. 
Nodes are for a more professional usage, mainly for miners or other specific cases, not for the common user."
36,"Bitcoin-abc protocol.

It’s bitcoin-core for bch."
37,"To store Bitcoin Cash locally, the most practical way is to use a smartphone wallet like Bitcoin Wallet from Bitcoin.com, or Coinomi.

The wallet stores your coins because it has your secret number called seed, and therefore also all your secret keys, public keys and addresses.

You own coins because in your phone you have the secret necessary to transfer ownership to someone else.Therefore your coins are also in the phone."
38,The wallet doesn't work like Bitcoin's core software? it isn't stored on the local machine?

Banking the unbanked is what crypto is all about. It's where the utility and growth resides, and that means value

In order to achieve that your coin needs to be able to consistently process txs for less than $0.01 in order to be functional in the parts of the world that need it most

BCH demonstrated a bigger block is among the simplest fastest easiest of solutions to scale with demand. Proven 4mb pre-segwit Bitcoin blocks can allow millions of transactions per day indefinitely while keeping fees under $0.01

The only coin with the global decentralized hash power to properly secure its network is still hovering around its limit at 300k per day with tx fees sometimes going as high as $5 before interest drops again"

64,"So, I've been thinking a lot about this lately. I like some of the UX stuff in the Nano camp a lot (brainblocks and Natrium especially). However, I have serious doubts about the ""feeless"" concept in the long term. There is an inescapable physical limit on transaction throughput, because bandwidth between nodes is not infinite.

In economic terms, this means that nano transaction throughput is a scarce resource with no price. It seems abundant enough for now that there is never congestion, but what happens if someone wants to build a high-throughput application on top of Nano? Suppose a streaming service (like maybe Spotify) wanted to use it to charge per-second of play time? It would only take 10,000 simultaneous listeners to overwhelm the network and cause massive congestion.

A fee system is necessary in order to let people who most need that bandwidth to bid for it when it becomes scarce. There's no need to artificially limit the throughput, as happens on BTC. But there is a need for the market to be able to bid for resources in order to allocate them most effectively in the event that they become scarce. By completely omitting this mechanism, I think Nano is leaving itself vulnerable to a serious problem.

Perhaps the proof-of-work anti-spam system is enough to solve this? It depends on the extent to which it enables effective market ""bidding"" with higher proof-of-work in the event of congestion.

Also there's the concern that Nano's voting system doesn't allow nodes to independently verify which fork was chosen if they were not online to witness the vote in real time. This is a problem Nano shares with various proof-of-stake coins, and you may or may not consider it a significant issue. But the point is that there are some areas where the design of BCH has advantages over Nano. Nano hasn't made BCH entirely obsolete."

Segwit was a drastic change and it never had consensus lol. As a matter of fact, it had to be paired with the more popular option (raising the block size) to be activated to begin with. I don't know if that's propaganda or just a misinformed person but wow.

Segwit signalling never got close to majority support until the NYA. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills over here.

Edit: TheGreatMuffin is a mod of r/bitcoin. So it's propaganda. Quoted below

When I asked him about Bitcoin Cash, he said it didn't interest him because of the toxic people behind it. Namely one public figure he couldn't recall the name of."
150,"A lot of the commentary in r\bitcoin is generated by a few people.  The same thing is happening on other social media sites.

152,Honestly I don’t know what I did besides express my concerned as a longer time than most bitcoiner. It’s sad to see such suppression of conversation and opinion. How does bitcoin survive this kind of culture sans being adopted by the powers that shouldn’t be? How are $8 fees ok? I just can’t believe how far btc has fallen from its original mission statement.

162,It leaks unfortunately.
163,"You did nothing out of the ordinary. A normal person would also ask why are the fees so high, when they used to be a penny or less, not whole dollars. Why is digital cash taking whole dollars in fees like a package rather than pennies for sending some bits down the line? Isn't cash supposed to be frictionless of it all?

Blockstream and Bitcoin Core just shifted Bitcoin from p2p electronic cash to ""Store of Value"" and those who haven't been paying attention or new users asking these obvious questions are silenced rather than being educated. The goal of /r/bitcoin is not to educate new users about Bitcoin but rather to tow the Blockstream line and appear in support of Blockstream's vision for Bitcoin.

Even today, if a new account asks the obvious ""no-no"" question of ""Why didn't we choose SegWit over a simple blocksize increase"", they get censored and banned rather than have someone dig up the truth that they're trying to bury. They want that part of Bitcoin to be old history that's not mentioned like some faux-pas. How dare a new user ask why SegWit isn't giving Bitcoin low fees as promised?"
164,"> you're not going to be banned over here simply because you are a dumb shill

For your information, this sub has banned many dumb shills from the BSV camp. Many BSV people are complaining about bans and censorship in rbtc in a pretty much the same way as BCH people are complaining about bans and censorship in rbitcoin: https://old.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/b0gg6m/new_low_for_rbtc_censorship_banned_without_a/

You obviously don't see this because the posts made by these shills are deleted. And you don't read BSV subreddits, so you have no chance to see their complaints either."

215,"There are already non-custodial, non-KYC Bitcoin exchanges. Local Bcash isn't doing anything unique."
216,"This is a bit silly. Any system that takes 0-conf bitcoin (e.g. bustabit) checks if it's rbf or not (bitcoin core exposes it), and waits for a confirmation instead.."
217,thats not how RBF signalling works. A transaction inherits RBF of unconfirmed parents.
218,"This is a well known property of blockchain and 0-conf transactions. It's always possible to create two different transactions spending the same output and broadcast these two variants to the network (sometimes it's even a part of the wallet UX). Whenever a miner receives these two different conflicting transactions, he needs to pick one of these transactions to include in a block. And he may:

  * Prefer the first seen transaction.

  * Prefer the transaction, which pays more fees.

  * Respect a hint from the user (RBF flag).

BCH does not support the RBF flag, so miners only have a choice between the first two options. And

 * in some cases BCH miners prefer the first seen transaction: https://i.imgur.com/nYwQObc.png

 * In the other cases BCH miners prefer transactions which pay more fees: https://i.imgur.com/GgAzGUI.png

Everything is up to each individual miner and his own policy. So if they like BCH, then they may prefer to respect the first seen rule. But if they don't like BCH and only care about their own profits, then they may just take a higher fee. I'm not sure why BCH miners are even supposed to like BCH, considering that the BCH community has a habit of regularly [celebrating and gloating about miner misfortunes](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/d8rlix/bitcoin_core_btc_store_of_value_coin_dropped/).




So is there anything that can be done about 0-conf double spends? Yes, of course:

 * BTC has already successfully solved it by deploying the Lightning Network, which is now a preferable payment method for retail merchants.

 * BCH is planning to solve it by eventually introducing pre-consensus and has two competing proposals for this (avalanche and storm)."
219,"Please take sometime to read the article. Checking the tx itself (whether it is RBF or not) doesn't work.

As outlined in the article, if the parent of tx is RBF, tx itself need not be RBF and still can be double spend"
220,It's basically a double spend proof provided by the user directly.
221,"LOL "" BTC has already successfully solved it by deploying the Lightning Network ""   


Alright there. successful the right word for that? :P"
222,"> ...the BCH community has a habit of regularly celebrating and gloating about miner [sic] misfortunes...***of criminal saboteurs who racketeered their way into control of BTC by throwing a wrench into the spokes and then charging to fix the bike.***

223,"r/btc is in such a sorry state to have downvoted this to -6 at time of writing. They prefer feel-good bite sized simplifications to genuine technical explanations, and then complain that nobody explains technical details."
224,"Sorry, but that's entirely your misunderstanding. From:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki

and ctrl+f for ""Inherited signaling"". If any unconfirmed parents are RBF, then the transaction is also RBF.

If you don't believe me, try it on a live website like  bustabit (deposit money, then hit ""precredit"". I'll give you 1 BTC if your ""attack"" works, lol )"
225,"Even if the parent of tx is not RBF, then it can be also double spent. RBF is just a red herring."
226,"Lightning Network payments are accepted by various Bitcoin payment processors and merchants since a long time ago. And they already represent a respectable percentage of crypto payments:

229,What rabbit poop is in his comment? I dont see anything incorrect.
230,A non-RBF tx can be double spent just as easily as a non-RBF tx if its parent is an rbf tx. Any tx in the unconfirmed chain can break all of its descendants if conflicted.
231,"I guess reading comprehension is not your strong point =)

Your attack doesn't work, so why would I owe you money? Like seriously. And bustabit does support 0-conf if you click on ""precredit"" next to the unconfirmed transaction. But it only supports non-rbf transactions, which by definition the transaction is if the parent is an unconfirmed rbf."

331,"License or Permit Requirements

Under Federal explosives laws, all persons who wish to manufacture, import, or distribute explosives, including EPCDs, must acquire a Federal explosives license, and those who wish to receive explosives must acquire a Federal explosives permit. ATF license and permit requirements may be found on ATF’s website at https://www.atf.gov/content/explosives/explosives-industry/how-become-federal-explosives-licensee-FEL. In addition to an ATF Form 5400.13 — Application for Explosives License or Permit, and the application fee, applicants must submit a 2″ x 2″ photograph and a completed FD-258, Fingerprint Identification Card (obtainable through a local law enforcement agency) for each Responsible Person (RP). Further, an ATF Form 5400.28 — Employee Possessor Questionnaire, is required for each Employee Possessor (EP). An EP is an individual who has actual or constructive possession of explosive materials during the course of his or her employment with the applicant’s business. Background checks are conducted for all RPs and EPs submitted with an application.

I'm guessing he probably did not do any of this otherwise he would have never gone to prison.

EPCD is short for explosive pest control device."

It's ironic that you rag against these types of people but if they didn't use and demonstrate that Bitcoin had value as money back in 2011 we wouldn't be having this conversation today. They took the risk and they gave value to Bitcoin."

You're here trolling in the /r/btc community which is working to bring Bitcoin back on track like it once worked before a for profit Blockstream showed up and halted Bitcoin scaling. All simply because Blockstream started a chant and you mindlessly parroted all they say including, attacking Roger Ver. Roger Ver bad, BCH bad, bcash.

Not only do you not understand the community that initially gave Bitcoin it's jumpstart and showed it had value but you also completely don't understand the point of Bitcoin itself. Removal 3rd party processors and middleman which charge fees for merchants like credit cards do today as well as permissionless money transfer. You have none of that with services like the ones you mentioned. You might as well just use credit cards and save yourself the conversion fees.

Those of us that use Bitcoin today pay fees in dollars and wait for erratic confirmation times because that's the state that Bitcoin is in today thanks to Blockstream and Bitcoin Core. Tony Vays can pay $0.25 in extra fees and wait 11 hours and you don't even blink because you're using Bitcoin via 3rd parties like Bitrefill and Bitify which shield you from these onchain fees as they handle those for you during times of low volume. You miss the point of Bitcoin completely. Bitcoin was supposed to be p2p cash cutting out these payment processors so that one day Bitcoin could be used as cash. Instead you fallen back to what Bitcoin was competing against and don't understand the irony. inb4 ""But I'm spending Bitcoin"". Yup while gladly paying payment processors much like the current credit card model."

382,"What's your motivation on short block times rather than 0-conf, or first-seen-first-include at a protocol level?

394,Exactly.
395,"> not a single one of them has ever run into a scaling limit (excluding self-imposed limits)

Ethereum?

I agree with your message though. Bitcoin Cash does not have unsurmountable scalability challenges that warrant abandoning the project."
396,"I don't agree that DPoS implies de facto that a system isn't decentralized. However insomuch as the Scalability Trilemma is a real thing I choose security and scalability and leave decentralization as the 3rd option. IMO decentralization doesn't need to be a religion. We only need enough decentralization to achieve censorship resistance and we're decentralized enough.

With EARTH I want to focus on UX. I don't think that decentralization is at the front of most people's minds w/ regards to a smooth UX. However scalability and security weigh heavily on a user's mind w/ regards to UX.

Governance is also something I'm brainstorming on and DPoW enables a good governance model with staking as well as enabling 3 second block times.

I'm intending to launch an EARTH Consortium of companies which pledge to help develop the ecosystem as well as run nodes. Also there will be an EARTH specification from the beginning and I'll write the reference implementation. Governance w/ a spec and technical consortium will go a long way and are something which is sorely missing from BTC and BCH IMO. (glad to see a spec coming to BCH)

Regarding what type of users this will cater to. My goal is for every person on earth to be able to do 1000 on-chain transactions every day. Cash, tokens and smart-contracts are all first-class citizens on EARTH. Each account gets about 25 \*\*free\*\* transactions every single day and dapp developers can stake tokens to enable further daily free transactions. Along with a 3 second block time EARTH can target the cash UX. 

Solidity is the smart-contract language which I'm launching with so EARTH will have very powerful turing-complete smart contracts as well as non-fungible tokens and crowd sales. There is also a DEX. I think EARTH can position itself at the convergence of the Web, Internet of Things and Blockchain."

Do you think wealth is evenly distributed? Do you think that wealth inequality used as the basis of power for a system will exacerbate or improve the average person's lot in life?

405,"DPoS has laughably failed and continues to do so.

This thing has failed before it even started.

I have no idea why you are wasting your efforts in creating an entirely new  chain instead of creating a new sidechain to work on top of Ethereum or even BCH."
406,I think you should write a white paper and publish it before saying the world about your tech.
407,"> IMO decentralization doesn't need to be a religion.

I'm sure you know as well as anybody decentralization is the reason people got so excited about Bitcoin. Scaling and governance are solved very easily when one removes decentralization. Just hook networked servers to a central processing server, just like VISA, PayPal etc. The reason Bitcoin got saddled with 3-100 etc tps for so long is approving things in a decentralized manner is damn hard and cumbersome. Despite those challenges, which include governance problems too, people still soldier on forward. Why? Because decentralization *is* that valuable.

>I'm intending to launch an EARTH Consortium of companies which pledge to help develop the ecosystem as well as run nodes.

This is exactly what Hashgraph and Facebook's Libra announced.

>Regarding what type of users this will cater to. My goal is for every person on earth to be able to do 1000 on-chain transactions every day. Cash, tokens and smart-contracts are all first-class citizens on EARTH. Each account gets about 25 **free** transactions every single day and dapp developers can stake tokens to enable further daily free transactions.

So in your view if EARTH succeeded completely BCH would be obsolete. In other words, it competes directly with Bitcoin Cash (and arguably any other ""Bitcoin"" variant)."
408,"Keep in mind that in order to use PoS / DPoS successfully you need fair distribution of coins first. The best way to achieve it is still PoW, with RandomX and MTP being the most ASIC resistant atm. I hope you dont go the easy way and just sell the tokens..

They required you to make a ""request"" for withdrawal, which they claimed all requests would be processed on Sunday's. After sunday passed and my money had not been transferred, I reached out to their support. At the beginning, I was receiving immediate replies. They told me it would be deposited the next sunday, but they also made sure to let me know they had a promotion that would bump up your profit return percentage if investing more then $500 at a time. I talked with them for a while about that, and I TOLD them I was depositing $500 then. Immediately after, I never received a single other reply. Radio silence, up to the point that they shut down and took my money with them (I found that out myself when their site would no longer load). 

It just boggles my mind though that people like this exist in this world. Absolute idiots. I was genuinely willing to invest ALL my bitcoin to the site to allow it to gain interest. If they had just kept talking to me, they would have gotten a lot more of my money. It was a decent looking site, functioned (as far as I could tell), and was really just a cool thing to show people.

458,"First part not at all. You can’t inflate bitcoin without breaking PoW. Can’t break PoW.

Secondly the point wasn’t about how much bitcoin is worth, or how much even fiat is worth. Fiat is inflationary due to the constant printing of new money. It ultimately comes down to time preference, why would you incur the cost to convert to then simply spend something that holds value, to buy a coffee. Spend your fiat which will be inflated in the near future, and keep your remainder in bitcoin. 

The comments above me indicate that bch holds value, if this is true, then my scenario is preferred over the sole spend and replace meme."
459,"Fair enough, but BTC is ""printing"" at a rate of 4% minus coins lost until the halving. Also, there are many many cryptocurrencies (another launches each day), which, like it or not, is another type of ""supply inflation"". 

BTC is not holding value, it's fluctuating in value rapidly and is highly unstable. Like it or not, fiat currencies are the de facto standard of valuation (though I agree that fiat is inflating, without limits). But if fiat is inflating so uncontrollably, why can't BTC at least break even with it?

529,"I'm not speaking for Roger; I don't know him, we've never met.  

You have to define sanctions.  If group A decides not to trade with group B, that's not a crime.  But economic sanctions today, especially implemented by for example the US, means that group A is corralling its partners and blockading group B to prevent them from trading with others.  That's unjust.

Under the definition as applied today in the US, the principle Roger is standing on here is correct -- sanctions are a violent act every bit as much as locking someone in a closet.  Roger is basically stating the obvious.  Often the problem we face in this world is, is we don't have any principles.

Further, it's not the regime that pays the immediate price when a nation-state is sanctioned.  It's the innocents.  There may be a hope that the regime eventually pays a price.  But that does not change the fact that sanctions punish innocent people.  Sanctions have actually starved millions.  Check into democide.

All that said, in our unprincipled world economic sanctions are used in lieu of immediate and direct killing to (hopefully) goad state leaders into compliance.  I don't like this but it's preferable to going over there and stabbing everyone."
530,"Ver sometimes simplifies issues a bit too much. Sanctions are certainly bad, but they are a symptom of statism and so long as there are states they may be the least violent option in some cases. I don't know that the sanctions help anyone, but helping to enrich one of the strongest state cults who violate numerous human rights, kidnaps, imprisons, tortures and starves anyone deemed a dissonant should be at least as much of a violation of his moral code as sanctions against them.

That is simply not true. Bitcoin was split into two (a fork, as in a fork in the road), and when it happened, people had their coin amounts equal on both. So if you had say 3.5 bitcoin, you then had 3.5 bitcoin of both versions. This didn't affect the supply."

Hasn't anyone informed you yet? Fees in Bitcoin are based on size in bytes, not value transferred.

So it would be 88 cents to move $1billion, and still 88 cents to move $1.

You decide to which end of this spectrum the amounts you want to be using lie, and see if that flat rate fee (which also has a trend to get pretty higher if usage increases) makes sense for your use case."

623,"Not currently, BCH reaches a soft cap at around 25-30mb per block (this is observed from various stresstests on the actual network) which brought us to over 2million tx per day, sustained for over a day.

The reason for this limit has to do with inefficient block propagation, inefficient validation, etc. The core part of the node validation software hasn't significantly changed since 2009, it doesn't utilize multiple threads. In other words the node software is extremely archaic.

In terms of reducing block propagation inefficiency, there is this really cool tech called graphene which reduces found block size by 99.9% (the concept is that when a block is found, all other miners already have most of the tx in their mempools and don't need to download them).

For Graphene to work, we needed a way for miners to agree on a universal way to order transactions. The solution picked was CTOR (which you can look up) or canonical transaction ordering. This was merged and adopted in the November 2018 upgrade.

There's also progress in the node software, but from different angles.

The irony of you using this quote this astounding when you actually support a chain that allegedly can support 32MB blocks but has a median blocksize of [0.05MB in the recent months](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/charts/median-block-size?granularity=month).

This is **640x** what is currently used on BCH, after more than two years of *activity* and so-called adoption. This is blatant ""premature optimization"". And to reach this alleged capacity BCH has made compromises in the eligible locations and the minimum hardware requirements to be able to run a node to actually verify the transactions you receive... without actually needing it at all. So while optimizing a side of the currency, it degraded other fundamental features of it. This quote is true and applies to BCH, but not in the positive manner you think.

Oh and when I said ""allegedly"" for the 32MB, I'm referring to the fact that it was only reached during a test in production, for 5 (almost) consecutive blocks and pretty much served the purpose of showing that it caused problems for many implementations and that many miners still had soft limits in place because they most likely cannot handle this limit at all."

Of course you didn't reach them, you're currently providing 640x the necessary resources without justification for the compromises you've made to do it. Even providing 100x would be unreasonable considering the compromises in question.

As I said, your quote already applies to BCH, it has demonstrably done premature optimizations. They are not just ""trying to optimize decades early"", they have done it.

Do you know what kind of poll is harder to manipulate? It's transactions in the blockchain. Because transactions are paying real fees and would be somewhat expensive for manipulators to fabricate and keep this up for days/weeks/months.

Segwit vs. non-segwit transactions on the BTC blockchain is also a poll which is hard to manipulate. Those who are using non-segwit transactions are effectively voting for *""transaction fees are not high enough to bother moving to segwit""* and those who are using segwit are voting for *""lower transaction fees are preferable""*."

Blockstream kicking Gavin, the lead Bitcoin developer, out of Bitcoin development, successfully hijacked control over the Bitcoin github.

Mike Hearn and Gavin wanted to prevent Bitcoin from being hijacked, so they created a fork. That fork didn't survived after they were heavily DDOS. Mike Hearn was heavily character assassinated by what I believe to be orchestrated paid campaigns by Blockstream. And of course, now that Mike Hearn is gone, the character assassination campaigns are directed at Bitcoin Cash main supporters like Roger Ver.

I was involved in some BCH projects and there had been multiple DDOS attacks and other stuff, such as flooding my inbox with few hundred thousand emails per day. I'm sure those activities are not for profit, so why are they doing it?

There are actually plenty more nasty unethical things BTC people had done which is not covered in this comment. Bitcoin Cash is an attempt to rescue what the bad actors had hijacked successfully, mainly the peer to peer cash revolution. And it won't be the last time the bad actors will try to find ways to sabotage this project."
707,"On October 23, 2014, [Blockstream goes public](https://blockstream.com/2014/10/23/why-we-are-co-founders-of-blockstream.html) and announces funding and the formation of their company. Shortly after Blockstream was [incorporated](https://archive.is/qzsVe), they received [$50 million](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/blockstream-series-unknown--66d2817a#section-investors) in venture capital from AXA, Khosla Ventures, Horizon Ventures, etc., some of the most powerful venture firms in the world. The [Blockstream board of directors](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kflur/anybody_ever_find_anything_interesting_in_these/dre1508/) are all bankers.

In the Summer of 2015, all of the primary Bitcoin communities such as /r/Bitcoin, mailing lists, Bitcoin Talk, wikis, etc., began [massive censorship campaigns](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) against any and all topics that had to do with scaling Bitcoin beyond the 1MB limit which, by the way, was temporarily added by Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2010 as a stop-gap measure to prevent spam in the early days.

When you do your own research, you will find that the Bitcoin name and repository were hijacked by a for-profit organisation so they could make a buck on their own patented and convoluted ""solution"" for a problem that doen't even exist (in fact; they themselves created it). In this process, Bitcoin (BTC) was turned into an altcoin by implementing SegWit (the coin itself is no longer a “chain of digital signatures,” as per Fig. 1 of the white paper).

TLDR: [Blockstream fucked Bitcoin over](https://youtu.be/jctc85X_PCI?t=79) and r/Bitcoin bans people talking about it.

According to your interpretation.

Other interpretations are that those who are not utilizing SegWit recognize that SegWit coins are tainted, and there is already a non-zero number of vendors who will not accept SegWit-tainted coins.  And so by that very fact (and the fact that non-SegWit tainted coins can always be later tainted, but not vice-versa), SegWit coins are, and always will be, second class citizens to non-SegWit coins."

So I'm always pretty weary of theories involving government takeover of BTC (I think it's better explained by software developers with little knowledge of economics and huge ego's) but I figured let's have a look at that link of yours and read up on it a little.

The link redirects to a Steem post of 1 paragraph linking a Pastebin conversation about Peter Todd's family being threatened by an alleged government official, and another link to a 2013 thread on a Bitcoin forum where Peter Todd then allegedly responds to this conversation.

The Pastebin file doesn't exist anymore, and the conversation is between Todd and some other guy talking about SPV vulnerability and a DDoS attack that he performed.

It's so patently untrue yet gets repeated here over and over. 

Segwit2x, and its failure, was on Garzik and the others behind the NYA. They made the agreement without the participation of Core developers and subsequently cancelled the blocksize upgrade - it wasn't Blockstream or any Core developers who did that. Had they been successful in implementing the blocksize update and getting the majority hashpower, market cap, users, exchanges and other businesses to follow them then the NYA backers would have had control of the code and a legitimate claim to the Bitcoin name and BTC ticker. The NYA backers severely overestimated, and oversold, the support they claimed for segwit2x. It was ultimately cancelled by a letter signed by 6 people.

You falsely imply that miners put politics above profit, or that politics is the only factor when deciding which pool to mine with.

Just to provide a counter example: When 95% of mining pools agreed on NYA, did you see any evidence of a mass exodus of miners or hashpower from those pools who signed the NYA?

They get it from their feelings, so don't expect for answer based on facts.

It's already plenty enough for them to declare this conspiracy theory true *in their opinion* though. They came up with the theory in the first place so the chance of it being real *in their opinion* was already quite high *in their opinion*. But now add a completely unmonitored/unregulated poll on Twitter presumably confirming it and it's a wrap... *in their opinion*.

The most hilarious part is that few days ago the same people were claiming (without any proof obviously) that Twitter as a platform was (also) compromised and should not be used because Jack Dorsey was supposedly involved in the fact that @bitcoin stopped acting as the marketing representative of bitcoin\.com. Yes, another conspiracy theory, there might be a pattern here if you pay attention... but now let's all completely forget this, this Twitter poll is very helpful and insightful.

The thing with unsubstantiated bullshit is that you can invent as much of it as you want, but the risk of overlap between your conspiracy theories becomes quite high and contradictions become very common... and this is a perfect example of this."

Most of the Latin American population also has some Caucasian ancestry. Along with India, the Middle East, North Africa, South Africa, Northern Asia, etc.

Also, the only reason why there are so many more Females than males, is because of historical chivalry. Men take the rougher jobs, so account for more than 80% of workplace deaths. Traditionally only men fought in was, so more of them die in conflict. Men also account for more suicides than women.

An unknown node client version is used in 23% of BTC blocks but core client dominance is still shown as having 96,6% dominance.

This means that the pie of the node client dominance does NOT necessarily reflect the situation of the node client versions that miners are running. Because 23% of BTCs hash rate is obviously mining using another client (or are masking which client they are running) that might not even be represented in the pie chart.

If it turns out that that hash rate is using a different btc node implementation, it means that the argumentation that support for the core devs is reflected in the node distribution is invalid."

That's been the main point behind why UASF was a fake indicator of support for anything. Anyone can spin up hundreds of nodes in docker on AWS with some VPN's/proxies to spoof support, because cost is near 0.

900,"there are more coinjoin tx on btc than bcash, so theres that..."
901,"I think you mean, not being done."
902,and yet fees are so high
903,can you highlight which of these are completed and working as intended in the last 11 years?
904,nothing has improved to the BTC protocol since segwit.
905,Also the entire Lightning Network branch can be pruned. LN is a dumpster fire.
906,But you need immutability for things like VeriBlock. A 2nd layer is not a solution.
907,using that definition exchanges should also be put under sidechains
908,"> technology stack

or pretty picture."
909,I guess I need to look for BTC's progress ugh lol
910,"While that's true, I think we need to be a little careful not to claim that research and stuff that's in development, as well as stuff that's built on top of a protocol (think CashShuffle, CashFusion) doesn't count as progress.

It will be a lot of work to assess the real state of progress on BTC - the article as far as I saw didn't attempt to really go far into it.

On the other hand, I think we are much more familiar with the progress on BCH, since there has been a lot and we are actually using it. Even protocol stuff like Schnorr."
911,"Yea, but it sure pads this graphic of vaporware and stalled projects doesn't it?"
912,"Why do you consider an exchange to be a *Current area of development on Bitcoin*?

An exchange isn't a protocol."
913,It’s right next to the thousand angels dancing on the head of a needle.
914,Good luck with that : )
915,"> An exchange isn't a protocol.

either are many of the things in that image"
916,Such as?
917,"- did LN fix the issue where you have to be online to receive funds?

- did LN fix the issue that if you go offline you can lose your funds?

- did LN fix the routing issue where if you try to spend but it fails most of the time?

- did LN fix the issue that in order to receive funds, you must have first spent at least that amount?

- did LN fix the dozen other issues that plagues it?"
918,Which currency do you think the Lightning Banks will use most when you have atomic swaps on the Lightning Notwork?
919,"> Notwork

920,Isn't this just going to make block time variance worse?
921,"It is currently
0.90%
more profitable
to mine on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

922,"Not really since just 2,8% of BCH miners are from Poolin. Its mostly annoying for Bitcoin since it's difficulty won't adjust as fast to switching miners."
923,"It is currently...

7.60%
more profitable

to mine on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain."
924,Thanks for the info! What about that rumour that some of the unknown hash on BCH was from Poolin?
925,"You mean the hash rate spikes a couple of days ago that made some concerned that someone is tricking the difficulty adjustment again?
No idea, unless the miner goes public saying ""hey it was me"" or leaving info about him in the block header, there is no way of knowing. And that's how it's supposed to be by the way ;)"
926,"So disappointed with Jesse and Kraken. They’ve gone full maxi now, even pushing these stupid HODL videos."
927,Personally I’m happy for the new “stacking sats” term as it indicates exactly who I should unfollow or not follow on twitter.  It’s a great litmus of honesty and intelligence.
928,Good for newbies I guess. Learning some terminology never hurts.
929,Jesse has to please both sides. We can’t expect him to come out anti SOV since the majority of people who came into crypto in the last 3 years were completely gaslighted by btc propaganda. As we see with Bosak poll and sentiments ... people will eventually come around.
930,"> They’ve gone full maxi now

I don't think it's that simple. Kraken were very useful splitting coins right after the fork and I bet there's a lot Jesse isn't saying."
931,"I'm also deeply concerned by their new maximalist stance. They were so Bitcoin Cash friendly before, but now it is different. I'm very scared that something very bad is happening."
932,"Kraken accepts Tether/USDT, that's all you need to know."
933,"Well, they’ve made some highly suspect hires like Dan Held and Pierre Rochard. They promote and pay Peter McCormack. They make these ridiculous videos. Yes they were helpful post-fork, but I don’t see them doing anything but harm for the past year or so."
934,"> Well, they’ve made some highly suspect hires like Dan Held and Pierre Rochard. They promote and pay Peter McCormack.

I wasn't aware of that :("
935,Maybe that's the price you have to pay for having your own differentiated opinion and still not being attacked and boycotted by the bitcoiner maxi hodl crowd
936,"You could have posted the 3 links. The newest one is December 1st 2017. In crypto time that is ages ago. A lot has happened with both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash since December 1st 2017.

Not sure what your point is. These are still my top 3 links for anyone curious about what the deal is with Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash. And people probably won't be writing about this stuff much anymore, so the best sources on the ""scaling debate"" and takeover aren't likely to change. (And that's a good thing, probably. What there is to say about all that has been said, no need to say it again. But definitely worth sharing with people who never heard the full story in the first place.)"

944,What? xD
945,"No. They're marketing it as such to try and siphon some interest away from BCH, it's deliberate."
946,"Yeah, it really captures the hopelessness of someone who tried to fight the blatant takeover as it happened."
