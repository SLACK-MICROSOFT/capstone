"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)",This is why I think an explosion is just ahead: [https://i.imgur.com/3ozEvNF.png](https://i.imgur.com/3ozEvNF.png) My guess is Bitcoin will breka up when with the tightening of the 3D bbands which should happen in 2-8 days from here. We might see a earlier breakout from the falling wedge but remain first in the 3D bband zone and have then the BGD right afterwards. Wondering what will happen with the Alt ratios then... :)
"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)","Then, the Earth was no longer recognizable, and Chimera was born. A radioactive wasteland, almost empty except for the super-structures extending towards the heavens - the Citadels. 33 were created, but only 9 remained fully functional and protected. The underrail system was flawless, but its perfection became a security issue, and the remaining Citadels had to isolate themselves. The year was 2021.. the Mayans were right - we fucked up the math and thought it was mythology.."

I posted the issues Chainlink is facing in the previous daily but thought i'd share it here as well. If you hold this coin it looks like it could be the next bitconnect. Turns out their having server problems, which is a serious concern. How can enterprises trust a company that cannot even keep their product online when it has so few users. Also the fact the team never thought to back up Chainlink on a cloud like google shows they are very stupid.Link: [https://blog.chain.link/weapologize](https://blog.chain.link/weapologize)"

"Daily Discussion - November 17, 2019 (GMT+0)",I am absolutely stunned with the Brave browser. After maybe 3-4 months of using it I know have forgotten what ads are. There are only a couple of websites I need to disable the ad blocker for them to work. The rest work seamless with the blocker. And I have received 125 BAT from just browsing the internet as I normally do. Incredible. I was able to withdraw these funds today and put them into a Binance wallet. I cant believe how amazing this technology is and how we are getting rewarded for doing what we normally do without the pain of ads. Just amazing technology and something everyone should be using IMO.

XRP lawsuit with Jed McCaleb enters 6th year allowing 750m XRP to be sold every year Increasing to 1 billion in 2020 and 2 billion in 2021,Since I'm not following XRP that muchCan anyone explain me the logic behind this story and give some more context?
XRP lawsuit with Jed McCaleb enters 6th year allowing 750m XRP to be sold every year Increasing to 1 billion in 2020 and 2 billion in 2021,If you need rules that stop him from dumping tol fast it must be a great coin to invest in. And the best part: in the small print it even says that xrp has NOTHING to do with ripple.
XRP lawsuit with Jed McCaleb enters 6th year allowing 750m XRP to be sold every year Increasing to 1 billion in 2020 and 2 billion in 2021,I wonder what exchange he dumps them on.
XRP lawsuit with Jed McCaleb enters 6th year allowing 750m XRP to be sold every year Increasing to 1 billion in 2020 and 2 billion in 2021,XRP is a total joke. Even worse than any central bank in existence. He's basically printing a few hundred million dollars for himself in the course of a few years.

(some other projects too). NO utility equals death,  BTC has turned into a cult , the concept  is extraordinary, but the tech is crap, just like the crap tech of ETH, LTC, all PoW projects have no future.Many in the XRPCommunity know what they are into,  the FUD & haters keep us motivated to hodl and focus on the end goal. Keep jibbering while I take another bite of my cookie  and buy some more zerps on Bitrue."
XRP lawsuit with Jed McCaleb enters 6th year allowing 750m XRP to be sold every year Increasing to 1 billion in 2020 and 2 billion in 2021,Here's a more complete context to the story that says Jed can only dump 0.75% of the daily XRP volume each day. https://www.ccn.com/ripple-expat-jed-mccaleb-ramps-up-cryptocurrency-sell-off-as-xrp-rallies/750m XRP/year sounds bad but when you look at the new agreement it's not something that will do much to the price. There's a hard limit to what Jed can dump on a daily basis. Without proper context this is inaccurate FUD.

What's the best way to get the most leverage (with no collateral) to put everything in cryptocurrency and then subsequently fuck off and declare bankruptcy?,WSB Crypto Edition. Nice.Not sure theres enough Autism in this sub to bring any value to your question. Good luck though!
What's the best way to get the most leverage (with no collateral) to put everything in cryptocurrency and then subsequently fuck off and declare bankruptcy?,"In no way do I endorse this, but here would be the best way to do it.- take out personal loans with your banks (since you have zero collateral, you have to have someone that trusts you enough to actually give you  loan).- take them out in smaller amounts, not just one big purchase. For instance if your max is 50k, maybe do 5 payments of 10k. Take them out in cash.- mix the cash into foreign currencies. Definitely not locally, preferably with a shady dealer somewhere that you bus to. Let's say each installment, you mix it into 2k into 5 currencies, euros, norweigan kroner, czech koruna, ukranian hyrivnia and British pound.- fly over to somewhere that isnt related to any of those currencies. Let's say Egypt.- bus into a country that takes each of the currencies you have taken out. No planes, no identification. You want to leave no trail.- convert that money directly into a bitcoin atm. All of them take local cash. You will pay a fee but you will not be tracked in any way.- send your bitcoin to 5 separate wallets. Have these set up beforehand on a computer not related to you or any of your networks that you've used before. Preferably not in your home state or country as well.- mix these bitcoin into Monero.- after exceeding your limit and after a period of time where your bank is asking for loan repayment, reveal that you are indeed a conniving douchebag and declare bankruptcy.- live the rest of your life being hounded by the bank who trusted you to pay back money that you borrowed, but secure on the fact you have a giant pile of monero.Alternatively, you could simply leave your country and live somewhere else, given you have a giant pile of cryptocurrency. Ditch your phone, your reputation and everyone you know and love, because you cant ever speak to any of them again without it being tracked and you being extradited.Good luck. Enjoy your pile of illicit gains!"

What's the best way to get the most leverage (with no collateral) to put everything in cryptocurrency and then subsequently fuck off and declare bankruptcy?,I figure you could apply for as many credits cards as possible and combine those with a line of credit and some personal loans. Where I am this could probably net about 100k (10 credits cards at $5k each + $25k line of credit + $25k personal loans).

What's the best way to get the most leverage (with no collateral) to put everything in cryptocurrency and then subsequently fuck off and declare bankruptcy?,"Key point is to look at your country’s bankruptcy laws. Eg do you have to declare assets, how you lost the money, eg gambling with cash ;) and also how long after bankruptcy any windfalls can be claimed by your creditors. Obviously you’ve got all the terrible idea advice already but if you are going all in, consider doing it to a level you can still win big but could afford to pay the loans/interest for a while. Then if it did “moon” you could pay off loans too without any extra shady ness."

And then if any step fails, I'll change it to edit out that step, but in theory it means I will keep being able to stack up the dividends and increase the future dividends"
What's your investment strategy?,Buy when I can then forget about it.
What's your investment strategy?,"Trading is not, in general, a good idea. You lose money on every trade, and if you're in the USA it's worse on your taxes if you do wind up making a profit.Find something that actually has value and sound economics, and treat it like a regular investment. Better yet, also buy something that you actually want to use."
What's your investment strategy?,Keep accumulating.Accumulate more when the price dips.
What's your investment strategy?,I’m not super diversified atm.. but I’m also 100% fine with the risk. Right now i’m in on alts.. I’m hoping for a spike in which I’ll probably dump for btc..we’ll see. Haha I think the most important thing is to not get emotional.. don’t get FOMO.. good way to lose money. I always buy in the dips and sell into the hype. Sometimes I’ll try to get out early on some things if I think it’s a long term drop.. most recently have dumped all my XRP due to that.
What's your investment strategy?,"Crypto should only be a portion of your overall portfolio. You want to diversify into different assets as well. While diversification is a key component in the traditional perspective, in crypto its probably not the best idea. I would stick with the majority of your crypto portfolio in BTC with a smaller portion in alts. 75- 80% BTC, 20-25% alts. Do your research and stick to the alt coins that have strong fundamentals and positive growth and development in the ecosystem. Planning on converting to different coins because they loose value is not the best decision IMO. Crypto is very volatile and even the best projects will gain and lose significant value, its best to stick to the alts that you see long term potential in and just ride out the volatility."
