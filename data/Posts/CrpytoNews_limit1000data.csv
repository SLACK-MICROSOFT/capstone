Every partner is evaluated according to the performance dimensions of the platform, and only the top 50% of partners can enjoy the most lucrative returns. The rest 50% of partners will be considered as non-partners and their profits will be greatly reduced, but the platform will also guarantee their initial original capital of investment.

87,Why do 51% attacks happen and what are they?,1,dznxio,CryptoNews,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoNews/comments/dznxio/why_do_51_attacks_happen_and_what_are_they/,0,"Before we dive into this topic, one should understand the basics of Blockchain technology. A well-distributed blockchain consists of thousands of different nodes that individually support the network‚Äôs decentralization and security. These nodes are by itself supported by miners, basically computers who use their processing power to solve mathematical equations. All these nodes and mining computers are connected and together make up for a distributed datacenter we know as a blockchain. The way of reaching consensus about the given rules within the protocol varies per blockchain. The oldest and most commonly used version is the Proof-Of-Work blockchain, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Given the fact thousands of people and institutions around the world support these networks, it‚Äôs hard to breach the security. In theory, it is possible, however.

**What is a 51% attack?**  
A blockchain is hard to hack into, it‚Äôs not as simple to crack as a regular database that usually hides behind admin access gained with a couple passwords. In order to breach a blockchain, you‚Äôd have to perform a 51% attack. This simply means that you would have to gain access over more than 50% hashrate of the network, thus 51% attack. Hashrate is another word for mining power. The moment one sole entity is in charge of more than half of the network, this party can now change its consensus protocol. By doing so, you could reverse the blockchain years back in time causing many transactions to never have occurred, allow more Bitcoin to be created or destroy parts of the entire supply. This means you could cause chaos. The chances of a 51% attack are not that high, but in history, it has happened before.

***Ethereum Classic***  
One of the most famous 51% attacks was on the original Ethereum protocol, Ethereum Classic. After a major hack in the early days of the Ethereum network, the team we now know responsible for Ethereum took control of the network and reversed the attack. To frustration of the core team of Ethereum, that went on to build further on Ethereum Classic, the version that was never forked or whatsoever. Having a smaller market cap would make it less expensive for a single entity to take control of the network and that is what happened. $1.1 million in ETC was double spent during the attack, causing many major exchanges to halt the trading of the coin. Prices went down but eventually recovered and the hackers eventually got away with it.

***Verge***  
This project has suffered multiple attacks over the years. After claiming to be the number one privacy coin, the project called for many haters to come to their front doors. Back in 2018 however, Verge suffered from more than one attack. It started with a hacker found a way of integrating malicious software into the mining protocol. With their new version of the protocol, they could mine multiple blocks per minute on the verge blockchain, gaining them control over network hashrates and move XVG to their wallets. At the peak of the second attack, the hackers were mining 25 blocks per minute, or roughly 8250 XVG or $950 every single minute. Reports say over $1.7 million in XVG was stolen in the three attacks. The team behind Verge called it nothing but a DDoS attack. Afterward, a hard fork occurred and now a multi-algorithm style of mining is utilized to minimize the probability of another 51% attack.

**How can it happen?**  
You might be wondering, how is this possible? You plug in thousands of mining rigs and there you have it, you just gained control of the network. This, however, is a very expensive operation. Doing this for the Bitcoin blockchain would cost you around 1 Billion dollars, that amount much lower for smaller coins though. Ever heard of Monero? That‚Äôd cost you roughly $25,000 according to calculations by [Exaking](https://www.exaking.com/51). These are theoretical examples, in practice, many of these projects have built-in warning signs and detectors to go against these kinds of attacks. It is, however, important to be aware of this possibility. You can not just blindly trust any blockchain out there to be a hundred percent safe.

But during the discussion, it was also said about how difficult it is to determine the value for blockchain-based projects. So Sunny Lu said that 99% of the token‚Äôs value is pure speculation and does not directly depend on the real value that the use of the blockchain in the project can bring. Startups, which originally was focussed on one goal, often spend a lot of time, effort and finance on the production, implementation and sale of the token, departing from the initial tasks.

186,What are the biggest memes in the crypto industry and where do they come from?,1,dvwkkg,CryptoNews,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoNews/comments/dvwkkg/what_are_the_biggest_memes_in_the_crypto_industry/,0,"Bitcoin is a product of the internet. It was launched back in the day through a newsletter for cryptographic experts and later on, the source code was shared online. The technology behind Bitcoin, plus nowadays any cryptocurrency out there, can not exist without the internet. A stable connection is necessary in order to keep the network alive. This strong affiliation with the internet has not only brought great scaling opportunities, it has, since then turned into a widely discussed topic. As loads of people like to do when discussing topics on the internet, crypto has been the source of many new memes out there. 

**When Moon? When Lambo?**

These are two commonly used phrases both referring to the price of the token. The phrase ‚ÄòTo the moon‚Äô came from prices suddenly spiking with hundreds of percentages causing people to draw rockets on the charts. These rockets should be leading them towards the moon, thus the phrase, when moon? It suits perfectly in combination with the phrase ‚ÄòWhen Lambo‚Äô, which was invented when the first crypto millionaires came around the corner. They started buying Lamborghinis with their earned wealth from investing in cryptocurrencies and people started seeing it as a means of measuring the success of a coin. 

**HODL**

This is a simple world that leads back all the way to 2013. Back then, market crashes were caused by as ‚Äòlittle‚Äô as one million dollars. Prices went up and down like a rollercoaster, just like we‚Äôve seen in 2017. With everyone that sells their tokens at the top of the charts, there are others who buy for these prices. The moment the prices drop, there are two options; You sell your tokens for a loss or you hold your tokens. A user on a Bitcoin forum posted a typo after a severe crash back in 2013 stating; ‚ÄúI AM HODLING‚Äù. This was then embraced by everyone in the industry and is now seen as one of the most used slang words in crypto.

**Doge**

This is the cutest of them all, doge. It‚Äôs the little dog that‚Äôs been visible in memes over the course of many, many years now. As a popular meme for years, some programmers decided to roll with it and create a ‚Äòfun‚Äô cryptocurrency. They took the Shiba Inu dog and took it as the symbol for their token. It has been steadily present in the industry for many years now, with a steady position in terms of market cap. But remember, 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE.

**Pink Wojak**

Anyone that knows their memes must have hard about the Wojak figure before. It‚Äôs that guy that‚Äôs incredibly frustrated with life, in this case, frustrated with crypto. It‚Äôs related to those who have invested in cryptocurrency heavily and foresee a crash coming in the near future. It was posted on 4Chan‚Äôs board /biz/ to display the despair caused by the price that had been dropping. Over the following months, many varieties of the Wojak-man were created. One thing they have in common; they are all pink.

**Altcoin season approaching**

We used to have just a couple of currencies out there, that has changed. Right now, there are over 3000 coins listed on CoinMarketCap but assumingly there are many more projects that label themselves as a cryptocurrency. With every new project, there are new investors that hope their project gets picked up and finds the eye of many potential investors. They want a new season to start, altseason. With every spike in Bitcoin, we see people screaming for altseason. There are tons of different memes out there created to display the people who sadly waiting for altseason to arrive. Whenever it does, we can see the ‚Äòwhen Lambos‚Äô coming up.

Memes are a good indicator of what‚Äôs trending in the industry. There are loads of people creating new memes every single day, but the moment you see the same meme every single day, there could be a trend starting. When everybody‚Äôs screaming for altseason, it might just be around the corner. Whether we‚Äôll all be on the moon, we‚Äôll drive a Lambo or we are stuck HODLING our coins, only time will tell.",1573701051.0

Are we going to have alt season this month or it is never going to happen? These questions and many more run through the minds of crypto traders. We all are looking out for alt season without taking cognizance of the fact that some altcoins have had their alt season. Some have gone 10X from their all-time lows while others are gearing up for a move. For me, I have picked up my bags of #Chromia and my choice is based on fundamental analyses which we all know never fails. 

\#Chromia's mainnet is fast approaching and we all know there will be a surge in price based on this new. Not only is the mainnet approaching, Mines of Darnia games; the most anticipated game in the gaming industry is set to launch on Chromia's blockchain. To top it all, Chromia recently signed a deal with the Inter- American Bank to deploy Land Registry and lending in South American. All of these Fundamental analyses and more will be a good price propellant.

This was via transaction Hash: 06731059c552ba98a3ca9d514be2a553fd95a64242e4d0171067a5d9314c049b

However, immediately after the deposit of the 0.0195BTC, someone at Coinrate withdrew it immediately at exactly¬†9.10pm the same¬†day.This was via  txid:¬†4eccd7d4cdb5f4f173a221f97fba3711bfba2caa6b167f0a7ac3691fbcc2ac50

You can see the history of my CoinRate BTC address here: (Taken from Blockchain Explorer) [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/4eccd7d4cdb5f4f173a221f97fba3711bfba2caa6b167f0a7ac3691fbcc2ac50](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/4eccd7d4cdb5f4f173a221f97fba3711bfba2caa6b167f0a7ac3691fbcc2ac50)¬†

What is mysterious is that the Transaction History of BOTH the deposit and withdrawal are missing from my CoinRate account  since CoinRate erased them!

I have written to CoinRate severally through the support email and and upto today CoinRate has not responded nor refunded my BTC.¬†

I have all the screenshots.

Any person that has been doing some research on cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, probably has heard of this name before. Satoshi Nakamoto. Who is this mysterious man and why does no one know who he is? This goes back to October 2008, when an unknown user by the name of Nakamoto sent out the whitepaper for Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System to a cryptographic newsletter. After the announcement had been done and the manifesto describing the revolution Nakamoto was aiming to start, in January the software was released. He was the person to mine the Genesis block encrypted with the headline of the New York Times of that day. Nakamoto has stopped using his Bitcoin since mid-January 2009, with nowadays having Bitcoin that is worth over 19 Billion dollars. Unclear is to say if Nakamoto still has access to these coins. If so, he could just be the 44th richest person in the world. The problem is, nobody knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is. Besides a couple of posts on the forums about Bitcoin, there has been no personal messages or activities shared by Nakamoto.

## Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

There are many different stories including many different answers to these questions. Let‚Äôs have a look at some of the most known speculations out there and see why they might be or might not be Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin.

***Hal Finney***  
This man was one of the pioneers in the field of cryptography prior to Bitcoin being created. Back in 2009, Finney was the first person to ever do a Bitcoin transaction and besides Nakamoto himself, he was the only person to use the software. Many analysts have compared Finney‚Äôs writing to the published work of Nakamoto and found many similar techniques and styles. Years later, Finney denied all the claims as he showed correspondence between him and Nakamoto pointing at someone else being Nakamoto. Finney has died in 2014 and his family chose to freeze his body.

***Dorian Nakamoto***  
This man is the only person who actually has the same name. Dorian Nakamoto has the birth name ‚ÄòSatoshi Nakamoto‚Äô, but this is not the only evidence. An article published in Newsweek showed an interview with Dorian confirming his affiliation with Bitcoin and confirming being the founder. The following interview, however, implicated Dorian had never heard of any virtual currency named Bitcoin nor does he have had anything to do with it. After the interview, the account used by Satoshi five years ago weirdly posted ‚ÄòI am not Dorian Nakamoto‚Äô. Whether this was the real Satoshi or a hacker, is unclear.

***Craight Wright***  
Probably the most known example is ‚ÄòFaketoshi‚Äô, better known as Craight Wright. Anyone that has known Bitcoin for a while knows it‚Äôs decentralized and the power is that no one is in charge. Anyone associated with Bitcoin confirms the identity of Nakamoto has to remain anonymous, except for Craig Wright. Ever since 2015, Wright has been claiming to be the inventor of Bitcoin. The fact that he has been affiliated with the project for years is clear, but being the inventor is false as confirmed by many Bitcoin pioneers. A couple weeks ago, the court has officially stated Craight Wright could not prove to be the inventor of Bitcoin.

In reality, nobody knows the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. The only way to confirm this is bringing all the old accounts back to live, moving the coins in the wallet that has been idle since 2009 and confirming the identity. This can be tough, Nakamoto might not even be alive nowadays. The beauty is, he does not have to be alive for Bitcoin to survive!

295,"The ‚ÄòBitcoin Rich List‚Äô Has Grown 30% in the Last Year, But Why?",1,drwoev,CryptoNews,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoNews/comments/drwoev/the_bitcoin_rich_list_has_grown_30_in_the_last/,0," The Bitcoin Rich List, or the number of addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC, has swelled in the past 12 months, possibly reflecting an influx of high-net-worth investors.¬†¬†

The metric has registered growth of 30 percent since September 2018, according to [Coin Metrics](https://coinmetrics.io/charts/) data. Even when adjusted to exclude addresses known to belong to exchanges, the figure shows a similar surge.

At press time, 2,148 addresses contain more than 1,000 bitcoins, amounting to just 0.01 percent of all bitcoin addresses, as per BitInfoCharts‚Äô [Bitcoin Rich List](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html).

Note that BTC fell from $6,400 to $3,100 in the final quarter of 2018 and experienced investors may have taken advantage of the price dip to snap up the top cryptocurrency on the cheap, leading to the rise in the addresses with more than 1,000 bitcoins.¬†

Other observers, however, are not convinced that the number of individuals with 1,000+ BTCs has increased.

After all, an individual can move 50,000 bitcoins from a single wallet to 50 different wallets for custody purposes.¬†Also, a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance holds bitcoins belonging to millions of users and can store coins in different wallets.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mostly the exchanges ‚Ä¶ both the amount of BTC held in exchanges and the number of exchanges/custodians have been growing,‚Äù trader Alex Kruger told CoinDesk.¬†

He noted that on-chain transaction volume in BTC terms has been relatively flat since September 2018 ‚Äì a sign the rich list is possibly increasing due to exchanges, which tend to have low on-chain transaction frequency. For instance, [top addresses](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html) have fewer withdrawals compared to deposits and could, therefore, be exchanges‚Äô cold, or offline wallets.¬†

While trading volume is the lifeblood of exchanges, it is not necessarily reflected on-chain, since these companies may internally debit or credit client addresses without executing a transaction on the public ledger.¬†

That said, it is not possible to know for sure whether a given address with infrequent transactions is an exchange or a whale.

Further, as shown in the chart below, if you take out known exchange addresses, the rich list still grew by almost 30 percent over the 12-month period, to more than 2,100¬†addresses, pretty much the same rate as for all addresses.

This supports Woo‚Äôs interpretation that the influx of high-net-worth individuals was a primary reason for the rise in addresses with more than 1,000 bitcoins.

One more possible reason for the rise could be the distribution of ownership over time, according to [Qiao Wang](https://twitter.com/QWQiao), director of product at crypto data source Messari.

‚ÄúIn the beginning it was Satoshi, then a few early miners, who owned all the bitcoin. But over time their share decreased and other people entered the market,‚Äù¬†Wang said.

Looking forward, both wealthy investors and exchanges may continue to drive the rise in the number of ‚Äúrich‚Äù addresses. With the next mining reward halving ‚Äì a historically¬†[price-bullish](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-may-see-november-price-boost-with-halving-due-in-six-months) event ‚Äì due in six months, new investors may enter the market.¬†

Also, trading volumes at the Bakkt bitcoin futures exchange, which needs to store bitcoin for its physically delivered futures, are increasing. Recently, futures volume jumped by more than 250 percent to $11 million. The exchange, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, is set to [launch](https://www.coindesk.com/bakkt-to-launch-options-on-its-bitcoin-futures-dec-9) options on futures on Dec. 8.",1572973599.0

324,THE CORE ELEMENTS OF THE EZ365 ECOSYSTEM,1,dq9vjt,CryptoNews,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoNews/comments/dq9vjt/the_core_elements_of_the_ez365_ecosystem/,0,"üì∑  
INTRODUCTION  
The EZ365 ecosystem is one that aims to improve customer‚Äôs experience concerning online gaming and digital asset trading. EZ365 overcomes the barriers in digital assets systems by providing customer support, security, and ease of use. In extension, EZ365 would create a secure environment to play, trade and learn. For this reason, the EZ365 constitutes three primary core elements.  
**HERE ARE THE THREE COMPONENTS**.  
‚Ä¢ **Online Gaming (iGaming)**: The gaming industry is growing by each year, and as of 2017, the generated revenue was about $120 billion. This growth also applies to the betting market and online gaming, with revenues of over $45.8 billion. These two are expected to rise to $94.4 billion in 2024. Also, close to 51% of the world‚Äôs population participate in some form of gaming annually. These statistics show the viability of the market. EZ365 has a subsystem called the EZ Win; an online blockchain-based gaming platform. EZ Win offers services like casino games, sports, and e-sports betting. EZ Win is unlike anything currently existing in the gaming industry. Most online casinos work on software and users are to trust that the games have not been programmed to lower the odds of winning. With the introduction of the blockchain technology, this uncertainty will become a thing of the past. The EZ Win is public and immutable in nature. Statistics around Wins, losses, payouts are available to the public. EZ Win utilizes the blockchain to record this information. EZ Win offers a wide range of games, sports and e-sports betting. EZ Win has an efficient marketing strategy consisting of several programs to engage targeted audiences.  
‚Ä¢ **EZ Exchange**: EZ Exchange is a platform that improves the mass adoption of digital assets by providing superior customer experience. It provides adequate support and topnotch security when trading digital assets. EZ Exchange delivers a fast response to issues like account suspension, authentication issues etc. It takes customer support to new heights to meet the user‚Äôs demand. EZ Exchange offers different options from which both beginners and experts can choose from. EZ Exchange has two different trading interfaces which are EZ Exchange Easy and EZ Exchange Advanced. The platform offers its features in English, Russian, Korean, Chinese and Japanese. In EZ Exchange, users can fund trading accounts and withdraw fiat money through credit cards. In EZ Exchange, there are two payment models: Pay-per-trade and Subscription-based trading.  


‚Ä¢ **EZ Academy**: It is a whole institution about higher digital assets learning. EZ Academy covers several topics bordering on the blockchain and digital currency. The EZ Academy provides trading strategies instructions to stimulate blockchain innovation. The academy revolves around three offerings: Training and Development portal, community portal and a VIP club. All of these offerings provide useful resources, interaction and access to premium features.  


       CONCLUSION 

The EZ365 ecosystem is gradually changing the system of digital asset trading and online gaming. It provides users with favourable winning odds, trading knowledge and unique features. EZ365 puts the traders and customers first with active core elements like EZ Win, EZ Exchange and the EZ Academy.

**INTRODUCING BLOCKCHAIN AND PNGME**

Blockchain technology is finding increasing uses in various platforms of the world today, till date it keeps growing while disrupting many platforms, systems etc. One wonderful thing about blockchain technology is that it can either be leveraged on to build a new platform or can be utilized to improve an already existing platform or industry. 

This feat about blockchain might sound like rocket science but it's true; the proof can be seen in its various features such as decentralization which ensure transparency and trust, use of smart contracts which ensure the adequate agreement is adhered to as well as other features. 

With the idea of decentralization, imagine channelling the thought to the financial systems, the impossible will be achieved; this is the idea that a platform known as Pngme banked on thus developing its platform.  
 For better understanding, we all know the irregularities within the current financial institutions, such as lack of access to loans which has gone a long way in trapping or limiting many businesses from growing, in the long run, having a negative effect on the economy of scale.

percentage yield (APY). The staking facility will not be available to users until until Q1 2020 and
will be operated by Andromeda Technologies Ltd and will be available on Pngme. The rate of
interest paid decreases by 10% annually from 30% (starting in Q1 2020) until the interest rate
reaches a flat rate of 2% or until all Pngcoin allocated for stakers are claimed - this rate is set for every user irrespective of the size of their stake but the rate varies based on the length of time
Pngcoin is staked for and is weighted to be higher for longer-term saving.
The interest issuance is capped at 326,837,781 Pngcoin and once all of these tokens have been
issued the network will become deflationary. This reduction of interest takes place over 20
years before flattening at 2% - this is designed to gradually inflate the supply of Pngcoin in line
with user adoption of the Pngme Network.

# What is DeBay ?

üì∑

DeBay is a global platform oriented for cryptocurrency digital assets. DeBay is developed by Hash2One which offers cloud computing power service and BHP Collateralized BTC Dividend service to customers to let them have stable and relatively attractive rate of return. DeBay platform provides cloud computing power services on staking basis. currently, customer can dowload DeBay App and start enjoying daily stable return coming from the following services:

1. Services seen as mining: The services we provide are all staking basis. In other words, customers need to stake a certain amount of fiat (or coins if they already have products‚Äô related coins)to ‚Äúmine‚Äù relevant coins via either POW (Proof-of-Work) or POS (Proof-of-Stake). For instance, customers can mine bitcoins by using either cloud computing power service (POW) or BHP Collateralized BTC Dividend service (POS).
2. Services seen as a B2C business model: Hash2One is the platform which delievers those services to end customers. Moreover, all the services guarantee either investment principal or coins initially staked. Therefore, it‚Äôs more like value-added services. However, customers need to make staking on Hash2One to use its services.

\* At product maturity, customers have choice between refund staked amount + daily bitcoin benefits or renew staking contract to continue enjoying daily mined bitcoin units.

Because it‚Äôs likely that a sizable portion of your customer base uses an iPhone, Apple‚Äôs voice-activated search feature, personified as Siri, should be one of your best friends. So how can you make sure Siri notices you?

If you‚Äôre assuming that Siri gets her search results from Google, a quick comparison will show you that‚Äôs a bad assumption‚Äîin fact, Siri now defaults to Bing. To further complicate matters, mobile search results in general, are inherently different from the search engine results you get on your laptop‚Äîeven within the same search engine‚Äôs realm. But rest assured, Siri has her own search algorithm.

***Siri SEO Tips***

1. Make sure your site works: Use responsive design or a mobile URL to ensure users see your site as you‚Äôd like and can find what they need most with mobile-friendly navigation.
2. Use mobile keywords, including local terms: Mobile searchers often search by city and ZIP code. Also, use common questions mobile users might ‚Äúask‚Äù as SEO/search terms within some of your content. Spoken search queries tend to be actual questions.
3. Test and maximize site speed: Mobile users have even less time and shorter attention spans than other online searchers.
4. Maintain your social media presence: Maintain relevancy on all major channels as Siri is influenced by social activity and trends.",1569957134.0

766,What are AML/KYC for?,1,d96fk2,CryptoNews,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoNews/comments/d96fk2/what_are_amlkyc_for/,0,"The modern world is increasingly striving to remove anonymity from cryptocurrency circulation.

Client identification is a big problem for blockchain companies today.

The KYC / AML rules, offering their solution to the problem of identification, ensure the acceptance of cryptocurrencies in society, but on the other hand, they cause a conflict between users and regulators. SwapSpace explains what the contradiction consists of, what the terms are themselves, how to pass verification on the exchange with KYC / AML requirements and what exchangers stay anonymous.

**Know your customer, (KYC)** is a term of banking and exchange regulation for financial institutions and bookmakers, as well as other companies working with private money, which means that they must identify the counterparty before conducting a transaction.

Such practice prevents money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion.

The KYC implementation led to the gradual prohibition of servicing anonymous bank accounts.

KYC procedures are created to help financial institutions better verify their customers and monitor transaction risks. Among them, the main ones can be distinguished:

‚Ä¢ customer identification procedures (obtaining passport data, birth certificate, etc.);

‚Ä¢ transaction tracking;

‚Ä¢ risk management (comparison of data on the quantity, the content of transfers, counterparties, material support, etc.).

**Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** is a more extensive term than firstly means anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing and counter-weapons of mass destruction financing. 

The AML process includes:

‚Ä¢ Monitoring of transactions worth more than $10.000;

‚Ä¢ A requirement to report certain types of transactions;

‚Ä¢ Control the movement of coins both abroad and within the country;

‚Ä¢ Obtaining KYC information to confirm a person‚Äôs identity, and to check whether he was involved in illegal activities.

These steps should help identify and seize illegal funds and prevent scam.

**Similarities and differences**

Often the terms are confused or used interchangeably, but it‚Äôs incorrect. 

‚Ä¢ regulatory authorities will use the terms AML, viz. anti-money laundering and terrorist financing;

‚Ä¢ sellers of goods and services often refer to the term ‚ÄúKYC commitment‚Äù.

Customer identification (KYC) is a component of the AML. You can call KYC a set of procedures and tools, a principle in the framework of the general AML policy.

N.B.: the terms KYC and AML are primarily associated with the social responsibility of the business, with protection against fraud risks. Often they are found in contracts of companies from countries where there are legislative restrictions, state control over business entities.

**AML/KYC in the crypto sphere**

Blockchain technology has brought a problem to the financial sector. Most cryptocurrency transactions are made remotely and anonymously. Even though transactions in the traditional system are made open: the appearance and signature of the client can always be compared with the passport data.

The advent of cryptocurrencies has expanded the market for financial instruments and brought the necessity of regulation. At first, cryptocurrency privacy policy was a distinctive feature, however, the necessary of transaction safety led to toughening requirements for personalization of users.

The KYC and AML norms are also the main obstacle to crypto protection, as they contradict one of the fundamental ideas of the blockchain - anonymity. In other words, cryptocurrency transactions must be anonymous and inaccessible for tracking. But since regulators are preoccupied with the problem of cybercrime. That‚Äôs why now the verification requirement on cryptocurrency exchanges is becoming important.

**AML/KYC at SwapSpace**

There are no AML/KYC procedures on SwapSpace itself, we don‚Äôt even have registration. However, we are an aggregator that integrates several swap services, some of them are completely anonymous, but others could ask an ID. We don‚Äôt provide transactions on our own, 

F.e. Changelly uses AML/KYC. ChangeNOW doesn't require your data, but in particular cases, they could ask you to show your ID document scan or some extra information. You may exchange currencies at anonymous registration-free exchangers or choose the safest way if you think so. Our service provides both - just choose the most suitable way to exchange.

896,GAINS Announcements,1,d55itn,CryptoNews,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoNews/comments/d55itn/gains_announcements/,0,"Hello guys, latest and probably last update regarding the vesting for each round.

The round 2 that was fully unlocked is affected similarly to the deal of another big pool that communicated on it today. We got the confirmation yesterday that Hedera has changed the terms on his allocation.
It was 100% unvested (special terms due to early stage assistance) but due to the recent changes to the SAFT's across the board, Hedera has also changed his vesting to weekly over 22 weeks starting on 16th September 2019. The distribution will therefore be weekly for us too.
This change was made unilaterally by Hashgraph and is completely beyond our control, same for the seller. There are legal documents for this change that we asked in order to verify that our legally binding contract with the seller wasn't violated.
Some screenshots can be provided on demand for the sake of transparency.

To sum it up, here are the different vestings:
round 1(April 2018):  No changes: 20% first month and then 10% for the next 8 months
round 2(3 March 2019): weekly vesting over 22 weeks
round 3 (19 March 2019): 25% day1, 25% in a week and 50% vested over 122 days
round 4 (16 June 2019): same as round 3
round 5: (21 June 2019): starts after 4 months (roughly 120 days) until the 12th. If the seller has some tokens left from T2 at that time, he may use his own reserve to decrease our vesting. We won't know before.

We'll let you know if any changes from hh occur before the end of the last distribution. As of now we're still missing some addresses.",1568692003.0
