Should I invest in one or several others?
Which do you consider to be the best wallet?

I recently posted in [https://np.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/e2xt12/your\_thoughts\_on\_a\_company\_using\_stellar\_global/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/e2xt12/your_thoughts_on_a_company_using_stellar_global/)

because a friend had invited me to an introductory meeting with an organisation called Global Technology and Innovation LLC. I have since met with them, and from what I could tell, it is a pyramid scheme that tries to confuse non-techy people into investing into a company with two crypto tokens and where they want members to try to accumulate enough tokens to obtain their 'license' and access to their 'products'.

The company website is [https://gti.ae/](https://gti.ae/)

And you can find more information about the founders here:

FB [https://www.facebook.com/globaltechdubai/](https://www.facebook.com/globaltechdubai/)

Article about their schemes here: [https://behindmlm.com/companies/gti-net-ponzi-confirmed-reboots-as-global-technology-innovation/](https://behindmlm.com/companies/gti-net-ponzi-confirmed-reboots-as-global-technology-innovation/)

The two founders are called Sven Lefeber and Jhony Depresseux. The coins they have created are on the Stellar network but with almost no volume. There are so many layers to their scheme, that I wouldn't know where to begin explaining them here.

What I would like from you lot is any more info that you may have about GTI or their companies. One thing for example that seems strange is that their coins are only tradeable on this exchange [https://bitblinx.com/](https://bitblinx.com/) which apart from a couple of top ten coins, only trades in their ones, GTPLUS and GTFTA. Who runs that exchange for example? It seems their previous ponzi was closed down in Europe and now the company is registered in Dubai, but on their site, they link to other orgs that are based in the Netherlands.

Any info you could dig up would be much appreciated fellow redditors!",1575137705.0

21,Where is the adoption?,4,e3to0l,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/e3to0l/where_is_the_adoption/,38,"Let’s focus on fundamental analysis for a second. The number of wallets with more than 1k worth of bitcoin is still puny and barely growing. Most of it is parked and is not being used for anything. On the other hand, we’re still in a situation where the bigger the polluter of the environment you are, the more rewards you get. Don’t get me wrong. POW is secure but if you really think this asset will have a trillion+ dollar market cap, then you must also believe that trillions of dollars worth of money will be wasted on electricity costs to pollute the environment. If you think that’s sustainable, you’re delusional. Do developers get paid? No. Hence why there hasn’t been much of an incentive to drastically improve the network either. Do people who promote bitcoin get paid? No.

Over the last decade, bitcoin’s price increased exponentially. Why? It’s pretty simple really. It’s a scarce asset and because on the face of it it seemed revolutionary and “new tech” the price was directly correlated to increasing hype and not actual adoption. More hype = increasing price. But hype is based on awareness and once awareness peaks, adoption has to increase for the price to continue up. Hype peaked in December 2017 due to the average person for the first time being aware of bitcoin. And adoption hasn’t changed. If the price relied solely on hype and not adoption, we have already peaked at 20K, and will likely never reach that peak again.",1575134432.0

*Source of this article:* *Sina Finance. This content is intended to convey more market information and does not constitute any investment advice.*

Sina Finance News On November 29, 2019, the ReFinTech Financial Technology Summit was held at Beijing New World Hotel. Li Lihui, the head of the China Mutual Fund Association's blockchain team and former president of the Bank of China, attended and gave a speech. The topic of the speech was ""National Strategy and Fiat Digital Currency.""

Li Lihui said that digital currencies will play a central role in the global digital economy competition in the future, and it is necessary to step up research on feasible routes and implementation plans for the issuance of global digital currencies led by China. Digital finance is bound to further strengthen the globalization of finance. In the construction of the global system of digital finance, China should actively participate in and strive for the right to speak. It is necessary to strengthen international regulatory coordination, promote regulatory consensus, and establish a unified international regulatory standard for digital finance.

&#x200B;

**Blockchain technology architecture**

**Li Lihui pointed out that blockchain is an integrated innovation of multiple technologies and has the following four characteristics.**

>Chain block structure based on timestamp, it is difficult to tamper with the on-chain data;  
Real-time running system based on consensus algorithm, specified data can be shared;  
Based on self-rules of smart contracts, technical trust can be authenticated;  
Based on the end-to-end network of the encryption algorithm, the counterparties can choose each other.

**According to different technical architectures, blockchain can be divided into 3 types.**

**The basic characteristics of the public blockchain architecture are: a decentralized distributed ledger that uses open read, write, and transaction permissions; a decentralized digital trust mechanism that uses consensus algorithms and encryption algorithms; and a virtual currency incentive mechanism that demonstrates work contribution and equity. .**

The technical drawbacks of the public blockchain architecture are high hardware requirements and low transaction speed. If the public blockchain can break through the technical bottleneck of transaction speed and resource utilization efficiency, and achieve publicly recognized reliability, it may be able to expand the territory in social life and modern commerce.

**The characteristic of the private blockchain architecture is that the distributed ledger is centralized, and the read, write, and transaction permissions must be approved by the ""central"" and subject to the constraints and restrictions of the ""central"". The digital trust mechanism of the private chain does not emphasize ""going intermediary"".**

Private blockchain has the ""centralization"" feature of traditional information technology architecture, but uses blockchain technology such as distributed ledger, smart contracts, and encryption algorithms. Blockchain platforms are easy to integrate with existing information technology platforms and can establish bureaus Regional multi-dimensional interaction architecture improves data processing speed and quality.

**Alliance blockchain can generally be regarded as a collection of private blockchains. It adopts a distributed, multi-center, intermediary architecture. Its basic characteristics are open-source, multi-center distributed ledger, limited license, limited authorization. Read, write, and transaction permissions, without emphasis on the digital trust mechanism of intermediaries.**

Different from the traditional big center data architecture, the ""central"" status of the alliance chain may not be designated by the administration, but largely depends on the competitive results of technological advancement and service friendliness; ""trust"" can come from intermediaries and rely on tradition Credit model can also be technical trust without intermediary.

**The characteristics of distributed, end-to-end, open source, and multi-center that the blockchain technology theoretically possesses are likely to restructure the technology architecture in a certain range and rebuild the business model in a certain range.**

First, the distributed architecture and end-to-end network are helpful for the parallel transmission of information, the realization of information sharing, and the parallel control of control. In the scenario of many counterparties, many transaction links, long management chains, and high degree of discreteness, time-space folding And three-dimensional interactive business architecture to improve cooperation efficiency and operation efficiency.

Second, the chain block data structure, consensus mechanism, time stamp, and key technologies can help prevent tampering of the original data, control the risk of data leakage, and protect privacy and data security.

Third, smart contracts help to achieve differentiation and credibility of transaction rules, automate the execution of business processes, ensure the timeliness of transactions, avoid false transactions and repeated transactions, and reduce moral and operational risks to a certain extent.

In the field of finance, the application of the alliance's blockchain technology is likely to build a distributed ledger system in which large, medium and small financial institutions participate together, forming a technical platform for financial institutions to interconnect and interconnect, and to seamlessly link existing systems with innovative systems and realize financial The direct link between the service system and customers enables information sharing, product sharing, and service sharing to provide more efficient financial services.

**The practice of blockchain technology development and application proves that in large-scale commercial applications, the alliance blockchain is most likely to become the mainstream architecture.**

&#x200B;

**Central Bank Legal Digital Currency**

Digital currencies with legal status, endorsement of state sovereignty, and subjects with issuance responsibility constitute legal digital currencies, or central bank digital currencies.

Central banks of many countries have long announced the launch of digital currency research and development. But regarding the basic structure of legal digital currency, countries are still demonstrating and have not yet made a choice.

**The development of China's fiat digital currency lasted for 5 years, and there have recently been signs of preparation for issuance.** **According to the information disclosed by central bank officials, China's legal digital currency may be called DC / EP, Digital Currency / Electronic Payment, that is, digital currency and electronic payment.**

**First, adopt a two-tier operation delivery system to inherit the indirect issuance model.** Applying digital technologies such as blockchain, fiat digital currencies can adopt the ""central bank-public"" direct issue model. In the direct issue model, the central bank can have the absolute power and ability to regulate the money market and can directly absorb public deposits, which will limit the initial credit capacity of commercial banks. If the indirect issuance model of the fiat currency ""Central Bank-Commercial Bank-Public"" is selected, it will inherit the current money market operation mechanism and monetary policy transmission mechanism.

The benefits of inheriting the current model are savings and robustness. First, it is not necessary to rebuild the financial infrastructure, which is conducive to saving investment; second, it is not necessary to restructure the currency issuance and management structure in addition to the old cloth, which is conducive to managing risks; third, it is not necessary to look forward and backward to connect different characteristics of the currency issuance model, which is conducive to stabilizing the market.

**Second, adopt a parallel technical route and adhere to the central bank's central management model.** Based on the judgment that ""the existing blockchain technology cannot meet the high concurrent demand of the retail market in the super market"", fiat digital currencies should remain technologically neutral and do not rely on a single technology. The central bank should adhere to a centralized management model to ensure the reliability of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, the efficiency of currency control, and prevent financial institutions from overspending.

**Third, the ""account loose coupling"" method is adopted to replace the currency M0.** Electronic payment tools such as WeChat Pay and Alipay use the ""tight coupling of accounts"" method. They need to be tied to a bank account and transfer value through the bank account. Under the real-name account management system, the need for anonymous payment cannot be realized. The fiat digital currency may adopt the method of ""account loose coupling"" plus electronic wallet, to achieve end-to-end value transfer from bank accounts, reduce the dependence of financial intermediaries on transaction links, and achieve controllable anonymous payments within the scope permitted by the central bank.

**At present, the design of China's legal digital currency may be limited to replacing M0, that is, cash in circulation, rather than narrow money M1 and broad money M2.** **This depends on the judgment of the digital trends and potential market demand of China's M0, M1, and M2.**

WeChat Pay and Alipay use digital technology to build mobile payment and living service platforms that use trust links as a link, breaking through the traditional payment model, and have achieved 1 billion straight-line links, ranking among the top 2 in global mobile payment platforms. WeChat Pay and Alipay dominated the retail payment market, with cash and ATM transactions significantly reduced, and bank cards became bundled account cards.

**The legal digital currency in China's design can theoretically be separated from the network and from banks to perform value transfer.** **This is different from WeChat Pay and Alipay.** But in the end, whether it can replace traditional currency forms, replace emerging electronic payment tools, and become the main currency form and main payment tool will be decided by the market: it is more convenient to use, the circulation cost is lower, and the public is willing to accept it, thereby forming an economic scale with commercial value .

**Digital Economy National Strategy**

The application of blockchain technology has extended to many fields such as digital finance, the Internet of Things, intelligent manufacturing, supply chain management, and digital asset trading. How to evaluate the current status of blockchain technology and industrial development? My opinion is that the **underlying technology** of the blockchain is **not yet mature, and the technical bottlenecks of large-scale and reliable applications need to be broken. We are in the period of great opportunities for the development of blockchain technology and industrial innovation.**

**First, blockchain technology is still immature and bottlenecks need to be broken.**

In the underlying technology, as a technology integration innovation, the basic components of the blockchain database, P2P peer-to-peer network, and cryptographic algorithms are relatively mature, but they must further meet the new requirements of integrated applications; new mechanisms such as consensus mechanisms and smart contracts Technology needs to be improved. Gartner, a technology consulting company, believes that it will take 5-10 years for blockchain technology to mature.

At present, large-scale applications of blockchain technology have not been implemented in various countries. China's blockchain technology research and development is committed to breaking through the bottleneck of large-scale reliable applications.

The first is private computing technology. Under the blockchain consensus mechanism, how to effectively shield sensitive information, improve signature technology, secure computing technology, encryption technology, trusted execution technology, etc., to ensure data security and digital link reliability.

The second is the authenticity supervision mechanism. How to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data before the on-chain, when the blockchain technology is used to trace the source of various assets, a closed loop is truly formed to avoid information distortion and prevent speculation.

The third is smart contract technology. How to avoid technical loopholes in smart contracts, and achieve controllable business logic corrections and contract upgrades.

The fourth is key technology. Key security is the cornerstone of blockchain trust. In the unique technical structure of the private key, how to effectively prevent the private key from being stolen or deleted maliciously, and to remedy the loss and theft of the private key.

Fifth, integration of diversified technology platforms. How to optimize the multi-dimensional parallel interaction architecture to achieve efficient links between more participants; how to improve the quality and speed of data processing to achieve ultra-large-scale, high reliability, and high security requirements.

**Second, implement the national strategy for the digital economy.**

The attitudes and trends of developed countries on digital finance and digital economy deserve our attention.

The United States is concerned about digital financial market norms. The focus of US regulation is to regulate digital financial markets and prevent digital financial instruments from being used in illegal areas. In 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission included ICOs under supervision, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the Chicago Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to launch Bitcoin futures trading. In 2018, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stated that the regulatory strategy for digital currencies is to use case law enforcement rather than a systematic interpretation of securities laws, and to carefully, orderly, and actively clarify regulatory principles and boundaries.

Germany and France are concerned about digital sovereignty. On October 29, 2019, Germany and France announced the ""Gaia-X"" project involving German and French core companies, which aims to build a secure and reliable data infrastructure for Europe. German Economy Minister Peter. Altmeyer said that this infrastructure will help us regain digital sovereignty and lay the foundation for a digital ecosystem. French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno. Lemaire said the project will include data storage, data concentration and data sharing. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that what worries me most is that most of the processing of industrial and consumer data is done by American companies, and a kind of dependency relationship is being formed. Merkel advocates taking a long-term view and digitizing the overall layout from as many European perspectives as possible.

**We should implement the national strategy of the digital economy and maintain the security of the digital economy.**

**The first is to master autonomous and controllable technologies.**

On the underlying technologies such as the blockchain consensus mechanism and smart contracts, China currently lacks independent property rights. Most of the application projects in China use the open source blockchain underlying platform for adaptive adjustment and development, and optimize from the number of concurrent users, throughput, response time, availability, security, etc., to meet business needs, to achieve identity authentication, privacy Protection, node management and other functions.

Extensive application of foreign open source programs may lead to technology dependence risks, and must comply with the jurisdiction and legal constraints of the place where the open source platform is registered, potentially hiding geopolitical risks. For example, the terms of use of the open source program GitHub clearly state that the use of GitHub must not violate export control or sanctions laws in the United States or other applicable jurisdictions.

We should vigorously support technological innovation and strive to master digital technology. Clarify digital technology and digital industry policies, grant tax and fee concessions to digital technology R & D enterprises and professionals, encourage digital technology R & D and application, national team plus private team, Chinese plus foreign capital, large, medium, small and micro. In the field, we have independent and controllable intellectual property rights and establish global competitive advantages in key areas of digital economy and digital finance.

The development of next-generation computing architecture should be intensified to ensure the fairness and correctness of mathematical algorithms, the privacy and reliability of data, the security of the entire process and the entire cycle of data, and the speed and efficiency of mathematical algorithms.

**The second is to accelerate standardization and institutional innovation.**

The International Organization for Standardization ISO has established a blockchain and distributed ledger technical committee to study 11 standards, including terminology, reference architecture, privacy and personal information protection, security risks and vulnerabilities. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has established a distributed ledger technology security-related problem group to study 10 standards, including security assurance, security threats, and security framework. The development of IEEE standards for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is mainly focused on blockchain in the fields of IoT data management, digital asset management, government department applications, and cryptocurrencies.

China's blockchain financial standardization construction and institutional construction have just begun. We should pay close attention to improving the technical standards, security specifications, and certification review systems for blockchain finance. Clarify the legal definition of assets, clarify the contractual nature and effectiveness of smart contracts, and clarify the responsible subjects and their behavioral and regulatory standards in a distributed architecture.

Based on the healthy development of digital finance, China should speed up the construction of the digital financial system and step up efforts to formulate digital financial systems such as blockchain financial supervision, digital asset market supervision, digital currency supervision, and legal digital currency issuance. Make overall plans and gradually establish a digital trust mechanism.

Digital currency will occupy a core position in the future global digital economic competition. It is necessary to step up research on the feasible path and implementation plan for the issuance of China-led global digital currency. It is necessary to further explore the feasible path of China's legal digital currency, including alternative range selection, controllable anonymous scale, offline operation technology, and so on.

Digital finance is bound to further strengthen the globalization of finance. In the construction of the global system of digital finance, China should actively participate in and strive for the right to speak. It is necessary to strengthen international regulatory coordination, promote regulatory consensus, and establish a unified international regulatory standard for digital finance.",1575062257.0

What happens in our sub is that people from tribes of another crypto (in this case, and in all previous cases its the same community unfortunately) pose as investors/supporters and ask a question while fudding hard.

What they then do is go and comment lies, misinformation, and upvote tf out of it. Similar to how they do this on r/cc and have previously been banned for doing so. The next step of their tried and tested method of misinformation and FUD is to post on r/cc with a title like I have, and claim they were fully invested but sold due to xyz reason. These people are scammers that misinform and purposefully deceive the crypto community for their own benefit. In this case, they are against Waltonchain because they believe it to be a scam - even though the team is literally helping to set [China's blockchain standards](https://twitter.com/Waltonchain/status/1199628220611493888) along with another project, [Matrix AI Network](https://twitter.com/MatrixAINetwork/status/1199605419695427587), and entities like Tencent, Zhong An, Alibaba and JD.

>I can almost guarantee that this post will be either downvoted or reported and removed, but then another will surface which will be brigaded like f.

>""Wtf is going on with token swap???It seems like a month ago they said token swap was coming.Seems like they are just doing the same thing as last April in order to dump the rest of their coins.Does anyone even have proof they followed any of the multiple ""lockups"" ""

Just to answer this,

1. Token swap is happening - it has already occurred on two exchanges and talks are still happening with Huobi and Binance.
2. Token swap with personal wallets will be happening between now and January according to the latest update in Telegram.
3. 'they are doing the same thing as last april in order to dump the rest of their coins' is a FUD comment. EVERY ICO raises money to develop their project - and subsequently they do sell tokens on the open market to do so.
4. Yes, proof of lockup is that they have not sold any of the funds that you guys have said they did. For example, you've repeatedly said the team sold all the GMN payout funds. That was a lie.

**For all communities I urge you to ask questions - always seek answers and verify everything. But if you're entering a public forum to fud a project to mislead people AND have masses of your group brigade-upvote the post & negative comments, and to brigade-downvote the actual answers, then yes, I and the mod team will 100% call you out on it and delete the post.**

But I guess you could say this is the case for most crypto projects. While lack of voter participation, vote-buying, and the Chinese BP cartel seems to be something people got used to, patience is now running thin with dApp developers. EOS kind of dug its own grave by implementing REX, allowing EIDOS to abuse it rendering the chain basically unusable and BPs failing to take action. If that wasn't enough EIDOS now announced to be launching a [second 'mining' contract](https://www.eosgo.io/news/eidos-announced-their-soon-to-come-eos-sisterchain) to mine tokens for their upcoming chain.

Shortly after EarnBet, one of the bigger gambling dapps on EOS, [set an ultimatum](https://blog.earnbet.io/eos-30-day-notice/) and threatened to leave, Karma actually pulled through and yesterday announced they will be leaving EOS for good and migrate to WAX with a pretty [strong statement](https://medium.com/@karmaapp/karma-is-moving-from-eos-to-wax-b081100c2702).

Contrary to Karma they will remain on EOS and bridge both games and thus chains.

While I'm glad people finally start to understand, that EOS is not EOSIO and that other chains are actually viable options to deploy and run on at a fraction of the cost, I still hope the EOS community, and especially the BPs, take this as a warning shot and finally get their shit together.",1574906319.0

As in they won't ever swap coss to cos anymore which is fuckin stupid.  If you're still holding coss, good luck buddy.

But it gets better.  Their own exchange didn't even support auto exchange coss to cos.  How fuckin stupid is this?  I can understand if it's other exchanges since they'll probably ask for money but your own exchange?

Right before the swap, they had issues where coss disappeared on their own exchange. How is that even possible?  What happens to people who lost the coins and didn't get them returned before the swap?

Kraken joins the Silvergate exchange network: https://blog.kraken.com/post/3174/kraken-joins-silvergate-exchange-network/

Per FAQs on the Silvergate website (https://www.silvergatebank.com/digital-currency/exchanges.html), the Silvergate exchange network:

""enables our digital currency and institutional investor clients to send U.S. dollars 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year between their Silvergate bank accounts and the bank accounts of other Silvergate clients. This can be done via our API or online banking portal, enabling real-time transfers and immediate availability of funds.""

It kind of sounds like a Venmo for exchanges and their users. What is interesting is that also on the exchanges FAQ page they say:

""We believe that relationships are built on trust and take time to mature. This is why we like to start our relationship with exchanges by providing basic business banking services, while our compliance teams get to know each other and we evaluate whether a custodial banking relationship makes sense. As you can imagine, there is a significant amount of due diligence that needs to take place before we can offer custodial and cash management solutions to a licensed money services business.""

To me it sounds like the service that Silvergate is providing to Kraken with the Silvergate exchange network is more advanced than ""basic business banking"" services. I think this means that the compliance and diligence process was completed on Kraken? Kraken has been comfortable (and rightly so I think) with non-surveillance coins since almost the beginning.

I think the whole thing is encouraging given that Silvergate is publicly listed on the NYSE and lists exchanges such as Bittrex, who already lists Monero, as well as Coinbase, Circle, and Bitstamp as clients.",1574927054.0

Now you dont have to be a detective to see the similarities. When looking at their profiles they were dormant for a long time, and suddenly became active. All accounts talk just about coinzoom. Dont believe me?

Stay away from them.,54,e2butk,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/e2butk/another_crypto_scam_icoratingcom_our_8k_seized/,28,"Earlier this year we paid ICORating.com $8,000 for their services. Even though we were unsure when we'll be going ahead with our ICO, their team member (Leo) told us this is a ""limited offer"" and we can always avail their services later and if we decide to cancel the ICO later they'll be happy to refund the entire amount. He insisted we will won't get this offer again, and we might have to pay almost double later. So we paid. 

Now when we decided to call our off our ICO, they're not refunding the amount even though their policy on their website states otherwise. 

*1.6. In the event that the Client intends to cancel the services / works provided by ICORating and obtain a refund, they can do so only prior to the commencement of works /services. The Client will also take responsibility for all transaction costs related to there-transfer of the Client’s funds back to the Client. In the event of the Client’s cancellation of services / works after the commencement of works / services,100% of the price of the works / services will not be refunded to the Client and will be retained by ICORating.*

After paying them we never discussed or availed any of their services. Upon asking why they are going against their own policy, they made something up and said 1.6. policy number is only valid for advertising or listing. Nowhere on their policy page says so. 

It shouldn't be a surprise that they don't mention anyone from their team on the website. Their main communication manager is not aware of who the CEO is and calls himself an ordinary employee who has no idea of management: https://imgur.com/a/imD3UcY

&#x200B;

I understand the hate. I get that; It’s the necessary flip-side of fear.

If fear exists within someone, upon a particular subject, the expression of hate is the natural response of individuals who cannot face or process the fear.

**Richard Heart** is EXPANDING the lexicon of cryptocurrency.

Human beings evolve through their language.

Language evolves first then understanding follows.

The language of cryptocurrency is being created before our eyes.

HEX, like many other projects, represents an evolution in cryptocurrency.

HEX is ingraining elements of the traditional certificate of deposits along with characteristics of advanced game theory into the arena of cryptocurrency.

Been watching **Richard Heart** on YouTube A LOT lately. As an outside observer I am amazed. **Richard Heart** is compelling, focused, and knowledgeable.

Whether or not you like **Richard Heart** or understand the principles of HEX the takeaway that all of us should hope to hold is that EVEN IF HEX is unsuccessful in some ways, or even fails, the next HEX may be better. And the characteristics **Richard Heart** and HEX puts forth may help ethereum specifically and cryptocurrency in general.

I’m nobody. The reason I created this particularly long post is to process outside of myself, what is happening. Just for mentioning HEX or **Richard Heart** I was banned from /r/ethfinance forever. EVERY post I create in relation to HEX receives, almost exclusively,  negative responses.

Initially, I didn’t get it. Now I do. What I understand now is expressed in the first few sentences in this post.

We are on the edge or, out on a limb, of a brand new, exciting technology.

Be aware, HEX, along with many other exciting technologies, are moving us forward in adoption; In the lexicon of cryptocurrency. Do yourself a favor. Consciously work to keep your mind open.",1574978591.0

This means that to them, blockchain can exist without decentralization. I am making the assumption that china will not want to release or decentralize the control over the various systems which blockchain can improve on. 

So what about the various chinese cryptos which in part have been sold to enthusiasts / investors globally ?

Why do you believe that in the future, these projects will actually be worth anything when after the use cases have been created, what would stop the chinese government from simply CTRL C + CTRL V the code from the various good decentralized projects out there and placing that into something that they can force their citizens and businesses to use?

I am of the belief that these projects can create great blockchain use cases and can prove their worth for the mean time, however, they will all eventually fail ( in the sense to us that they will hold no value ) . All of their use cases will only become testbeds for what will be used in the future and they will all eventually die from companies such as wechat weibo alipay ( any state run and owned business ) who will literally copy and paste the tech and use it in their businesses which have already been adopted by their population. 

for the mean time, these projects will continue to pump and dump, but can anyone place a strong counter arguement as to why these projects should continue to survive long term? 

I find it much easier to believe that these projects were created to create great mainstream use cases for blockchain so that the chinese government can eventually use technology and code that they created within their own controlled systems, without having had so spend any of their own money on the research and development WHILE being funded by global investors. Sounds like a win win for China",1574912949.0

[https://www.bosch.com/de/stories/dlt-autos-die-mit-ladesaeulen-verhandeln/](https://www.bosch.com/de/stories/dlt-autos-die-mit-ladesaeulen-verhandeln/)

As the page is in German, I have added a translation below.

[BOSCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bosch_GmbH)  is a  large German-based company with € 78 billion ($ 85 billion) yearly revenue and heavily invested in the car supply industry. The page shows their strategic thinking and how important they expect Blockchain and Cryptocurrency to be.  It is a good example of how future adoption will look like.

No mention is made of which blockchain or digital ledger they are intending to use.

***Cars negotiating with charging stations***

*When a car negotiates the price of the electricity it charges itself, it not only simplifies the charging process. There is an outlook on the potential of the economy of things, in which, among other things, energy-economy processes can be optimized.*

*Get in, enter your destination, drive off - when Christian Heise and his family want to travel from Stuttgart to Berlin by car, everything seems quite ordinary at first glance. What's completely unusual, however, is what happens in the background: ""It's a view into the Internet of Things,"" as Heise says. As deputy director of the ""Economy of Things"" project at Bosch, he combines the topics of energy and mobility in a prototype that is to improve the charging process of electric cars based on blockchain technology - and at the same time take the networked world a big step forward.*

*Even if Heise only states his destination before the trip, the prototype, a software agent running on a computer in the trunk, knows what is important to its driver. Heise has saved these basic settings. For example, he wants the charge level on the journey to Berlin never to drop below 20 percent. He has set an upper limit for the price of electricity and would like to have a cup of coffee with his wife during the charging process, with a view to a playground for their son.*

***Economic value through networking***

*Reducing the range anxiety, negotiating the price for the charging process as low as possible and maximizing comfort for the user during charging by specifying point-of-interests - these are the three parameters that the artificial intelligence of the EV charging prototype tries to combine. ""Specifically, we bundle the logic into an economic agent, a program code that acts differently on different challenges.*

*This enables it to negotiate,"" says Heise. The result: ""Things decide which actions are economically viable for themselves and their clients,"" says Heise. It is the core of the Economy of Things. ""Our prototype shows how things negotiate with each other, i.e. how they exchange real values. An economic value is created through networking"".*

***Negotiating resources***

*Of course, this economic agent can only work sensibly if it communicates with other agents. Bosch works together with EnBW, for example, for this purpose. The energy company has developed the prototype of a charging station, which also has an economic agent. This intelligent charging station manager ""represents"" its own interests, such as availability and utilization of the charging station or sales targets. Vehicle and charging station can thus negotiate different and transparent price models via their software agents, which are offered to the driver for selection in real time.*

*The result of the negotiations is then manifested on the blockchain in a Smart Contract jointly developed by Bosch and EnBW. This standard contract, which contains the ID of the vehicle and charging station as well as the charging power and price, is stored in the decentralized network. ""The blockchain is the technical basis for coordinating EV charging processes independently of specific operators. We are working with our partners on the necessary legal acceptance of such contracts,"" says Heise. The conditions for the loading process are confirmed by both agents and the loading process can be carried out during insertion as specified in the contract. ""Our EV charging agent and the EnBW charging post agent are therefore each trying to achieve their goals as well as possible and are therefore negotiating their resources optimally,"" says Heise.*

***Marketplace for electricity***

*He sees another major advantage in decentralized systems with many agents based on distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain: ""Like on a marketplace, providers make their power available, with all relevant information. The agent can then scan its environment and select the appropriate offer for the driver. In a centralized system, all devices would first have to send their environmental data and requests to a coordinator, and each power provider would also have to send its own data. ""All this has to be calculated, is highly complex and requires enormous computing power,"" says Heise. If, on his way to Berlin, he is looking for a charging station at another location at short notice due to a traffic jam, the request is only placed where Heise is driving along, which means significantly less coordination effort and therefore lower resource consumption.*

***Socially fair distribution***

*The technology can thus also provide an answer to the question of whether there is enough electricity at all for the widespread use of electric cars. ""Distributed agent-based systems relieve us of critical energy infrastructure,"" says Heise. With the help of artificial intelligence, the loading times and locations of cars could be coordinated via the blockchain: ""An allocation algorithm could suggest loading the car at work or leaving it at home and commuting to work with a ride. The next day it could be changed."" This should further contribute to reducing peak loads.*

*Heise's goal is to bring together the needs in the areas of mobility and energy ""by allowing ride sharing, multimodal transport models and energy management to trade economically with each other"". At its core, a sociallly fair distribution mechanism is to be promoted. For example, Heise and his team are developing a security mechanism based on algorithms: It ensures that nobody is disadvantaged and prevents large stakeholders from joining forces and arbitrarily speculating on prices.*",1574813692.0

As of now, banks and credit networks completely control and leech off this economy while providing services that can be completely replaced by video cards.

2020 is coming soon! Halving is soon! When is the rally, gentlemen? Your bids?

What do you think, friends? We didn’t break through the 9500 mark, we couldn’t hold on to the 9000 mark and then, as predicted, we went down…. to the initial mark, where it all began ...

To be honest, I first was at this mark while being in a short position and prepared to pass the winter at 6400. But following a 40% upswing to 10350, I thought there would be a New Year rally. Now we crawl slowly down again. Halving is approaching and, given the terrible dynamics that the BTС is showing, I understand that anything can happen. It may go off before the new year, or after it, or maybe after halving. What is nice is that the craziness of the market continues unabated. No logical explanation, nothing. Once only we shot up by 40% and then immediately closed the gap.

Indeed, the events are strongly reminiscent of 2016, when we grew slowly but steadily before halving, and then that madness began. So, experts, the question is what are you expecting in December, where will we fall in January and when will we fly? J",1574803929.0

**Description**:

Compile and run Bitcoin full nodes, lightning nodes, and user-friendly web-apps that help abstract the complexities of Bitcoin. This book not only explains the tools and techniques to help readers build their own banks and banking apps, but it also tells a story. Starting with the origins of Bitcoin—what it is and why we need it—find out what its strengths and limitations are. Understand the nature of mining and why so much energy is put into it.  The blockchain itself will be reviewed, as well, and compared to other options such as a normal SQL database or a simple spreadsheet.

With this book, you can control Bitcoin wallets via RPC commands on a Raspberry Pi. Configure, compile, and run two implementation of the Lightning Network-compatible daemons: LND and c-lightning. And employ user-friendly web apps that abstract the complexities of Bitcoin/Lightning-Network.

The Internet of Information is currently transitioning to the Internet of Things, which in turn may well  be followed by the Internet of Value (or Money). However, there is no evolution without happy users and Bitcoin will never reach the same heights like the original internet without having offered “useful” and “easy to use” tools. Just like nobody would ever want to use UUCP to send messages via web the same applies to current cryptocurrency tools. These are hard to use and very unforgiving. But, the evolution doesn’t stop here and many easy-to-use tools are already available. We will meet some of them when building apps for the Lightning Network, a new technology running on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain that makes it possible to generate billions of transactions within a single second.  ",1574735688.0

The U.S. regulatory landscape has dramatically changed since 2017. Along with our efforts on being compliant, it became more and more difficult to satisfy the regulatory requirements with our U.S. entity from a compliance and auditing perspective. Moving forward, we've made this difficult decision:

We will cease all services for U.S. customers.

From November 25th, 2019, U.S. persons will no longer be able to create new accounts on GO.Exchange. For existing U.S. customers, we will close your account on December 16, 2019. You will have until that date to withdraw all your assets on GO.Exchange.

Given this news, to understand if you are affected by this change, we will define a U.S. customer as:

&#x200B;

1. &#x200B;
   1. Any U.S. citizen, whether the individual resides in the USA or abroad.
2. 2. Any individual that resides in the USA, including non U.S. citizens (ie. green card holders, individuals designated resident for U.S. tax purposes.

**Blast from the Past, their whitepaper:**

In the default configuration, it is presumed that an EPP holds funds directly on behalf of its users for ease-of-use. This is similar to full-custodian cryptocurrency wallets such as Coinbase or many centralized exchanges today. This allows for the EPP to construct fee-free transactions within their own network, as it doesn’t result in blockchain activity. However, it may also be possible to withdraw directly from the EPP and transact their issued token (e.g. fiat currency) on the OmiseGO chain (but transfers may result in on-chain fees if not transferred within an EPPs custodial account on-chain). This allows for decentralized transfers, as well as serving the needs of some EPPs which need zero-fee transactions on their own network. The EPP may provide software which is centralized similar to many hosted cryptocurrency wallets, which significantly reduces deployment time, and only payments crossing networks is hosted on the EPP’s infrastructure. Third parties may also in the future develop decentralized wallets which can hold EPP balances on-chain.

Then I remember seeing various posts here on reddit where users mentioned that they stored their keys in similar formats behind various forms of encryption. I decided to just generate a new wallet, and write down my private key on a sheet of paper and put it in my storage safe. Then, of course, I sent all of the crypto to the wallet on my new phone. Eventually I will commit the private key to memory.

When I talk about this I like to point out the incredible growth in BTC before futures or derivative trading. Now I’m not talking about the run up to $20k but $200 to $2-3K. That was an organic growth in buy-in and interest in crypto. Once futures and derivative trading is introduced bitcoin follows pretty reliable patterns of growth and recession centered around future prices. Also, it’s pretty well established that whales have created a pretty reliable income stream through opening short positions, selling a couple thousand BTC to induce panic selling, ride the price down a few thousand then closing the short while simultaneously opening long positions ride the recovery back up and rinse and repeat. Your average trader has minimal opportunity at windfalls on BTC like there used to be.

I also like to point out that this is the similar belief held about the US Equity market. It’s well known that derivative trading is a way for the wealthy to make more money.",1574461122.0

I’ve been thinking lately that no existing crypto or new crypto, as long as it can be purchased with normal currency, is safe from the already mega rich. Even coins that have to be mined, could be mined faster by someone with the capital to buy enough computing power. The only option I can see is to make all currencies obsolete, but that is very far off, if at all possible.

303,Is currency doomed?,0,e0cvvp,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/e0cvvp/is_currency_doomed/,6,"There are pretty clear definitions of currency. But I'd like to break it down to its core. Because if we understand really what it is, we can define what makes the ultimate currency, but also, more importantly, what the future holds for currency.

To understand currency we need only ask why. Why do we need currency? Simply, it gives me the ability to transfer ownership from one asset to another, quickly, seamlessly and with the option of divisibility. 

Think about the act of being paid a salary. You work for a company, hopefully providing value, for which you accrue remuneration - an asset. 

You do this to buy food, send your kid to school and buy a home. You could grow your food, teach your kid and make your own bricks and cement to build your own house. But this is inefficient, so we work where we can create better value and outsource our ultimate needs. Being paid a salary is disconnected for what your objectives are, but because of money we can connect them.

We could ask our employer to pay us in food, schooling and in housing, but that's inefficient and probably much harder to adjust month to month according to the specific needs. Again, the reason why we have money is because we need to transfer our ownership of work to a grocery, school and builder easily with them accepting it just in the same way you accept it, with the freedom to adjust that spend as you feel necessary and to have immediacy of receiving and converting. 

Currency is simply the universally accepted medium between swapping out assets, instead of bartering. So really the benefit comes down to efficiency, how easily can I transfer between two assets, knowing that it'll be accepted at the same value for which I received it. 

This means that any loss of that value along the way is inefficient for what my ultimate goal is - that goal has nothing to do with the money itself but rather assets at either end and having a 1:1 conversion for them. Fungibility comes down to the need for this goal of 1:1 transfer between people who value assets differently because of their unique needs - currency unifies value. Any friction is therefore suboptimal to achieve actually what we require out of currency. 

Time wastage, devaluation through inflation, costs and fees, and also more broadly speaking an economic burdnen on 3rd parties, is friction. Although neither of these are deal breakers - because even dollars incur bank charges, devalue over time and can take time to receive and send, yet we still use dollars - we should certainly strive to have the most frictionless currency to benefit the end user the most.

Cryptocurrency, in the purest sense of the word currency, should strive to be the most frictionless form of value transfer on the blockchain. It should allow me to buy and sell assets at no additional cost to me, to the economy or to the environment. The more fluid and more liquid this is, the closer it comes to providing this ultimate need.

But really the final reality, because of this very dissection of why we need currency, I conclude that, because of Blockchain, all currency is ultimately doomed. Let me clearly state that this probably won't even happen in my lifetime -but certainly currencies, of all forms, will not survive when Blockchain matures. Why? Because it will give me to the ability to do those asset  transfers instantly and divisibly, without the intermediary of currency. The fractional ownership that Blockchain can assign to anything is the key that unlocks this.

At the end of the month when I am to be paid my salary, I could select to get remunerated in bread tokens, school tokens and house tokens, at what ever ratio I need at the time with no inconvenience to my employer. I can be paid in stocks and bonds if I want to leave my asset in something liquid that will (most likely) increase in value over time. Blockchain will eventually make all these value transfers between all assets so seamless and divisible, there will be no need for an intermediary currency.

So yes, the hype is correct that banks in a traditional sense are doomed - but ultimately, so is currency itself because it too is an intermediary.",1574511437.0

Has anyone from the US had problems withdrawing funds from Kucoin ? I don't want to get funds stuck there, since I'm not sure if I could ever successfully do the KYC to get unstuck.

I have previously used Binance and Poloniex, but both have banned US users, and Binance US has not come to my state.",1574479405.0

Bottom line: if doing transactions on the blockchain is expensive an inefficient enough that large institutions (esp financial ones) are moving to off-chain transactions, doesn't that kind of negate the purpose of many cryptocurrencies altogether? If it's more convenient not to use them... then the main thing they're supposed to bring to the market (easy of use an security) is de facto failing, right? 


If that's correct, what's the solution? Blockchains that are 'faster' or more liquid? Am I missing something or is this potentially going to be a bigger issue moving forward.",1574465739.0

Noone is altruistic here. There is no moral quarter.

No question, technology makes our lives better. Being on the waxing side of technology does not hurt either.

Is, what we are approaching, **a break of humanity from humanity** as we presently know it?

Physically and psychologically our brains and our consciousness are not the same as our distant ancestors.

I see a future where if you have the ability to mine or stake you will have a source of substance. If you don’t - you don’t.

Hello all, I’m proud to share with you my latest book: Blockchain Blues. In this novelette, several cryptocurrency traders are interviewed as they reminisce through their massive gains and losses in the market bubble of the last 1-2 years. 

The story is semi-biographical and follows the tone of the trailer video below. I wanted to try and capture the feelings and emotions behind the hype of blockchain technology. 

For people outside this space that might want to see what it was like, or for those of you that also rode these waves and want to feel some nostalgia, check it out!

They can manipulate people into consensus. What if governments decide that you are the enemy of the state? The USA and China are big and evil.

These groups can decide to take away some individuals' or enemy groups' money by proposing a fork. Or they can decide to change the code of the currency, making it serve their own needs, manipulating its value or just ruining it. They can run campaigns to devalue currencies. Governments ban currencies, or tax the shit out of them, or ""regulate"" them.

It's possible for them to reach consensus. Manipulating people on the internet is too easy. They already collect data on everyone, they already use ads to manipulate people during elections. SJWs fight to ruin the internet. There are witchhunts to ruin people's lives. ""News"" sites spread false information, ruining people's lives.

In 2016 some stupid developers accidentally gave away their money on Ethereum. Stupid ""investors"" agreed to a consensus to steal that money, to compromise Ethereum. They fucking won.

The same thing can happen to protestors, whistleblowers, people with unpopular opinions.

Don't let people manipulate you when they want to steal others' money. Fight governments deanonymizing everyone, attacking cryptocurrencies, taking away people's privacy. Don't participate in witchhunts, fight witchhunts.

It might be time to filter out the noise in crypto *(particularly the tribalism and vulture culture - some of which you'll see in the comments below by tribal crypto fan boys)* and do some research into these entities that are literally terraforming the entire blockchain landscape in the Silicon Valley of China. 

We must remember that no single cryptocurrency will be 'the coin' of China, and any notion that suggests so is simply delusional. We must also remember that the consultants involved with setting reference architecture of blockchain standards must be taken seriously - the cryptos that want to operate in China will no doubt be adhering to policies and standards set out by these consultants.",1574186615.0

I put the ""media"" flair for this post...

On my OS X computers the Coindesk site is not usable under Firefox and buggy (and hard to use) under Chrome.

On Linux I only tested under Firefox and it's not usable: same bug as on OS X. I can see the headlines but get a ""black page"" when I try to click to read an article.

How is it possible to redesign a site which was working previously and fuck up so badly? I mean people literally didn't bother to try to open the site with the latest Firefox under either OS X or Linux (and my hopes aren't high for Windows but I cannot test atm).

It's not about the cookies / GDPR consent / email and whatnots: it simply is full on buggy.

Does anyone know where I can send an email with my feedback?

471,My concerns about Monero.,4,dyn83m,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/dyn83m/my_concerns_about_monero/,11,"I contacted Monero's Telegram group because I had some privacy concerns regarding XMR. I don't belive in untracable arguments. Because anything can eventually be broken. I'm working on Tails, so please see my questions as my work env is working on Tails.

This where my questions:

* What happens when i'm sending XMR through a ""compromised"" remote Tor node? Can I lose funds when they are compromised or shuts down their server?**Answer: It's possible you can lose funds if it's a compromised remote node.**
* Since I don't use Whonix but Tails for most things why is there no option built in to connect directly to a node with Tor?**Answer: Use Whonix to Tails for local nodes.I don't use a dedicated pc/laptop. I'm only using a burner laptop with Tails. So downloading the whole blockchain ain't efficient for me.**
* How do I know whether a remote node is compromised?**Answer: No answer.**
* I don't want to use my own IP or use a public wifi or anything. I just want to route my connection to a remote node with Tor, but I don't want to lose my funds.**Answer: Don't use Tor anyways since it's a CIA honeypot and use ProtonVPN with a Tor server??????????????????**
* I really don't understand how XMR can be that private when you don't route your connection through Tor.**Answer:** [**lmgtfy.com/?q=Monero+over+Tor**](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=Monero+over+Tor)**.**
* Do I have to explain it again? I'm already connected to a remote Tor node.**Admins: Why do I need to hide my tracks. I'm not a criminal.**
* How is is this anonymous if you use your own IP to connect to a remote node without using Tor for it. I really don't understand this part.**Answer: You use your IP, or use VPN or Tor, thats for IP. But in Monero's blockchain there are not ""browse that chain"" like for BTC/ETH. You don't see who send and where.**
* That doesn't matter. I just don't want to connect to a remote node with my own IP or VPN since a VPN provider is based on trust. Just Tor to a node that's not compromised and without downloading the whole blockchain.
* Someone else: You can browse all transactions in Monero, you can't see where they came from.**My answer: You don't understand my point. I just don't want to connect to a remote node with my own IP or VPN.**
* Someone else: Run a VPN/Anyelse and proxy Monero.**My answer: A VPN is not secure if you can't trust the provider. This is not a solution for a ""privacy-minded"" coin.Someone else's answer: Be your own provider, connect to a public wifi, change mac.Someone else's answer: Like 99% of Tor nodes are run by the CIA.**

All questions regarding Tor are ignored or they advice me to use a VPN or run my own node. Am I asking weird questions because I really don't understand this. They are making jokes about this, but I'm really asking questions related to my privacy..",1574211910.0

Recently I 'm a co-founder of a blockchain project also. The idea behind it is very simple, but, in my opinion, can have major implications. 

We have created a software where users (our focus is on enterprises or institutions) can connect to their databases and transfer the data to the desired blockchain. Basically, there will be no need for them to create their own blockchain. Imagine a university transferring all the grades from the DB to a blockchain with only a couple clicks. They will stop grades manipulation immediately.

In the last couple of weeks, I have sent more than a hundred emails to various crypto influencers and to several airdrop platforms (yes, we have created an airdrop on our webpage. It is necessary to gain social networks exposure). 

I mainly asked crypto influencers for any feedback which will be very helpful to us. For now, everybody's 1st response is their price. And the price they are asking is a bit ridiculous for me. $5k for a tweet from a user with 100k followers. All airdrop platforms asked for ETH for publishing. Except one, that told me that they will list us for free because they liked our project. Eventually, they listed us only after I send them our tokens. Fortunately, most of the platforms published us eventually when they realized that we have a genuine project.  

What I'm trying to say is that I feel there is no excitement for the new projects. It seems that most of the community is disappointed with various scams, and new and legit projects mostly go below the radar. It is like that crypto space is owning them something and they want to cash out at any price.
