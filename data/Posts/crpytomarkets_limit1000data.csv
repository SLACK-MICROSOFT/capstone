https://preview.redd.it/iims4ecubl141.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6986a88188c7879a4441fc9f4de05912cddcc138

 

Toward the end of 2017 Twitter was flooded with statements like: ‚Äú*Down with the banks!*‚Äù; ‚Äú*Crypto vs government!*‚Äù; ‚Äú*We don‚Äôt need regulation!*‚Äù

All that quickly changed in 2018 after the market crash. Afterwards, the battle cries turned into:

* **We need regulation!**
* **Who allowed this to happen?**
* **ICO market is full of scams!**
* **They changed the terms on their investors, why is nobody doing anything!**

Lots of investors can resonate with the latter claims. ICOs have frequently changed their vesting schedule without any warning to investors. Indeed, up until last year, it wasn‚Äôt even clear to whom ICO‚Äôs had to report their metrics.

Another problem for many ICOs are banks, or more so the lack of banks.

Finding crypto-friendly banks is hard, and most projects you see out there do not have a bank account. Not because banks are worried about going out of business from the pending blockchain revolution or any of that, but simply because the level of KYC & AML done by most ICOs and exchanges does not satisfy required regulatory guidelines. Or at least this is what the banks say.

So, in order to build a global lasting infrastructure, we first wanted to make sure that we establish a solid foundation in a country with clear legal crypto guidelines.

## Switzerland: trial and error

We started our journey back in 2017 in Switzerland. Many projects were heading in that direction and it looked like a good idea**,** especially after [FINMA (the Swiss Financial Authority)](https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2018/02/20180216-mm-ico-wegleitung/) announced its detailed ICO guidelines in February 2018.

It made sense to attempt to build in an environment with an established set of rules, but things were not as established as they seemed.

Since FINMA was just publishing some guidelines, and there was no bill to explain and enforce the regulations, nothing was actually clear. The market was booming, and Swiss banks were ready to profit of the boom. They told us that our KYC & AML had to be done by a certified KYC provider in Switzerland. Needless to say that the price for this services were 10x the average market price.

After months of trying to get a clear view of what we are supposed to do, what our token will be legally considered, countless discussions with our lawyers, banks, and KYC/AML providers, we decided to give up on this slow and expensive option. It was time to go back to the drawing board and look for a different jurisdiction. One in which blockchain, crypto, and ICOs were regulated, but also one where we could move a lot faster.

## Malta: faster and cheaper

It turned out Malta was the answer for us. It still requires a lot of work, and countless discussions, but at least in Malta we found solutions for most of our problems.

The Maltese gov. passed 3 bills in June 2018 regarding cryptocurrencies, blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) marking it one of the first jurisdictions in the world to [pass specific legislation around the tech](https://www.coindesk.com/malta-passes-three-bills-on-blockchain-and-crypto-assets).

Consequently, we have incorporated Elrond Ltd. in Malta. We are in the process of obtaining a license, that will enable the company to issue the Elrond token, list on exchanges, and publicly raise funds through an ICO.

Currently we are in the private seed funding stage and NOT at the final public sale round. Given that we are in the process of getting license from Malta‚Äôs financial authority**,** legal reasons prohibit us from publicly disclosing various financial information at this point.

As soon as the license is cleared however, we‚Äôll be able to be as transparent as possible and share all relevant financial information. To be sure, the Maltese law ensures a higher transparency level by requiring ICOs to make a series of documents public, such as shareholders, whitepaper certification, board of directors, appoint an auditor, a VFA agent, a MLRO agent, and a custodian, establish a cyber-security framework, ensure that there are appropriate systems in place to satisfy AML/CFT requirements, etc.

Regulation is evolving fast, and we‚Äôve learned a lot from trying to go through all legal hurdles in Switzerland first. Perhaps the most important lesson being that lawyers can kill your startup if you let them decide business matters on your behalf. Still, some regulation might be useful for most ICOs. Even licenses like the one required in Malta might help protect some investors by adding higher accountability standards.

In the end, it is up to the community to take time for serious due diligence and reward good behavior with trust and support. As long as there is balance between consumer protection and permissionless innovation, it is up to blockchain projects to raise the standard and adopt self governing principles.

https://preview.redd.it/y2m8xinj1l141.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b9ac24c0077fe5423a0d492b7f70b5e06fd0be0

&#x200B;

14th of July, 2019 ‚Äî [Elrond](https://elrond.com/) ‚Äî the sharding-based public blockchain network is proud to announce a cooperation agreement with [Runtime Verification](https://runtimeverification.com/) for research and development in core areas of formal verification methods.

Elrond is using the [K Framework](https://runtimeverification.com/k/), developed by Grigore Rosu while at NASA and the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, as the backbone for all of its smart contract languages. Grigore has continued development of K Framework with his team at Runtime Verification which specializes in formal methods. Building on this, Elrond has developed an in-house GO backend to integrate the [IELE](https://github.com/runtimeverification/iele-semantics) VM, which is designed by the Runtime Verification team, and constructed entirely on the K Framework. Elrond is also working to integrate [KEVM ](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics)and [WASM ](https://github.com/kframework/wasm-semantics)in a similar fashion. Having the VMs built using the K Framework gives Elrond access to powerful formal verification tools.

The Elrond research and development team will work closely with Runtime Verification to further develop the K framework and its capability to generate correct-by-construction Virtual Machines for the blockchain. Through the research and development initiative between Elrond and Runtime Verification we aim to take smart contracts to the next level, and to make the GO backend developed by Elrond for the K framework, open source and available to the wide public.

Other Runtime Verification contributors or supporters include Ethereum, Algorand, IOHK, Casper, Maker DAO, Gnosis, Toyota and others.

 

>*‚ÄúWe at Runtime Verification are very excited to see Elrond‚Äôs commitment to not only use, but also contribute to the development of the basic infrastructure of the K Framework. Although ‚Äúformal verification‚Äù is now a buzzword in the blockchain community, in reality few blockchain companies genuinely understand the critical, almost desperate need of formal specification and verification of smart contracts. And even fewer understand that this starts with the formal modeling of the programming languages and virtual machines, and that formal analysis tools tend to be buggy, too, unless they are derived from such formal models. Elrond takes security at heart and follows the best known practices to assure safe and secure operation of their blockchain.‚Äù says* *Grigore Rosu, CEO of Runtime Verification.*  
*‚ÄúElrond brings a significant improvement to the blockchain space, setting new performance standards in terms of throughput and execution speed. In addition to performance, we believe dev tools and security measures like formal verification methods are instrumental for developers. Through the partnership with Runtime Verification we intend to raise the security standard by adding formal verification to our smart contracts, while integrating K framework to support several VMs and smart contract languages at the same time.‚Äù* *says Beniamin Mincu, CEO of Elrond.*

**About Elrond**  
Elrond is a new blockchain architecture, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 5-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.

Elrond is built by a team of experienced entrepreneurs along with 13 engineers and researchers with significant blockchain backgrounds and technical experience at Microsoft, Google, Intel, and NTT DATA. The team includes two PhDs in CS & AI, multiple math, CS, and AI Olympiad champions, and a former member of the NEM core team.",1575043444.0

As the new year begins, we‚Äôre taking some time to recalibrate our vision, refresh our roadmap, and set the stage for our next significant milestone.

## Making sense of the crypto winter

The promise of blockchain technology has brought tremendous excitement and euphoria, reaching a local peak in December 2017. Understandably, it is in our nature to get excited and overestimate the short term impact of technology. By contrast, 2018 was a year of correction, reckoning, and cleansing. By the end of the year, many supposed crypto funds were but one step from insolvency, with dozens of the once-promising crypto projects nearly bankrupt.

While nearly everyone got burned with the correction,‚Äùeasy money‚Äù has practically evaporated. The market has not only cleansed the landscape, but has also pushed back on the immediate visions of our future.

Still, it is precisely when most people lose hope, stumble and falter, that the greatest opportunities arise. The night is darkest before dawn. But the dawn is coming.

# About Elrond

Elrond is a new blockchain architecture, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 5-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.

Elrond is built by a team of experienced entrepreneurs along with 13 engineers and researchers with significant blockchain backgrounds and technical experience at Microsoft, Google, Intel, and NTT DATA. The team includes two PhDs in CS & AI, multiple math, CS, and AI Olympiad champions, and a former member of the NEM core team.",1574912122.0

The first killer app for blockchain has been here for a while and that is money. Be it in the form of stable coins, tokens or many of the emerging decentralized finance tools, crypto‚Äôs core use case right now is value transfer and trading. The cryptocurrency markets represent the sum of centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, dark pools and over-the-counter trading. While the total value exchanging hands every day is in the tens of billions of dollars, only certain cryptocurrency pairs have significant volume, and even that is fragmented over a number of different exchanges.

[Orion Protocol](https://orionprotocol.io/) is a liquidity aggregator that connects centralized & decentralized exchanges to give cryptocurrency buyers & sellers access to more volume and tighter spreads. By deploying a set of smart contracts for managing liquidity and matching & executing orders directly between different chains, traders will have access to more liquidity than any single exchange and more cryptocurrency pairs which they can trade with less friction and costs.

Capitalizing on narrow timeframes of opportunity, quickly matching orders and executing trades in real time is critical for the success of Orion. In order to achieve its goals, Orion Protocol has chosen Elrond as infrastructure partner, to benefit from our top performing Virtual Machine and near-instant smart contract execution, as well as the high throughput and low costs that we natively provide. Elrond‚Äôs additional blockchain interoperability capabilities will contribute to Orion Protocol‚Äôs long-term success.

Recent positive developments in the cryptocurrency space had some investors hoping that bitcoin would continue to see gains, but trading sentiment is still massively bearish at the moment, with shorts way ahead of longs by a huge margin.  


When everything goes down to finding a bottom for Bitcoin, will the storm intensify before any sign of brighter days emerge? What does it mean for a trader who is a novice that has not experienced any of these pullbacks? If someone is completely new to this crypto markets rinse/repeat system, in order to position themselves in the best position possible, they need to learn the ropes and make sure they don't make any otherwise avoidable mistakes.  


If not, the ""FOMO"" in their investment, which sometimes tempts them to buy instantly, is one of the most common mistakes particularly for beginners. A question like this happens when there is a sudden positivity of bull trend briefly in a current bearish market that does not last long and instead returns to their previous price points or even lower. This momentary bull is what was called the ‚Äúbull trap‚Äù ‚Äì a moment when someone buy his/her stock in fear the price will continue to rise and ends up being the wrong choice in the end.  


So how do they know if the feeling of a certain market is a bear or bull trap? Unfortunately, there is no definitive way to identify one for sure. There are, however, resources and techniques that can be used to mitigate these risks and potentially make a profit. New traders must be familiar with the different terminology and language used in the financial industry before any progress can be made.

1. **Immediate payout:** You won't have to wait for dispute rounds, or for a consensus. When a wager resolves, your winnings are immediately transferred to your account.
2. **No risk of ""Invalid market"":** You don't have to worry that your winning wager is an ""invalid market"".
3. **Easy to Audit:** The entire client-side javascript UI is contained in just one HTML file. The solidity contracts are verified, so you can view their source code at Etherscan.
4. **100% De-centralized**: There are no server-side calls. The **Resolution Sources** are all called by the static contract, to other static contracts.

&#x200B;

 

St. JULIANS, MALTA and BUCHAREST ‚Äî 27 November, 2018 ‚Äî [Elrond Ltd,](https://elrond.com/)the technology company developing a new, scalable and more efficient blockchain platform, supporting negligible fees and a finality of just a few seconds, today announced a new agreement with one of the leading payment providers, [NETOPIA Payments](http://www.mobilpay.ro/public/en/).

NETOPIA is the biggest electronic payment processor in Romania, expecting to process in 2018 more than 13 million digital transactions with a total value of around $400 Million.

Elrond and NETOPIA aim to jointly explore the potential of integrating Elrond‚Äôs token, ERD, into the NETOPIA payment platform allowing their merchants to offer on their turn to their users and clients the possibility to acquire products and services through ERD tokens as well.

This will also mean that 6,000+ merchants who are using the NETOPIA solutions will be able to accept ERD cryptocurrency overnight, with no development or operational costs on their part.

Beniamin Mincu, CEO and Founder of Elrond, commented: ‚Äú*Elrond is focused on helping people enjoy greater freedom and peace of mind when they‚Äôre online and, especially when they are making payments. By working with NETOPIA and including ERD as a payment option, this new relationship will make it even easier for thousands of consumers to benefit from added security, and enjoy faster and easier payments.*‚Äù

‚Äú*Like Elrond, NETOPIA is a disruptive leader in its field and this agreement represents a fantastic opportunity for us to deliver added services to our merchants and their clients*‚Äù said Antonio Eram, CEO and Founder of NETOPIA. ‚Äú*It‚Äôs great to be working with an innovative partner that is committed to mutual success. We look forward to developing innovative new payments solutions with Elrond that benefit our clients and help NETOPIA‚Äôs continuous growth.*‚Äù

Elrond and NETOPIA are also expressing their interest in exploring other, but not limited, potential use cases, related to blockchain technologies, payments, and privacy.

So basically this article saying that there's a good likelihood that the PRC is going to launch their own crypto exchange. They're already ganging up on the domestic exchanges (again) and at least CZ personally. It's not looking good for exchanges that are sort of skirting the law there. 

Now that they are planning on releasing their own nationally-backed Yuan CBDC, they'll need somewhere to handle the currency exchanges so people can onramp into CBDC. 

Expect a Chinese exchange with CBDC?

We just moved from the Build Phase to the Challenge Phase. After they had us dig the trenches and switch to different shards, it‚Äôs time to prove just how much we can process. So far, we worked together as a team, and did over 1 billion transactions, sometimes even 30.000 per second, before the slowest of us fail and then we start again. Today we are at 1.000 TPS and holding, let‚Äôs see what they throw at us next.

As we get better at configuring the nodes and letting them do battle, there‚Äôs more time to read and do some work for missions. They made us send our favorite food as part of a transaction ‚Äî I missed you so much when I told the boys about your Orange Ginger Honey-Cakes.

Then they had us send transactions, with all the money that we earned or from all the different shards. I now understand which address is from where and why is that important and order of times faster. Elrond

The problem is, I don't make a lot of money so the amount that I put in is pretty much the maximum that I feel comfortable putting in at the moment, but like everyone...I WANT MORE!  So, I'm wondering if this is a smart idea to gain more money to use and if so, what cryptocurrency would you guys recommend buying into?

I looked into a lot of them and aside from VET, my top picks in no order are:

OCE

IOTA

ICX

XMR

XRP

NANO

The reason I picked these is because all of them seem to be doing things differently than the other blockchains out there, they seem to be managed well, the people behind them seem legit along with their partners, and aside from Monero, they're all pretty low by-ins with the potential for pretty big gains in the relative short term. 

I don't really have enough to consolidate so ideally, I'm just looking to pick one.  So, with that said what do you guys think I should buy in and why? 

Thank you in advance!",1574062634.0

It various from signing a ""*Contract for the Web*"" to blockchain ledger solutions like good old BITCOIN & ETH to new networks for Iot devices (IOTA, IOST) to protecting our browsers and create new browsers / search engins (BRAVE) to AI networks for controle of our data sharing & data-ownership (OCEAN, DeepBrainchain) and even ideas to completely rewrite the DNS / HTTP protocolls to create a totaly new Web for more security and efficiency (SENTIVATE).

I'm wondering what would be a better option; leave it to gouvernements and scientist to agree on new rules and principles. Or let (blockchain companies) create solutions around the existing protocolls and infrastructure so we can put the big privacy-ignoring companies on a sideline, or build a totally new network with new protocolls and a new ""network language"" to take back controle ?

Any thoughts or point of views ? Am interested what you guys and gals think about which direction these developments are heading... Am still reading to inform myself but it's a hell of a job...

The use of blockchain technology in real estate by the IATokens project has several advantages. Blockchain allows you to democratize real estate properties that open up opportunities for potential investors from all over the world to try their hand at real estate investments. Blockchain makes it possible to change the way you invest in real estate. Real estate as a valuable asset can be tokenized and sold through the IAT platform. Smart contracts will autonomously fill out sales and property records, which is checked by the blockchain and automatically executed when the predefined conditions are met. If the conditions are not met, the funds will be returned to the buyer almost instantly. Besides, blockchain reduces the cost of real estate transactions, allows you to increase the speed of transactions and makes them transparent. It is transparency and short processing time that is what buyers and sellers prefer, and the main reason why they continue to use this technology when purchasing or selling real estate.

I came across this site from a banner ad on coinmarketcap.com. After reading and watching all their content, doing a little bit of research, it appears that AMFEIX is basically an investment fund where anyone can join into a pool of investors who entrust their bitcoins into a ‚Äògroup of expert crypto traders and market analyst‚Äô to grow the fund (which is currently at 3,832BTC). They have a lot of documentation and content across their online platforms to make it seem legit, but there are also more than a few red flags.

This is a new company, with an unknown number of employees, registered in the U.A.E., with only one physical location in South Africa. They have one person as the face of the company (on their LinkedIn page) and he appears to be just that, a face, not the CEO or the head crypto trader.

There are a few other red flags but one thing this company is not is a ponzi or pyramid scheme, it just doesn‚Äôt fit the characteristics of those. But the ultimate questions prevails: what stops this company from just walking away with my bitcoins?

I decided to check it out for myself so I opened a wallet through their website, sent the minimum amount to invest (.02BTC) and watched it grow to .02010499 in 6 days. Then I withdrew my bitcoins back to my home wallet. Seemed a little too simple actually.

While this company consists of a lot of red flags, it also has the potential to be a successful venture if they take steps to legitimize themselves and address a potential investor‚Äôs concerns, especially those who do not have the time or know-how to trade cryptos, while still believing in their potential on ROI. Ultimately, as is the old fail safe when it comes to anything dealing with cryptocurrency investing, don‚Äôt put it more than you are willing to lose.

(I put more BTC into the fund, will report back)",1573856975.0

The goal of the founders was to create a simple and secure platform for people all over the world to use to trade a range of digital coins. It's safe to say that KuCoin can be considered as one of the top crypto-exchanges of today. Since it was launched, the KuCoin exchange has not experienced any notable problems, and generally, the exchange does not suffer from any system overloads. It's now possible to access the Kucoin platform through a desktop computer, as well as on the Kucoin app on both Android and iOS.  
Now, KuCoin recently released a [margin trading platform](https://kucoinblog.com/learn-how-to-margin-trade-on-kucoin-sk-rd). Margin Trading is determined as a method of trading where tokens or funds are borrowed by the user on KuCoin to execute a buy or sell operation. This permits a trader to earn larger profits on trades by leveraging greater sums of capital using a small amount of funds. When compared to regular trading accounts, margin accounts allow traders to access greater sums of capital, allowing them to leverage their positions. Essentially, margin trading amplifies trading results so that traders can realize larger profits on successful trades. 

[To start margin trading](https://kucoinblog.com/learn-how-to-margin-trade-on-kucoin-sk-rd) on KuCoin, one must sign in to or create a KuCoin account. When a margin trade is initiated, the trader will be obliged to commit a percentage of the total order value. This initial investment is known as the margin, and it is closely related to the concept of leverage. In other words, margin trading accounts are utilized to create leveraged trading, and the leverage describes the ratio of borrowed funds to the margin. The advent of margin trading could further complement the trading ecosystem, allowing users to choose a suitable service based on their trading strategy. This will result in larger gains in the fast-growing crypto world.",1573657144.0

In the last couple days alone I have lost more than 100 comment karma, from over 1100 to 948, to these aggressive individuals seeking to manipulate the narrative, and 'lean on me' to stop posting information they don't like.** 

**If you look at my comment karma by sub breakdown, [visible in this comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/comments/duep61/coinbase_clears_up_misconceptions_about_asics/f75v06h/), you can clearly see that if you sum up my comment karma, I should have around ~2200. In r/dashpay alone I have 1300 comment karma. Yet if you hover over my username, I only have 906. This is due to vote brigading and is damning proof of it.**


https://blog.coinbase.com/how-coinbase-views-proof-of-work-security-f4ba1a139da0

There has been a lot of discussion both in r/btc and the greater cryptocurrency community alike about the importance of POW and how it relates to the economic incentives that undergrid the day-to-day operation of cryptocurrency networks. I believe because so many people do not truly understand the innovation of POW that they become easily confused and fall for scams like POS and ASIC-resistance. Luckily, Coinbase has explained some of their rationale behind their decisions to accept certain coins after a certain number of blockchain confirmations.

>Different cryptocurrencies add to their blockchains in different ways. In cryptocurrencies that utilize proof of work, the blockchain is extended by a process known as mining. Miners bundle newly announced transactions together into data structures called blocks, which are added to the blockchain.

>A miner attempts to add a block by solving a proof of work puzzle unique to the proposed block. If the miner can find a solution to the puzzle, the miner will announce the block and its solution to the rest of the network. The rest of the network will recognize the valid proof of work solution and consider the proposed block as the most recent addition to the blockchain. Notice that there is no permission required for a miner to produce a block, a fact that allows miners to enter and leave the network at will.

Seems pretty standard, right? 

>Claim one: **It is a security feature for a particular coin‚Äôs mining operations to be the dominant application of the hardware used to mine that coin.**

This is important as we have seen for smaller coins with larger coins with the same mining hardware. As we've seen with BCH, its possible for larger coins to 'attack' coins with less hashpower, which is why the fliippening is so important for us as a community. As soon as the market prices in the fact that BCH has a superior user experience to BTC, then the miners will 'flip' their hashrate to BCH and BTC will maintain a minority position. 

I contend, however, that for this to happen, we first need **_*accurate pricing mechanisms*_** so that when we assess how the market is responding, we are not being mislead by exchange price manipulation which I contend is very heavy currently in this thread: [The REAL reason for the price decline or the anatomy of a shakedown! Exchange price manipulation is behind the recent 'decline'](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/d983o5/the_real_reason_for_the_price_decline_or_the/). If we use [fair value](https://www.coinfairvalue.com/) instead to price our coins, we can see an actual, objective comparison. For example, BCH is now only  $294.9 to BTC's  $9,068.75 or only 3%, but how much of this is exchange manipulation? According to fair value, BCH is actually worth $528.24 while traditional BTC is only worth $6,096.09 for a ratio of ~9% which is **3 times better than exchange price would have you believe!**

>Owners of the hardware lose the value of their investment if the primary application of the hardware loses value.

>Hardware owners are incentivized to consider the long term success of the main application of their hardware. The longer the lifetime of their equipment, the more invested they become in the long-term success of the hardware‚Äôs primary application. At time of writing, Bitcoin ASICs are beginning to have significantly longer useful lifespans as efficiency increases of newer models are diminishing.

Another thing they point out is that ASIC resistance is a fool's game:

>Algorithm changes to ‚Äúbrick ASICs‚Äù **simply allow the massive general purpose computational resources of the entire world to mine, and potentially disrupt, a cryptocurrency at will.** Coins that have implemented ‚ÄúASIC-resistant‚Äù algorithms have been, empirically, very susceptible to 51% attacks for this very reason. **Notable examples of ASIC-resistant coins that have been successfully 51% attacked include BTG, VTC, and XVG.** To date, there is not a single case where a coin that dominates its hardware class has been subject to a 51% double spend attack.

As I pointed out earlier this year in this thread, [Further evidence that, despite what's detractors desperately want you to believe, fair value is accurately tracking the wealth in the market in real time! Monero's fair value decreases by 40% as miners leave network,](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/an2nzd/further_evidence_that_despite_whats_detractors/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=btc&utm_content=t3_ccqa74) Monero also was under a unique, far worse form of 51% attack this year that nearly completely destroyed their community. As further evidence I was correct above, only fair value accurately reflected the change in Monero's worth. The price, on the other hand, remained sky-high. This is **heavy evidence of exchange price manipulation** and another reason why ASIC resistance doesn't work.

By actively forcing and keeping ASICs off the network, the monero community continued building an ASIC-free ecosystem and economy based on low-hash CPU and GPUs. **Which meant that when an asic _*was actually developed*_ as we know they always will be that economy would be destroyed**. You went from a 'large' community of solo miners on CPUs and GPUs to a single entity getting the majority of the hashrate and bankrupting the entire community. This happened wtih every coin when they moved to ASICs. The difference with Monero? Monero's move to ASICs will have been artificially delayed until the community is so large that the introduction will BANKRUPT the majority of economic participants mining! This is worse than a traditional 51% attack and it succinctly summarizes why ASIC resistance is bad idea.

The main takeway:

>**No algorithm is ever ASIC-proof, merely ASIC-resistant**

>**For any particular computational problem, hardware specialized to solving specifically that problem will always be more efficient than general purpose hardware.** In addition to the advantages of writing application-level logic directly into the circuitry, specialized hardware does not need to be burdened by other requirements of general purpose hardware, such as security isolation, clock interrupts, context switching, and other tasks required to support multiple applications. **Thus, no proof-of-work algorithm is ever ASIC-proof, merely ASIC-resistant.**

>Empirically, ASIC-resistant algorithms have repeatedly failed to prevent the development of ASICs. Prominent examples include scrypt (LTC), equihash (ZEC, BTG), ethhash (ETH), **and cryptonite[sic] (XMR).**

So the takeaways from this are:

1. If we want to have accurate, objective pricing information, we must use fair value to levelize the supplies between different coins, and to remove false price influences like Tether, whale movements and the fact that exchanges price all coins in BTC, which allows BTC the uncanny ability to move and negatively affect the entire market. 

2. ASIC-resistance is and always has been a fool's game. ASICs are a natural progression of cryptocurrencies that have grown sufficiently in size and popularity, and 'resisting' this move is a form of **arrested development** akin to 'puberty-resistance' or 'potty-training-resistance'. Its just nonsensical. 

In order to make money in cryptocurrencies, we have to keep our heads on straight and not be swept away by popular opinion without good cause. ASIC-resistance is a red-herring that does nothing be destroy the value on your chain. Luckily, most communities like ZCash, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin accept and understand this basic fact.

I'm toying around a bit with crypto to get some hang into it, and I have a question about stop losses and sell orders. 

I noticed that if I buy 1 BTC for 8K, and set a sell order for 1 BTC for 9K and set a stop loss order for 1 BTC at 7.8K to ensure I do not lose more money should it dip rather then rise, I get the message ""Insufficient funds"".

This is because the 1 BTC will get ""reserved"" for that specific sell order at 9K.   
How is it possible to set a stop loss and set a order to sell at what I believe, will be the highest point? 

I also noticed the word ""Leverage"" with the options ""none, 2, 3, 4 and 5"", what does that mean?",1573197856.0

While 500K in volume isn't much, I think it's worth saying that I have a feeling that these DEX projects will be rather successful coming next bull run (Probably by next year) since a TON of people will FOMO in to buy. The interest for protecting privacy has been increasing for a long long time, and lately a lot of DEX projects have seen the light of day.   
Binance did one, which sadly isn't a ""Real"" DEX, but they knew people would demand it, so they made it.   
Ever seen people complain about KYC? Complain about trading histories from Coinbase shared with the IRS? It kinda makes sense to use a DEX if any of these issues concern you.

While Bitcoin attracted other growing cryptocurrency companies in succeeding years, it captured a significant number of investors and traders around the world. Now, millions of people already earned from crypto trading, and there are still hopefuls trying their luck in trading. One of the best ways to limit the risk of the volatile trading market of cryptocurrency is to be good in decision making and having the right knowledge about trading. The best way to do so is through reading, there are millions of [crypto trading books](https://kucoinblog.com/top-10-books-on-crypto-trading-part-2-sk-rd) that are just waiting to be studied.  


*Mastering the Elliot Wave: Presenting the Neely Method by Glen Neely & Eric Hall* is one of the most recommended books a crypto enthusiast should read before trading. The book explores the Elliot Waves and how they can be used as indicators of market trends. Elliot Waves are a concept developed by R.N. Elliot in the 1930‚Äôs and at its most basic can be thought of as a way to predict the psychology of large groups of people. He had developed his wave theory in response to the current idea of the time that stock markets were chaotic, random and unpredictable. Elliot claimed people traded in repetitive cycles and that his formula could illustrate the patterns inherent in these systems. Despite some of his detractors‚Äô unease with the intuition associated with his method, Elliot made complete, accurate predictions of market movement.  


Another book a crypto trader must-read is *the Fibonacci for the Active Trader by Derrik Hobbs.* Considered to be one of the [top crypto trading books](https://kucoinblog.com/top-10-books-on-crypto-trading-part-2-sk-rd) by most articles. It introduces the reader to this mathematical concept developed by Italian mathematician Leonardo De Pisa in the 13th century. The Fibonacci Sequence can be represented as a series of numbers in which each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. This sequence can be carried on ad infinitum and has some very interesting qualities. Hobbs explains the way that this sequence is used in trading clearly and concisely, making this text great for new traders, or anyone that has never incorporated the Fibonacci Sequence into their approach. Hobbs lays out the basics of different tools such as projections, extensions, and retracements and the purpose the Golden Ratio can play in their implementation. The collection of knowledge from these two books is necessary for crypto enthusiasts to survive the volatile world of crypto trading.",1572445704.0
