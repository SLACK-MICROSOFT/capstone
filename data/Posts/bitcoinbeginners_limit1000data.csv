My husband used to help me with tech issues, but he passed away earlier this year.  I never store bitcoin in my Electrum, but have used it only to sweep and spend/send bitcoin that I keep in paper wallets, so my Electrum is empty.

Is it possible to just upgrade my current Electrum or do I need to uninstall it and install a newer version of Electrum?  Uninstalling it presents a problem because I do not know how to uninstall software.  

One possibility that I've been considering is to install a new Electrum wallet on my late husband's laptop computer under his name.  We share the same IP, so will Electrum still allow me to create a new Electrum that will work independently of my now obsolete Electrum on my desktop PC?

Ill be grateful for any guidance.",1575155309.0

I'm an absolute beginner to blockchain. I was trying to understand if there is a relationship between hash power and probability of winning a block. If I have more hash power, does it mean I have a higher probability of solving a block, therefore winning 12.5 bitcoins ?

 More broadly, if I take part in a bigger mining pool that collectively has more hash power compared to a smaller pool, does it mean I'm more likely to win  bitcoins in the pool with higher hashing power?

Is it a smart idea to wait for a big high, sell, wait for a dip and buy again (and repeat) or would this be a bad decision? Is it possible that we see such volatility for the next months or years or do we expect a more stable price in the near future?

Total Output**1.57434876 BTC**

Fees**0.00022607 BTC**

So it looks like they sent 1.57457483 and the fees were .00022607 but yet I only got 1.15870265. So where and how would I just lose the rest?

Example: digital vs written on paper

- digital can have extra layer of encryption

- digital is smaller and more convenient 

- digital is not an obvious secret/password

- thief can make a picture of written phrase,  not knowing somebody stole your seeds

- someone not tech savvy, will find your bootable storage device useless as he can't read it in windows/mac

- thief that doesn't know anything about Bitcoin, will still make a picture of your seedphrase and find it out on Google. 


Then there is the argument of digital storage not ideal for long term.

I've first heard about bitcoin when I was younger and decided to explore that mysterious place I heard about called ¨dark web¨. Found many services there on sale for bitcoins, and upon some researching, found that 1 Bitcoin was worth just above $100, and people were asking for several of those. Seemed like really high prices for me, but I just shrugged it off as some darkweb gimmick. 

Fast forward a few years and I've been always thinking how I should have just gotten some back then, and how I missed all chances for investing. Well, this is gonna end now. My closest contact with bitcoin was a couple years ago on WebSummit, where a company was giving away tiny amounts of BitcoinCash if you installed their app. Other than that, I have a bit of understanding on how the blockchain works, and that's it.

What I'd like to know now is this:

* How do I set up a bitcoin wallet ( And im assumit the wallet is where you can keep your bitcoin, and spend it, sort of like an online bank account )

* What are the best wallets to use ( there are some lists online, but with limited knowledge it's hard to judge ), and how can I ensure anonymity if I desire to?

* How can I request bitcoin payments?

* Any other resources to help me get started with bitcoin, payments, keep track of btc value, other coins, etc.

At the moment I am using the blockstream green wallet, which I really like, interface wise etc. but I want more security. 
I will keep this wallet as a spending wallet with small amounts and have most of the Satoshi's transferred to a ""hodl for life wallet"". I want to set up an electrum wallet in Ubuntu while offline and delete it afterwards, only keeping the seed phrase. 
On my android smartphone I will set up a Watch-only electrum to keep track of it. 

So here's the plan:

- Create a new wallet with electrum, on Ubuntu live(offline) 

- Write down the seeds and keep secure

- Write down a couple public adresses

- Set up watch-only on the android app(online)
 
- Delete the wallet on ubuntu(or just shutdown Ubuntu live) 

Receiving funds should be easy, just send an amount to a public adress and I can verify it on the app.(will test a small amount) 

Sending funds (which will happen rarely), but I will test with a small amount:

- Create electrum wallet using seeds, in Ubuntu live (offline) 

- In the electrum android app I set up a transaction (online), I copy this to usb

- I load the transaction on my electrum wallet in Ubuntu live (offline) 

- I sign the transaction(offline), copy back to usb

- Load the signed transaction in the android app and send (online) 

Is this gonna work? Any tips, suggestions? 

There are probably more secure/advanced ways to do something like this. 
But although I've used linux/Ubuntu years ago, I'm still a beginner. 
And regards bitcoin/blockchain just started out getting in depth about a month ago and the more I get to know about it, the more I realise what a legend Satoshi is.

Edit: Another side question, if anyone finds out your seed phrase and gets access to your wallet, but won't transfer any funds, will you find out somebody had access?

Thank you to those receptive to helping the bitcoin communities troubleshoot along their journeys and assisting beginners finding their footing.

I've recently become interested in bitcoin again. I knew my way around using them several years ago but was never truly proficient in more advanced applications or understanding why what I was doing was working. Recently I've decided to decipher the ins and outs of this tool. Many things appear to have changed since my last occasion with the Bitcoin world.

Where I am:

I understand that cold storage is an absolute must, if I intend to hold larger quantities of bitcoin, or bitcoin at all for any length of time. Okay. So I'm trying to make sure that I am doing this right this time. I'm sectioning out bits and pieces of the aspects that make bitcoin work and trying to understand. I understand that wallets do not hold actual bitcoins, only the ""key"". There are alt coins now! How intriguing. Those were not so wide spread last I was peaking into this world, so many questions.

Questions)

1. Can I have Bitcoins sent to a cold storage account? In, that, if I create a cold storage account can someone else transfer bitcoin to that cold storage that I've set up (on a USB), like a friend transferring coins as a gift, or someone sending a payment for a purchase.
2. Where is my wallet actually? And where are my bitcoins actually, since my ""wallet"" is my key? I'm imagining that a wallet is two parts, the key that I can retain and the other half something stored on the major commonplace bitcoin network that everyone uses. Perhaps the blockchain?
3. Is it a correct understanding that my cold storage wallet address will have to be recreated every time that I actually use the key and access my coins? At that point the wallet is no longer secure and I must create a new one and update my public address (that allows me to receive coins as gifts or payment? I can learn to do so if that is the case, however is there a more stable option for the address. An address that will last longer and not have to be replaced as often? Or am I misunderstanding this?
4. Any help in finding resources to set up a USB wallet for Bitcoin? Yes, I am aware of the hardware wallets like Trezor, however I don't actually understand why those are ""more secure"" than a USB wallet or a paper wallet. I do understand why the cold storage hardware wallets are more secure hot wallets. As in, I don't really know the companies that make these hardware wallets, and I'm not quite sure how they work, so at this point it seems like I'd be putting random trust in a group of engineers without really understanding it. In all honesty I'd still like to use my own USB that I've set up myself, but it also seems like a good way to understand and compare and contrast what goes on with Trezor wallets ( and similar hardware wallets). They seem pretty much like a usb stick that has been converted to single purpose. I've managed to make linux usbs and encrypt my own harddrive. It can't be that hard to set up a USB that will securely serve my needs.
5. Can I put more than one wallet on a USB?

Pointers are appreciated, and thank you for reading.",1572487179.0

The process of key creation is very secure because, given a public key, it is practically impossible to come up with the corresponding private key.

With the current computing resources we have, it would take an extraordinarily long time to find the correct private key. Assuming that a classical computer tested a trillion keys a second, it would take up to 1.09 x 1019 years to guess the correct answer.

I am considering starting to invest in bitcoin, but I need some help with some basic information.

First, bitcoin is a blockchain which is a random code of numbers and letters that represents the bitcoin transaction.  Is that correct?  If not, what is it?

When you ""own"" bitcoin you have one of these aforementioned blockchains(if that is the right term) secured somewhere.

You secure the blockchains in wallets which can be physical hard drives or apps that store them for you.  Can you simply write down a blockchain to ""save"" it?

To get the blockchains into a wallet you purchase them at an exchange, and then you transfer them from there to the wallet.

the 1W ""Vol 20""in the shaded area he is referencing is ""389.245K"" on TV. Does that mean 389.245K Bitcoin were traded or $389.245K USD was traded in that timeframe?

Obviously a similar amount of trading in BTC terms would mean a much lower total in USD terms, as BTC has gone 20x since this time period.

Lightning is still a project in its early days, but the privacy topology  of lightning payments is much more ideal over on-chain payments if you  have the choice. Routing large amounts can be uncertain, but for small amounts the  network is becoming steadily more reliable. Currently Wasabi does not support in-wallet lightning features, but it  is on the road-map.*

 I originally registered with Coinbase about 2 years ago and was to make a few purchases of Bitcoins back then with no problem. Recently I came across a need for coins once again and tried to use that account. I was able to login and update the banking info and add a debit card but was still not able to make any buys. I closed the account and tried to make a new one using the same name but different bank info I have and a different email and ran into the same problem even after verifying my identity.

I contacted support and they forwarded it to someone higher up but at the end they were unable to fix the problem or enable buys on my accounts. They were also unable to give me any information as to the reason why.

Anyway no problem I thought by now there must be competitors out there. I registered at CEX.io and was unable to buy coins because I couldn't verify my identity because they don't support New York. Same problem with Coinmama my state is not supported.

I am most definitely a beginner with buying and such and all terminology so forgive me if I misuse any of the lingo. Is there a trustworthy place/exchange that works in New York State where I can can buy Bitcoin using fiat money? Bank account or Credit Debit doesn't matter.

This is not troll or anything, please hear me out.

I was just offered a job at a bitcoin company. It is a part time overseas job.

My job goes some thing like this:

1. Customer from my country buys bitcoin
2. Customer transfers money to MY BANK ACCOUNT
3. Company sends me...information (?) about customer's purchase
4. I withdraw money from MY BANK ACCOUNT and go a bitcoin atm in my city to...buy bitcoin I guess? I'm supposed to do something with the information the company sends me.

So...what is this? Is this a real kind of job?

I looked up the company, I think they are real.

Also my salary seems to be sort of commissioned based. It comes as a percentage off the customer's purchase.

Please guys I need your thoughts on this. I don't know alot about bitcoins.

Thank you in advance.

\[Edit\]

After reading everyone's comments, I have declined the job offer. Thank you everyone for reminding me why common sense is a a thing. I must admit when I first got the offer I was happy because I was applying everywhere and didn't get any response. 

For anyone wondering, I did actually do some research on the company before writing the post, but I didn't think it look to suspicious. The only real things I could find was a linkedin profile and page from [opencorporates.com](https://opencorporates.com). I saw that the company had about 2k USD in assets and 2 listed directors.

Did anyone have a problem crossing the airports checks with a hardware wallet? What should I say if some officer wants to check it? Is it dangerous if the officer takes the hardware wallet to somewhere I cannot see, if he doesn't know the PIN code? Are there specific regulations in Japan?

I'm traveling in a group and I don't want to hold the rest of the group waiting for me.

It's really good that Trezor supports multiple passphrases. I'm planning to hold $100 on one passphrase, and the rest of my funds on another passphrase. If some officer asks how much money I have ""on the device"", I will show him the $100 account and tell him that I'm only experimenting. It's also good in case someones tries to rob me - he will only get my $100 and wouldn't imagine that I have more. Japan is also a very safe country to travel and the chances to get robbed directly are extremely low.

If hardware wallets are a problem, I can always load a small amount to an app on my phone just for the trip, but I don't like doing that. I'm a hobbyist app developer myself, so I switch my phone to ""Developer Mode"" a lot, which shuts down many of the native defences in Android.

What about equipment for running lightning network nodes (and watchtowers)? Will the market be conquered by companies with expensive specialised equipment? Will ASICs, or some other expensive and specialised hardware, give a significant unproportional leverage?

Obviously cheap electricity also makes a huge difference, like in some places in China. I also understand that there are other reasons for running your own lightning node, to reduce your own transaction fees.

It’s easier to say that for $1 they can buy 10 kilo-satoshi . We should start talking about the price of a kilo-satoshi. It’s really cheap these days, one kilo-satoshi costs only 10 cents. Maybe a kilo-satoshi will be worth thousands of dollars one day, like Bitcoin had.

Then I noticed that I have a new bitcoin address to receive bitcoin. After some reading, I learned that this is used for privacy - so other people would not know your transaction history (If you had only one address, people could see when it received coins and how much).

Furthermore, I've learned that when you spend from an address, software/hardware wallets will send all the leftover funds to a new address that is managed by wallet. This is good both for privacy (hiding your transactions), and for security: the private key of the address that you spent from was used mathematically to sign the transaction, and the transaction was broadcasted online so in theory it is mathematically easier to break it (plus, unless you're using a hardware wallet, the mathematical signature was calculated on your computer and could have left logs or other artifacts, etc.).

What happens if someone sends me bitcoin to the address that I spent from? For example, if I published my address on a website to receive payment/donations, someone sends me bitcoin, I spend it but forget to update my website to publish a new address, and then someone else sends me more bitcoin to the old address.

Could it automatically ""bubble"" to the newer address in the chain, like the leftover bitcoin from the old address? Will bitcoin support in the future a transaction that says: ""Send X bitcoin from A to B, send the leftover to C, and from now, for every future funds that A will receive, send them also to C"" (sorry if I don't use the technical names correctly).

**I want to know if I have to buy BTC outside of coinpayments and send it to the coinpayments wallet.** I placed my order with the vendor and the website that auto-refreshes + gives me the address to send to is using a coinpayments.net URL.

At the end of the month, you have to physically go to a bank/money-exchange and exchange many of your large notes to cents, quarters, etc. so you could give change to future customers. Obviously this exchange has a commission, etc.

Most customers wouldn't mind if instead of small change money you give them a small paper note with two QR codes, and tell them that you've loaded a bitcoin paper wallet with X Satoshis - that are currently worth the exact amount of change they should get (obviously if they have an existing wallet you can use it instead of the paper-wallet). Large change money should be given with large notes - I'm talking only about the remainder.

For annoying customers that demand their legal right to receive small change (I'm not sure what the law says about this in every country) - you can give the change in the smallest available coin in your country (i.e. give the change in single cents), and tell them that you don't have any other larger coins :)

Transferring the bitcoin to the paper wallet doesn't even have to be fast. It just needs to be very cheap. It could even be aggregated to a single transaction (i.e. if you manage a busy coffee shop, make one transaction after every 10 cups that you sell, to multiple addresses).",1568187400.0

Wouldn't it be a major economic problem in 10-20 years from now, if nobody knows how many bitcoins are actually in circulation - how many private keys are lost and how many bitcoins are just hodled?

Would it be a bad idea to change the blockchain code so that if a certain wallet did not spend any bitcoins (i.e. its private key was not used) for \~25 years, its balance is deleted/blocked?

I know that this is considered to be a ""fork"" and would make many people here angry, but if we convince the majority of miners (of mining power) to accept this rule, even if this convincing would take years, it will make bitcoin much better in the future.

However, as the article points out ""Except for some edge cases that are rare and rarely have a significant impact on revenue, this simple and efficient transaction sorting algorithm maximizes miner feerate revenue after factoring in transaction dependencies.""


One edge case that particularly worries me is when the opposite of CPFP occurs: let's say the mempool is almost empty and I make a transaction that pays 1000 sat/B, then a child that pays 999 sat/B, then a child of the child that pays 998 sat/B, then a child of this child that pays 997 sat/B. Using the simplistic algorithm explained in the link above, all childs will be ignored for the first block. After the parent is mined, all childs except the first child (now the parent) will be ignore in turn. This will lead to the last child being confirmed much later than it should be, in a situation with almost an empty mempool.


My question is: do the current algorithms in use by miners, for choosing which transactions to be included in the next block take into account this edge case? Or they fail to maximize the miner fee in a case like this?


I could experiment and see for myself what the result is, but I hope someone has some insight into this.",1567815109.0

&#x200B;

I'm not certain if this is the right place for this type of post! Please let me know if there is somewhere more suitable if not. 

&#x200B;

I have recently downloaded and got running Bitcoin Core (Windows machine) as a full node, incoming and outgoing connections and verified the whole block chain. 

In addition to setting up Core, I downloaded and installed Electrum Wallet and used Chris Belchers guide on Github to turn it into a personal server, everything running via my own node. 

My next intention was to download and install Lightning Labs Ln daemon andall was going well until I tried to set up my lightning wallet.

It seems that the wallet feature in Bitcoin Core needs to be switched OFF for you to create a Lightning Wallet for Lnd BUT if I switch off the wallet feature in Bitcoin Core the electrum server feature no longer works as the Core Wallet is used to ""Watch"" the electrum wallet.

Is there a way around this? Can I have Lightning up and running with a separate Ln wallet whilst still using electrum as a personal server? 

&#x200B;

If not, what have people found as a good setup on Windows for apps sitting on top of bitcoin core?

I was thinking something along the lines of Core with Samourai personal server and Lightning or would that have the same issue as above? 

Maybe Core and Lnd with Zap as a front end? Could you run a Samourai server with that enabling access to both samourai wallet and your Ln wallet via Zap? 

&#x200B;

People say you should hold because BTC will become the currency of the future, it's capped at 21 mill, so it will increase in value like gold (limited supply) etc, but what happens when the whales decide enough is enough and the only way to make a final profit is to sell all their BTC and crash the market? I'm not talking about minor pumps and dumps, but the endgame, be it in 5 or 10 years down the line, or more. 

You could say that by that time, the currency will be mass adopted, but how it can be if it's so volatile? And the main reason it's so volatile is because of the big whales that are pumping and dumping constantly, speculating. It's a vicious circle.

I am completely new to cryptocurrency.

Someone contacted me privately and advised me of an exchange that's much easier to deal with and no headaches or fees - they just hold your funds in an escrow wallet and release them once you've deposited. It sounded much simpler and also since the processing is almost instantaneous I wouldn't have to worry about fluctuating exchange rates (for example just in the time I was trying to figure out how to cash out my value had gone down by £30).

In hindsight I know I was stupid but the person who messaged me on here painted themselves as a simple suburban mum who had been through the same headaches and hassles and wanted to save me the trouble. Furthermore, the email address for the exchange was very responsive and seemed very professional; they always got back to me within a few minutes regardless of the time.

I sent my first amount to them the other day and was informed the bank transfer would take 3-5 days but should be expected today. They also created a private wallet for me using Mycelium in case I want to have an intermediary place for my BTC.

This morning I wake up to an email saying my bank rejected the transfer and that they would need to lock my account while they investigate but that I need to lay low and they'll be in contact with me in 7-10 days. They also advised me to use the intermediary wallet they created for me in the meantime.

I messaged the redditor to be like shit, has this happened to you before, and lo and behold she had sent me a message I didn't see yesterday saying her boyfriend caught her flirting with me and deleted her account. I should have known something was up once she started getting weirdly flirty with me but I figured whatever. Now I'm 90% this is a scam as the email address has also been deleted. They did say my account would be blocked but that they'd be reaching out to me in 7-10 days.

I feel like such an idiot... This stuff is so confusing to me. I'm going to switch to epayments with my job, I'd rather the fees than this hassle and having to worry about exchange rates, but in the meantime I've seemingly lost several weeks' worth of payment from my part time job.

411,Knowledge check,10,cs1hqb,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/cs1hqb/knowledge_check/,16,"I understand that most analogies that attempt to explain blockchain/bitcoin will be inherently incomplete/flawed since the technology is so new, but I still think they are critical for new participants to get a grasp on what’s happening, at least for me personally.

Hoping to get some help as I am having trouble synthesizing a few concepts:

* Transaction fees
* Private/public keys and digital signatures
* Sequence of events
* Order in which transactions are recorded
* Mining nodes vs non mining nodes

My understanding is that all transactions are broadcast to the network. Initially I thought the distributed ledger was analogous to 4 individuals playing monopoly. Instead of having a banker, each player writes down whenever a transaction takes place. This particular analogy lead me to believe transactions were recorded in real time (a player shouts out their transaction and immediately all players record the transaction).

Learning about the proof of work lottery required me to tweak my understanding a bit. (Except in the case of forking) I gather that only one individual in the entire network is mining a block (recording transactions) at any given time? Not sure if this is true, but assuming it is, that person records transactions in time sequential order (or so I thought). Somehow a public and private key are involved here: I decided a public and private key are analogous to a username and password (I think this is grossly over simplified). Anyway, providing the password that corresponds with your username allows you to conduct transactions (digital signature). There is some validation of each transaction before the transaction reaches the miner (mechanisms here are unclear).

As stated above, I was initially under the impression that the miner is recording transactions in time sequential order, but then I remembered transactions fees. This lead me to think of transaction fees like bidding on eBay: the higher transaction fee you pay moves your transaction to the top of the list. Therefore transactions are not recorded in real time.

When your block is full (is there a certain GB limit?) the network validates that everything checks out. You get a lil piece of the action (deposit of transactions fees and a reward for mining a block into your wallet). The proof of work lottery begins again.

Two unanswered questions remain:

1. Is the proof of work lottery “paused” while someone is actively mining a block?
2. I have become exposed to the idea of mining and non mining nodes... what exactly is a non mining node? Someone who conducts (and validates) transactions but doesn’t play in the proof of work lottery? Or just pretty much everyone who owns bitcoin but is not set up for mining?

Very grateful to anyone who can check my understanding. Most of what I've learned comes from the ebook [Inventing Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/Inventing-Bitcoin-Technology-Decentralized-Explained-ebook/dp/B07MWXRWNB), [this Hackernoon article](https://medium.com/hackernoon/bitcoin-miners-beware-invalid-blocks-need-not-apply-51c293ee278b) that dives a bit deeper into validation, and this [3Blue1brown Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4) that provides a high level review of foundational concepts.

I understand that you need to store you keys offline as thats the safest possible option, however I wanted to know if there is a cheaper option than the ledger or trezor. I've seen that there are some app wallets that store the private keys in a ""encrypted space in the storage of the device"", however I don't know if the private keys are actually safe with these wallets.

Also what is a good exchange, coinbase is shit as they don't actually give you the private keys and they charge fees. As just a trial I bought £2 of bitcoin and then transferred to the coinbase wallet. When done I was left with £1.35, 65p or 32.5% of the initial investment was lost (I don't know if this gets better with larger sums, but even so this is bad). And again I don't get the private key in the end meaning that they still have it.

SO... TLDR:

A) Are there any cheaper alternatives to ledgers that are equally as safe, I.E. the private keys are stored offline.

~~B) What exchanges can I actually get the private keys and then transfer them to a wallet.~~",1566083525.0

Coinmate seems a lot smaller, and have no app as far as I can see, so I would need to use their webinterface in my phone browser.

I'm not exactly new to bitcoin, but never took the time to learn or buy it. So I spend the last week reading this sub, watching some videos, some blogs, etc.

I plan to buy BTC soon, so I want to have a hardware wallet, after seeing a lot of your answers I decide for Trezor, but I noticed they have two different versions, Trezor One and Trezor Model T.

In the [Security Protection](https://trezor.io/#comparison) comparison, Trezor One relies on your PC/Mobile, is that safe? I don't like the idea of touch screen of the Model T, I think a simpler hardware with buttons seems more durable and resistant. Should I worry about that security part?

One more doubt, I see the majority of people talking about Coinbase Pro to buy BTC. At the same time I see some people complaining about it requiring your personal info, is there any good alternative for Europe? Or even with the need to give them your info, Coinbase is still the best?

As mentioned mine is out of sync by over 3 years and I don't think my shitty laptop will be able to download all of that, so is there any alternative option? Or have I misunderstood this slightly?

&#x200B;

For long term storage, is BRD or Blockstream Green for iOS ""just as good"" as a Trezor or a Ledger Nano?

My thinking is this:

\- Generate mobile wallet via BRD or Blockstream Green on iOS.

\- Transcribe the seed words on paper/metal. Store this somewhere safe, etc.

\- Fund the wallet.

\- Delete the wallet app from the iOS device.

\- To access the funds in the future, enter the seed words to a fresh installed version of BRD or Blockstream Green for iOS.

The sources I've read so far, explain that the hashes miners are trying to find start with a bunch of trailing zeroes. The amount of zeroes determines the mining difficulty. The algorithm's goal is to maintain an average block time of 10 minutes. In this example we have, let's say, 8 trailing zeroes. The average block time drops to 9 minutes. The algorithm adjusts the difficulty to 9 trailing zeroes. However, this makes the hash **orders of magnitude** harder to find. Therefore the average block time wouldn't adjust to 10 minutes, but to 15 minutes (for example, i'm just making the numbers up).

I can imagine that this is an extreme over-simplification of the hashing algorithm and difficulty adjustment. Can someone ELI5 (or rather ELI15) how my reasoning is wrong, and the algorithm is able adjust the block time with a precision of minutes, instead of tens of minutes?

&#x200B;

edit: Additional question: i just found that the signature of block 100 (in 2009) only had 8 trailing zeroes, and the current blocks have 18 trailing zeroes. I can only imagine the difficulty will be increased with future higher hashrates and efficient miners. Would it become a problem if these signatures had like 30-40 trailing zeroes, because the signatures would 'run out'?",1564176650.0

4. What are Merkle trees hashes made from?

5. The reason we use a merkle tree in bitcoin: We use a merkle tree because it combines all the data in the block and gives us a header hash. If any data changes in the tree, the merkle header will change. We do the proof of work hash including the merkle tree hash. If any transaction data changes, the header hash will be not be valid. The header hash requires the proof of work which takes time to make. So it is key in proving that the data has not been manipulated.

I am intensively learning about blockchain. I was wondering if you could hook me up with answering some questions I have gathered.


1. Alice tries to double spend. Alice forks the chain. In the examples provided in this situation, its always the forker fighting against all CPUS. So as long as the forker does not have 51% its OK. I understand this. What I do not understand, is, the chain with the most blocks are accepted, why, if Alice forks, do the other nodes not trust her other fork, why does Alice have to mine independently. The first transaction could potentially be only a few seconds ahead in time. If the first transaction is only ahead in a few seconds in time, it is possible that it might not be the longest chain.  

2. If I have the hash, digital fingerprint of a block, what can I return with it? Data?

3. There are a 100,000,000 transactions in the mempool, how many transactions will go in a block? At what point does something say, this block is full, let's start working on its hash. 


4. How does a miner decide how many transactions to put in a block?

5. Where is the blockchain information stored? On a node?

6. Do I understand correctly that only 1 node will get a reward of 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes? If this is the case how does anyone make predictable money with mining? By grouping up and combing power, but then also splitting the reward?",1563893957.0

***Not only do I want to be a dull user of Bitcoin, but I want to know exactly what happens when I mine, store and spend BTCs in the end.***

&#x200B;

The first questions concern the mining of BTC.

By mining, new blocks are found. The lucky one will be paid around 12 BTC for this. So far so good.  


The first question would be in this regard, **where exactly the Bitcoins come from?** **Are these simply generated out of nothing? Or are they somewhere in a pool ready?**   
**Or is it just algorithm which specifys how many blocks can be mined in total. So the amount of the rewards is going to be halfed every few years.**

&#x200B;

**Mining only confirms or finds new blocks. right?** This has nothing directly to do with Bitcoins in first. right?   
That's just the reward for the work that has been done.

So when i send a BTC from one wallet to another, the transaction is going to be stored in one pool with all other transactions that has been done in a certain time. After the miner has done his work, he confirms all those transactions and stores them in the block at the end of the blockchain. correct?

&#x200B;

This also results in the second question:

How the blockchain works in the rough and is structured, I understand slowly. **But how can I physically imagine bitcoins?** I know there is a private key and a public key. The private key is physicaly stored in my wallet which gives me access to my box where the bitcoins are hidden. **But how does 1BTC or 0.0001 BTC exactly look like in my wallet?**

**Are bitcoins just a series of numbers that are sent back and forth, or is there more to it?**

I hope i dedcribed my questions clearly and i'm looking forward for your help.

I would be grateful for a detailed explanation of this. 

I will give my rough understanding and maybe someone can fill me in on some of the (many) holes in my knowledge.

I have a basic understanding of hash functions. I somewhat understand how as the blockchain is built, it takes a huge amount of computing power basically ""guessing and checking"" to get an answer (under?) a certain value, and when this happens a new block is added to the chain. I get how nodes in the network only need to trust the longest chain. I'm guessing one reason for this is that if you built some other false chain, the blocks would not have this special mathematical hash-based relationship with each other? And if an attacker tried to add to the existing real chain with false info, they would need to have the majority of the computing power in the network to keep their chain the longest. 

I don't understand how adjacent blocks are related to eachother other than that their hash inputs are based on the hash of the previous block. What exactly is the math behind this?

I've been reading posts and watching videos, but one question I haven't been able to answer yet is whether the Lightning Network support ""parallel routing"" (for lack of a better term).

Let me explain with an example.

 - Alice opens a channel with Bob, each put in 0.2 BTC.
 - Bob has a channel open with Charlie, each with 0.1 BTC
 - Alice also has a channel open with Dan, each with 0.2 BTC
 - And finally, Dan has a channel open with Charlie, each with 0.1.

Like so:

    + 0.2 - 0.2 B 0.1 - 0.1 +
    |                       |
    A                       C
    |                       |
    + 0.2 - 0.2 D 0.1 - 0.1 +

(Hopefully that makes sense)

My question is, can Alice pay Charlie 0.2 BTC as a single transaction?
In other words, If Alice wanted to give 0.2 BTC to Charlie, would the Lightning Network (or the wallet software) give 0.1BTC to both Bob and Dan, and have each of them pass on 0.1 BTC to Charlie for a total of 0.2?
I can certainly see it being possible as two separate transactions, but I'm not sure if it could be done in a way where it would be ""all or none"" like a single transaction would ensure, as opposed to there being a chance that 0.1 BTC is paid without the other half going through.

I noticed you are able to attach a message when you transfer an amount from wallet to wallet. 

How “secret” is this message? Is it encrypted in anyway, or can anyone who is having their network keep an eye on a certain coin also simply read the attached message as the coin travel from one wallet to the next?

If the message is “hidden,” you could essentially use the transfer of the smallest amount as an e-mail service, free from snooping. At the very least, if your wallet isn’t in your name, the messages would be anonymous sent and received, even if someone could read them.

665,Advice for people new to cryptocurrency,2,c978bc,BitcoinBeginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/c978bc/advice_for_people_new_to_cryptocurrency/,9," So I have been fairly interested in cryptocurrency for a while now and I want to go about owning some as well as contribute to the community with helpful information once I understand the basics. I would also like to get familiar with transferring funds from various exchanges to hot wallets to cold wallets to swapping currencies without much risk (starting with a small amount) and with minimum fees.

Since I am just hoping to get my feet wet with the crypto world currently, I am not trying to go all out investing everything I have but rather spend 5-20$ on most likely bitcoin first so I can feel comfortable with knowing the basics in what to do and where to go. I will most likely use coinbase first since I reside in the US and I have already set up an account and am familiar with their platform.

The main thing that concerns me is taxes, I would like to understand how to keep up with them and when and where I would file for them when capital gains or capital losses come into play (don't want anything to backfire at me in the future or to upset our lovely friends at the IRS). I understand you get taxed when:

\-you trade crypto to fiat

\-trade crypto to crypto

\-use crypto for service or goods

\-mining (which I don't see myself doing soon but it makes the list)

Tracking crypto transactions is another concern of mine as for I know that you have to keep track... for taxes. I can go old fashion and write them down but that might seem kind of annoying after a while, use excel maybe? Or use a crypto tracker, but if I do not have much money in it, I don't see myself purchasing a service. So I would like to know the easiest way to go about tracking transactions as well.

If an exchange is centralized and abides by aml and kyc, does that make it more secure? Some say you should use a decentralized exchange for crypto to crypto, is it any better, lower fees or something? Also Is it good to have funds diversified in a couple of wallets (seems more secure since if something happens to one, you have a couple others. A couple cold wallets for long term investment, and a couple hot wallets for short term use). Any helpful information would be nice.

So to summarize most of my questions:

What is the best way to go about tracking transactions?

How would I keep up with taxes, where and when would I file losses/gains, do I have to file every transaction or can I file a total loss/gain for the whole year?

Is it better to use decentralized exchanges like bisq or centralized like coinbase for crypto to crypto and for crypto to fiat and vise versa?

Secure exchanges with minimal fees?

Do I need a multisigniture wallet for more security?

Any other fees besides a miners, transactions and maybe transfers I should know about?

Anything else I need to know? Some extra advice would be greatly appreciated.",1562300542.0

I dont know if this issue is just pertaining to me as I have deleted and re installed the mobile app and used the desktop site as well but still same issue. 

When I go to send coin to another wallet I have realized the hard way that the wallet is calculating the miners transaction fees wrong as in drastically to low. This issue first started happening to me about 3 months ago. I would send coin to another person or site and select the wallets auto calculated ""regular"" or ""priority"" fee. I never really paid attention to the fees because they were on average $0.45 for normal and $0.85 for priority. Out of the blue I started getting complaints from people that the coin I sent handnt confirmed and it was 14 hours later. I thought it was just an issue with the blockchain but then it kept happening. I would send to a site and would be waiting upwards of 15 hours to get 3 confirmations on a $100 transaction. I sent support tickets and only got generic responses such as ""we have no control over when your transaction will confirm."" That wasnt even my question. I decided to take a look at the walkets custom fee option and that's when I figured it out. When you select custom it will tell you what a regular and priority fee actually costs at that specific time your sending coin. The reason my transactions weren't confirming was because blockchain wallets automated fees were sooo much lower than what the fees actually should have been. For instance today it said the fee for a regular speed transaction was $0.18 but when you click on custom it tells you that currently the regular fee is $1.25. My coin wasnt confirming because I was unknowingly sending way to little of a fee and no miners were adding it to their blocks to confirm. As soon as i started using the custom option to send my coin I started getting 3 conformations in as little as 10 minutes. Has anyone else had this issue or noticed how far off blockchains auto calculated transaction fees  are compared to what the actual fee is at that time??",1562219889.0

There are 1000's of independent bitcoin developer's right?  Ton's of companies that hire these techies to develop bitcoin code.

What I don't get is:  Bitcoin works (maybe not that great at times).  It's been out there for 10 years now.  I sent a transaction 6 years ago that went through.  I sent a transaction a few weeks ago that went through.  The GUI and background and blockchain explorer's haven't seemed to change for me all that much.

So what does a bitcoin programmer do exactly?  My best guess so far is they all just work in their own little sandboxes and these companies have their own ""instances"" of bitcoin running with bots or whatever.  Then, in there, they can change code, update, fine tune, etc.  and show their results to the world after the fact...never really influencing the ""real"" bitcoin in real-time.

I thought changing bitcoin code and updating and fine tuning wasn't possible with bitcoin unless EVERYONE made the same changes at the same time.

Can someone help me out here?

Specifically I've been looking at the Ledger Nano S so I will base my questions on that model and manufacturer.

&#x200B;

* What happens if my Nano S breaks or gets lost, will I be able to backup my wallet with my seed on any other wallet(hardware or software) or do I specifically have to order a new Nano S? Have ledger said anything about that, seeing as the bitcoin slogan is to hodl the coins, there is a chance that the hodling outlives the model. Would be a shame to loose the entire wallet because the Nano S is not being manufactured any more etc.
* How does the hardware wallets work more in depth? I get they keep the wallet offline, but is there any burnt in keys in the wallet it self which I would need to recreate my wallet? Are every Nano S the exact same internally, blank only based on the seed I give or is there some hidden key or factor? If all Nanos are not totally dependent on my seed, can you trust Ledger, maybe they bail out or get hacked like a lot of online exchanges and such? Could then people try to brute force all seeds and get every single wallet kept in a Nano S?
* Are there any concrete cons of using a hardware wallet? The only thing I find is that they cost some money and are a bit of a hassle to use compared to software wallets. But are there any other not so obvious cons?
* Is the Nano S open-source? Can I find the schematics and the code somewhere? Do the hardware and software have some peer review or some one from the outside explaining how safe they are? I get they can be hacked through MiM, but I'm more interested in the hardware itself, or the wallets being generated by the hardware.",1561746614.0

I've been part of the bitcoin community since 2016 (I watched it for a year then eventually bought some in 2017). Since then I've learned a lot and followed several Reddit subs about bitcoin. The general theme for supporters of bitcoin is HODL, Too the moon, etc. (This is what I've done exclusively. I have not made 1 single transaction using bitcoin. I've only bought or sold BTC).

My long probably multi part question is this...

For bitcoin adoption to grow, we need to use it right? If that's true, then, for me, HODL doesn't seem entirely accurate. 

For those who really understand the bitcoin ecosystem, do you have a strategy about how you use and HODL bitcoin. In other words, do you HODL a certain percentage and use a certain percentage? Do you have one wallet for transactions and one for investing? Essentially, what's the best strategy for actively participating in bitcoin as an average user (not miner)...just for us average people who can understand how to use a wallet, buy, sell, and use bitcoin for everyday needs. Finally, does it really even matter if I use it? Should I just HODL it and not worry about whether actively using bitcoin does or doesn't further its cause?",1561586133.0

I am in need of some help as I am quite new to bitcoin.

I have completed multiple transactions and never had this problem so I am unsure of what has happened.

I purchased bitcoin from my usual website and transferred straight into to my electrum wallet, the transaction is just sitting there reading ""unconfirmed parent \[76.4 sat/b, 4.60mb\]."" The ""4.60mb"" has been moving up and down a little. 

If anyone could explain how to fix this and help me that would be greatly appreciated. I will also link the block explorer link in the post. Thank you

I uploaded pictures of my ID front and back, and a dated selfie of me with the ""For trading on Coinbase"" and all those were approved. I added two payment methods, a bank account and a debit card, both are approved. When I try to buy BTC, it tells Neto add a payment method. I go to the payment methods, and see both are there. I already verified the two deposits and the card, but when I try to buy, it says buy is disabled. Wheni try to deposit cash, it refuses.

I tried this on two phones and also on the web page. Their 888 phone number says it> is for reporting compromised accounts only, so I sent a support ticket, and have not heard back. 

I tried Robin Hood as a backup, and it appears to be ready to let me buy, but reading elsewhere, it looks like they dont allow crypto buys in my state. I don't want to send Robin Hood money only for it to get stuck there.

I have a few ATMs in the area, but prefer Coinbase.

Has anyone experienced this weird issue with Coinbase, or do you know if Robin Hood actually does sell in this area, or are ATMs going to be best? I have no objection to showing ID, as I have no illegal or dubious plans, and no need for privacy.

If I cannot fix Coinbase, are ATMs are likely best for me, or what are other Coinbase like routes to buy? Kraken and Binance were even more tight, they each rejected half a dozen ID verifications due to minor issues with the photos. Is there a low cost (probably not Paxful) route to buying coins?
