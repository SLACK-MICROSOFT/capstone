Maybe 20 each taking about 2200w. Just doing my initial research and from my understanding it's tough to get enough power for this without creating some kind of stress on the grid, possibly giving a reason for utility company to shut the power down in my end. I was just wondering what is a best route to avoid this kind of situation? Does installing a transformer help in this case. If so how expensive is that? I live in WA, USA. Thank you.",1575168827.0

6,#OneBitcoinCar #OneBitcoinFreedom,0,e3zxh8,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e3zxh8/onebitcoincar_onebitcoinfreedom/,4,"Only 3.5 years ago Bitcoin was about $420/btc. At the time, just as play money, I decided to buy one bitcoin for myself, one for my mom, and none for my dad. He refused because he thought Bitcoin was a fad. This is separate from my cold wallet. In Nov 2017 when bitcoin was worth $17,000, my mom badly needed a new car and using that one Bitcoin I bought her a brand-new car.  She was ecstatic and proud. I was happy I could help her out. It was her first brand-new car. (sadly, my dad got nothing) A brand-new Honda Civic was her #OneBitcoinCar.

I really like the new Tesla Cybertruck. It really excites me. It is expected to be released in December 2022, and it’s gonna cost about $56,000 with options, taxes, and shipping costs to Germany. I put my play bitcoin order for that much. Let’s see if it will get executed by Dec 1st, 2022. If so, it will be a $420 Cybertruck for me. So please have your fingers crossed, and set your reminders for Dec 1st, 2022 for #OneBitcoinTesla. 

Today I sold my VW golf for about 8k. I plan to buy one bitcoin with it and put it aside as house money. Once mass adoption happens and we can buy everything with bitcoin, I will buy a luxury house with it. #OnebitcoinHouse

Some of you may ask how I am gonna get to work without a car. I am glad you asked. Funny thing is I had also bought one bitcoin as freedom money. Recently when bitcoin hit $12,000 I decided to quit my job and travel for a year. #OneBitcoinFreedom

Bitcoin represents freedom for me. Freedom from central banks, freedom from government wars, freedom from monetary devaluation. Buying Bitcoin also gives me the joy of being able to support an ecosystem that reduces governments’ ability to demonetize their currencies. Here is looking at you India, Venezuela, African countries and the all mighty former USSR. The cars and houses are just a bonus.

13,"Discussion: Are ASIC's, Exchanges/Futures/Leveraging/Tether, Letting governments dictate BTC the way to go?",1,e3z2vv,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e3z2vv/discussion_are_asics/,5,"So let me make this very clear for everyone.. I have this feeling that ASIC's cause mining pool centralization. CPU's can do the same thing ASIC's do. Buying bitcoin as an investment instead of a monetary revolution. Exchanges/Tether price discovery. Letting the government take part of BTC's destruction in the long run. Let me explain. 

Wasn't the goal of Satoshi to have 1 person = 1 worker? Wasn't BTC created so everyone could take part in the network? Why is it that BTC went from minable on CPU (for an everyday person) to minable on ASIC's? Well the answer is actually fairly simple.. Because the developers decided it would be a good idea to let people make more and more powerful machines as the difficulty went up to have the market all for them and the early adopters of BTC. Instead of taking an approach like Monero is doing... Going back to the basic's. Letting the people rule. 

CPU's could do exactly the same thing ASIC's do. Problem is... Until the code of BTC does not allow this, the more BTC mining will be centralized because who in the world has the money to buy ASIC's and even profit from it??? You know who? Early adopters of BTC, countries that don't have high electricity cost. And then you all want to talk about adoption.. That is the funniest shit i have ever heard. Adoption is made when people arnt forced to do something 1 way. ""Investing"" and getting dumped on for example. And DO NOT even get me started with the whole ""Its the electricity that goes into making BTC that dictates its future price"" That is complete BS. Bitcoin could be at 20k dollars with CPU mining just based on network difficulty... if the code allowed it. 

The biggest problem with all of this? Now most people (certainly after the havening) will be forced to buy bitcoin with cash, which is then considered an investment. Who is going to trust the centralized pools to not absolutely dump all mined coins on the market and crash the price? Or trust the Tether cartel that currently dictate the future of the WHOLE cryptocurrency market?

You know the other problem with BTC? People that thought it would be a good idea to let BAKKT and CBBE trade futures contracts with money printed out of thin air! BAKKT has yet to prove they have the BTC. People that thought Tether was good for BTC. This leads to complete manipulation of the market. When all of this can be integrated into the code and be avoided! Bitcoin developers could of made an on-chain, built-in, exchange for price discovery.. But NOoOoOo Let the exchanges screw everyone over with their manipulation using the #1 enemy of BTC... Fiat.

Last time I checked. Satoshi didn't make BTC for people to absolutely ruin it for everyone one day. Satoshi made BTC to fight against government corruption. Fight against the top 1%. Fight against unstable FIAT. Fight against inequality. BE YOUR OWN BANK! Where in the hell do you see in the WhitePaper him saying ASIC's will rule over Bitcoin? 

PS: This is not a rant post because i lost money or anything... I still hold BTC. I am just starting to question certain aspects of BTC compared to other developments in the crypto sphere.",1575160463.0

We all know the story by now. One of the reasons is we don't put our money where our mouth is. With tens of millions of people now are supporting Cryptos but the portfolio is still too small comparing too the market size. We could potentially flip fiats with just the community we have now if our portfolio reaches 30-50% in Cryptos. This does not mean you have to risk your life savings with Bitcoin or Ethereum. It has been 10 years and we will be welcoming the year 2020 very soon with our friends and families. Let's think about how we can increase our portfolio to potentially flip fiats to cryptos. Only 2 scenarios:

\- You support fiats and we all know the outcome of central banks, governments and the 1% 

\- You support cryptos and we know we can change the outcome of nearly 8 billion people

So what will be your proposed solutions to get the mainstream to adopt Cryptos while we increase our portfolio to flip fiats sooner rather than later?",1575118265.0

He offered me a cut and I thought to myself ""hey free bitcoin, what do i have to lose?""

So I made an account, nothing fishy so far, then he transferred .001 btc to test. Ok fair. Then he transferred .12 BTC (\~$900) TO MY ACCOUNT.  Still at this point I just thought it was some really stupid dude because after all, the 900$ were completely mine now! Little did I know the scam relied on me trying to scam the scammer.

In fact, I was so engrossed in the amount of free money I had just received, that when I tried to withdraw funds and my account was frozen until I could deposit .012 btc ""due to EU regulations"", I didn't think anything of it. 

I pestered family, friends, and my girlfriend to try to find someone with 112$ so i could claim my 900$! If you're reading this and thinking ""classic refund scam"" then you'd be right! Thankfully nobody was willing to lend me money, so I slept on it and finally realized how deep into a scam I've gotten myself in. 

Overall very intelligent scam; the website was also pretty well made, but the things that set me off was the refund scam of course, the grammatical errors, and the us server location (for a supposedly uk based website) I discovered while doing some research into the server ownership and location.

I have a Trezor and Coinbase (I know, I know). I'm trying to figure out the easiest way to receive crypto on my registry. Is there a way to put a QR code on my wix website, or have a public key number, or an even simpler way? Would love some advice!

[Crypto Pro](https://apps.apple.com/app/id980888073) launched back in 2015 when Bitcoin was priced at $200 a pop, and Dogecoin ranked 7th. We wanted to create a small Apple Watch widget so that everyone can see Bitcoin’s price at the flick of a wrist.

The app has gone a long way since then, and we have the reddit and cryptocurrency community to thank, for giving us both encouragements and constructive feedback to shape what the app is today. So thank you:)

# What is Crypto Pro?

Crypto price / news / portfolio app designed for iOS. Users can see stats like portfolio gains, losses, and other cool analytics. As well as set price alerts, read news, connect to your exchanges and wallets. [Here's a link to check us out](https://apps.apple.com/app/id980888073)!

# How are we different?

We are the only major cryptocurrency app that keeps all the user data on device and doesn't track or analyze it in any way. We believe that privacy is important, and that no one should have access to your portfolio size, market viewing habits, or API keys. Everything is encrypted and stored locally on your phone. When you delete the app, all your data is deleted… the way it should be. (but we have an option to backup to your own iCloud or Dropbox account if you want to).

We also think the design is pretty cool tbh. We got some nice sparklines going, cool charts, real-time pricing, and a bunch of other cool features. Here’s a few pictures I put together with a sample portfolio > [https://imgur.com/a/acj0l67](https://imgur.com/a/acj0l67)

# What should I comment?

Feedback on the app is always appreciated :) or comment the year you first learnt about Bitcoin, or your price prediction for December 2020, or some just some random gibberish ಠᴗಠ.

Happy \[belated\] Turkey Day!

I would like to test some algorithms to assemble a candidate block and also do some statistical analysis. In order to do this, I need an example of the mempool transactions. However, I wasn't able to find any simple way of downloading it. My best attempt so far was to download the data from the blockchain.info API accessing this link: [https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions?format=json](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions?format=json). However, I think the number of transactions is limited by 10 and usually the mempool has more than 10 thousand transactions.

The only solution I found so far was to install bitcoin core, download the entire chain (which I want to avoid) and only then be able to get the mempool transaction data.

1) Seller cannot keep the BTC without delivering the product

2) Buyer cannot reverse payment after getting the product

The protocol I envisaged was ( I have limited understanding of the BTC wallet mechanisms )

Say Alice wants to sell oranges to Bob safely for X BTC

1) Alice and Bob create a special paired wallet with the following properties:
It has two addresses WA and WB

You can only transfer BTC into WB from Bob's wallet

You can only transfer BTC out of WA into Alice's wallet

There is a special transaction that Bob can do (say transfer 0.0 BTC) that moves all the BTC from WB to WA

3) Bob sends X BTC into WB

4) Alice delivers the oranges

5) Bob sends 0.0 BTC to WB

6) Alice transfers X BTC out of WA

  

The only way anything malicious can happen is if 

1) Alice is a sociopath who wants to waste Bobs money, makes him lock up BTC and doesn't deliver oranges (despite the fact that she cant use that BTC) 

2) Bob is a sociopath who wants to waste Alices money, makes her deliver oranges, but doesn't unlock the BTC (despite the fact he cant use that BTC)

  
I was pointed to this article https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Zero_Knowledge_Contingent_Payment

One of the most useful applications of this is to buy BTC for cash safely and securely and for people to sell goods P2P without needing any escrow service

My question is - is there any wallet or client that allows this in a simple manner? - if not why isn't it there!",1575049854.0

&#x200B;

Hello, my name is Joe and I'd like to share our story how we worked for LAToken and they have

*scammed us* for our referral cut.

&#x200B;

First of all a year ago I was working as a listing manager at Worldcoretrade, a new crypto exchange,

which was recently closed, sigh.

&#x200B;

The exchange has been developing very slowly and their management was very weak so I decided to work on other exchanges in order to list the existing clients and find better commissions. I had a few clients and many connections who were already listed at Latoken, so I decided to give it a try.

&#x200B;

That's when I got connected with Valeria Fedorova, Latoken listing manager.

She promised golden gates and diamond roads, considering the commisions they charge (from 5 btc up

to 17 btc per listing).

So we launched an independed website and started promoting their listing offers.

A few days later, they have offered even better solution – IEO, initial exchange offering, which promised about

25% referral fees for a 8+ btc listing cost. So basically we worked for 2 btc commision for each listed

client.

One of my initial clients that was first listed at Worldcore Trade has accepted their offer and arranged a

listing. This happened 1 week (!) after the service proposal in January and we had this client since the

beginning of Jan 2019. You can check their news so it's clear – first they got listed at Worldcore, then at

Latoken.

But somehow they have not told me anything about this client while I was suggesting other clients I

have introduced, sometimes they were saying – don't communicate with them, as they are already

negotiating our offer. Frankly speaking, I was confused with such reactions, but well, we have just

started, so I tried to respect their ongoing issues and did not interfere.

But this client (TOKENMOM exchange) was our client with many other directions, not just worldcore.

I personally did communicate with Bobby Ong at Coingecko and managed them to get listed there. I

was keeping the communication with Valeria and once we suddenly found out that TM is running IEO

at latoken, I contacted her. In response she told me that I don't have any proof that TM has been listed

with our assistance.

&#x200B;

Thats when the shady actions have started, with very easy explanation I'll be posting below.

Communication via e-mail and TG did not bring any success so I decided to give it a try at their

meeting held in Europe. So I gave them a visit and first attempted to talk to their “ceo” Valentin

Preobrazhenskiy. He was mean and rude, forwarding me to Valeria, and she was trying to hold me busy

talking while the attendees were watching us arguing for a while. After a 30 minute talk, she said that

they will FIND A SOLUTION ON the following Monday and it's all good – just to contact them on

Monday via chat. So I did, but when I contacted them, she said that the listing was done via a local

representative and I need to sign some agreement (after 6 months of work!) if I want to work with

them!. I was amazed but decided to find out more about this.

&#x200B;

So finally I discovered after talking to another local rep here that local representatives get WAY lower

commission, it's not even close to 5%. This perfectly explained why they scammed us.

Now, when I contacted them in live chat, they reacted to this instantly promising that their support will

contact me. Afterall Valeria got FIRED for that event held which I visited. I figured that she was fired

because I came into the event and somehow compromised the reputation which is ruined anyways

already way before this. SO Valeria got fired just to cover this scam and they have lied again – no

support has contacted me, however, when I asked again when they will contact me, they have banned

me from the chat.

&#x200B;

Latoken is being run by russian cons, that thought that i'm an English speaker, so I can't really influence

the primary origin, however that was a big mistake because I do speak Russian fluently and do have a

lot of stuff to say about their scam.

&#x200B;

Please see the attached screenshots, proving that TokenMom has been our client from the very

beginning of January 2019 and that LAToken scams every listing agent, because of the fee difference –

they just forward the tokens to their local representatives and save 80-90 percent of the commissions

promised.

I also have some chat screenshots with Valeria where someone from her account (she is fired,

remember) is asking me questions such as who I contacted and explaining that she left the LA herself.

So I suppose these shitbag liars will continue scamming others as they are definitely used to this and

that's their primary goal – **stealing the funds from listed tokens and listing managers.**

They faked the volumes so bad, that they can't even keep the exchange in one piece – it's falling apart

now, considering the feedback you can see in their live chat – many people got scammed recently

including the account holders (delayed withdrawals, changed passwords, etc)",1574922052.0

When bitcoin becomes more sought after, more miners try to mine more, and do so in part by increasing their efficiency.

Can you guess the lynchpin here?

Bitcoin has massive security which is the driving force behind its own feedback loop. No other coin comes close to achieving this property. This is why it’s so important to keep the blockchain small. It’s the other variable in Bitcoin’s security equation.

I own BTC, but all the same I'm wanting to solidify my investment thesis/reasons for owning BTC. I'm playing the devil's advocate here so hopefully someone smarter than me can explain this.

HYPOTHESIS:

Bitcoin will never be a dominant currency because it is too risky for Fortune 500 companies to use. A major company would have to keep billions of dollars in a bitcoin wallet and, presumably, several people at the company would have the keys in order to send payments to vendors and so forth. A Fortune 500 employee with the keys could easily send lots of BTC to a personal, anonymous wallet through coinjoin or some other anonymizing application. The company would have no recourse in this situation.

I still believe BTC is a great tool for individuals, but I don't see it becoming a primary currency for day to day transactions. Someone please explain/prove me wrong.",1574902313.0

I don't really know that much about Bitcoin and got a question, I thought this might be the best place to ask about this.

So I'm planning on finally getting a VPN and have been eyeing Mullvad, which seems to be a very trustable and anonymous Provider. Upon Account-creation you just get a number, that's your whole account: no username, no email, no nothing, just that number. That means not even they can connect your identity with your account.

The only thing that might connect the account and your identity is the payment. To be FULLY anonymous it wouldn't be smart to pay by bank transfer or with your every day PayPal-Account, but luckily they offer to pay with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

As far as I know Bitcoin is just pseudo anonymous, as you can trace back every transaction to the wallets it came from, and at one point in time you had to create an account somewhere with your personal information to even buy Bitcoin in the first place.

Which brings me to my question: Is there any way to stay fully anonymous the whole way, buying and sending Bitcoin?

There are services like [anycoindirect.eu](https://anycoindirect.eu) where you can buy Bitcoin etc. and send them directly to an address you'd like to. (In this case I'd send it to the payment address for the VPN)   
But to do that you have to create an account there with your personal information yada yada yada.  
I guess they have one address where they keep their Bitcoin and send it from this address to wherever. Would this be directly traceable to ones account? Or would this step make the payment of the VPN untraceable to my accountdata on their site? 

Before there arises suspicion: I don't wanna do some highly illegal things, don't worry haha. Most illegal thing would maybe be some torrenting from time to time lol. I just want to be sure that there is no way I can be traced by paying and using this VPN.

Well before I write a whole book I'll keep it at that..

you shouldn't trust your exchange with more than you're changing for your monthly needs.  

time to make your own wallet, maybe even invest into hardware wallet if you have more than you can afford to loose. 

do your own security research and do it now. multiple articles on the net on how to secure coins properly. don't wait for ""proof of keys"" day, do it today. exchanges are not bank accounts and not there for you to store your wealth.

10,000 Satoshis = $1.00 USD

1 BTC = $100,000 USD 
1000 Satoshis = $1.00 USD

1 BTC = $1,000,000 USD
100 Satoshis = $1.00 USD

So this summer/fall 2019 we were bouncing around a value of about $10,000 USD. This put us at the 10,000 satoshi per USD point. 

In order to be able to speak about things in satoshis, (or really any unit of currency) people need to have an idea of what the value of that unit is.  A satoshi will never be equivalent to 1 USD, and for a satoshi to be referred to like USD cents would require a BTC value of $1,000,000 USD... which is possible but very far off if it ever did happen.  I think that in order to use the subdivided values of BTC it would be helpful to have a better way of talking about satoshis.
 
So let's say I want to sell a book online for $20 USD.  Currently if I wanted to sell that book for the equivalent value of satoshis... (lets say for ease of illustration that we use the recent value floor of 10,000 USD) then the listed price is going to look something like:

""Bitcoin Book -  20,000 SATS""

Just in terms of initial point of perception, 20,000 seems like a high number.  If we could standardize using a unit of 100 SATS with a catchy denominator, this could make prices look more like this:

""Bitcoin Book = 200 cSATS""

To me 200 of something is a manageable value. But this is largely because I am used to USD or Euro standards. One would ideally like to match up to standard denominations used by people day to day, so there might be an instinct to use some unit which creates the most analogous crossover to say, dealing in 10s and 100s like USD/Euro.  But many other countries deal in denominations of the 100s and 1000s... so setting the cutoff at 100 satoshis might make the system recognizable in both types of native economies.

Also...using the 100 sats denomination as a base unit of value also means that bitcoin can be explained to the uninitiated as ""Every bitcoin is a token for 1 MILLION cSATS.""  One million is a simple, easy to remember, and easy to conceptualize number for most people.  This means it can transmit faster as a meme.

Edit: Apparently there is already a name for this (100 satoshis), but I dont think ""BITS"" is great.  Its too easily confused with such a common computer term.

Edit2: Let's call it a centi-satoshi, then we can use ""cSAT"" which is normal enough, but then soon people will start to call it a ""cat"" for short because internet people love cats.

Edit3: Maybe kilo-sats... kSATs?)



Tl;dr: Let's normalize talking about 100 satoshi units of value, and find a catchy/memeable name for it.",1574861003.0

A: You can use your Mastercard Prepaid Gift Card anywhere Mastercard is accepted - that's millions of locations worldwide from retail stores to online, mail and phone orders. You can also use your card to pay bills online. \[[source](https://www.bitrefill.com/buy/prepaid-mastercard-eur-european-union/)\]

Today I decided to buy bitcoin, I've been reading about it for a long time and I finally decided to make my move. As I know, not my keys not my coins, I'll be moving them to a desktop wallet - Electrum, but before that I have some questions. I appology if some of this questions are ""dumb""

1 - Why Electrum only uses 12 seed words? I thought the standard was 24

2 - Once I get my wallet, can I get an adress that I can use multiple times? One adress that whenever I buy from an exchange, I deposit to my wallet without having to go to my wallet get another adress. My ""plan"" is to once I get that adress to use multiple times (if thats possible) I will unistall everything about Electrum so my wallet doesn't get compromissed.

3- Is there a way to watch the balance of my wallet? On the phone for example 

4- I heard that u always have to have your Electrum wallet updated. What does this mean? What happens if I don't

5- What happens if Electrum ceases to exist? Will I lose my coins? Can an Electrum employee see my seed? Why/why not?

It gives a great idea on cost, Revenue, Margins, EBITDA to mine Bitcoin. (Figures in Canadian Dollars.)

**Summary: **
$4.4K cost to mine = $11,353,029 /1950 btc = $5.8K CAD * 0.75 CAD/USD = $4.4K

*If including other expenses;*
Site operating: $11.35M
Depreciation: $4.7M
Expenses: $1.4M
Net finance expenses: $1.1M
Total = $18.6M/1950 = $9.5K CAD * 0.75 CAD/USD = $7.1K USD

Short-term if the price goes under $7.1k they will keep mining as this is still > operational costs & mining equipment is a sunk cost. But long-term you can’t imply that they are profitable <$5k. They will need to replace equipment, continue paying employees, financing costs, etc

Many people in Ukraine who have no connection to blockchain and cryptocurrency area, are aware about Bitcoin. One time I was returning from crypto-conference abroad and when taxi driver asked me where I've been, it happened he is also Bitcoin enthusiast and a trader. I also know a barman-trader, who is working full time in a bar and trades in a free time (and even had some kind of a fund). So no wonder that topic of Bitcoin entered many areas of life, especially art and creative industries, and in this short article I will focus on cinema. 

Ukrainian cinema nowadays has its Revival. Many films are created, from different genres and for different audiences, and now we see that Ukrainian movies are more viewed in cinemas, while in past cinema-market was dominated by Hollywood blockbusters and Russian shitmovies. Some films win prizes at international festivals. 

While the quantity of films is still much smaller than in other countries, I know at least 3 films which mention Bitcoin topic.

&#x200B;

**Just Sex, Nothing Personal**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTBM7T0cpZI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTBM7T0cpZI)

Genre: Comedy

Release date: December 20, 2018 

Director: Olga Ryashina

Production company: Star Media

In the beginning of the film, girlfriend leaves Serhii, the main hero of the film, saying that he is ""just an accountant"". - ""But I also deal with crypto"" - he responds, but this doesn't affect her decision as she claims that he is complete 0 in sex. 

Serhii goes to Prague for New Year to visit his friend, and meats a strip-dancer in a club, then falls in love with her. His ex-girlfriend was humiliating him in past, but as the time passes, somebody asked her if she saw the price of Bitcoin. She checks the price and understands how rich is her ex-boyfriend now, so she decided to return him and marry. 

Even though Bitcoin is small episode in this film, it's not even depicted in trailer, but it really shapes the whole story. 

Taking to account date of release, it could be real story a year before in 2017. 

We don't know if Serhii made millions or just some smaller amount, but it's enough to implement into life dream of his new girlfried ex-strip-dancer, to start a restaurant-cafe in her home city Lviv in Ukraine.

**Foxter & Max**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhRmC8hHdGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhRmC8hHdGk)

Genre: Comedy for children

Initial release: September 19, 2019

Director: Anatoli Mateshko

&#x200B;

Timid 12-year-old schoolboy Max finds a can of nano-paint, and draws graffiti - dog. Unexpectedly drawn graffiti comes to life and turns into a nanorobot with super powers - a combination of biotech and AI. This nano-dog Foxter helps Max in life, but both of them are hunted by a dangerous criminal who wants to take possession of this powerful technology in order to mine cryptocurrency and hack, withdraw cryptocurrencies from others' accounts to his. Well, as usually in comedies - there is happy end.

**Nightmare Director, or School # 5**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFqfX3Wivn4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFqfX3Wivn4)

Genre: Comedy

Release date: October 31, 2018 (Ukraine)

Director: Mila Pogrebiska

&#x200B;

The story is about ex-prison manager who in order to return to his previous job has a challenge to be director at problematic school. Unlike first 2 films I didn't watch it, as it was in cinemas not for a long time.

But Bitcoin topic is mentioned in trailer. 

At 00:55 you can see the criminal who is asking:

\-- What is Bitcoin, do you know?

\-- Yes, composer

So this short dialogue references to the popular joke (hard to say does this joke has more truth or joke in it) when people mix Bitcoin with Beethoven, music composer.  (Well of course now in certain communities people know what is Bitcoin, but don't know who is Ludwig van Beethoven)

Then (at 00:59) criminal asks ""Did you mine a lot already"" and we see a torture scene. 

&#x200B;

All 3 films are very recent - this year and previous, and of course there might be other films which I'm not aware about. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will be depicted more and more in the mass culture. And this is just one more small proof of it.",1574798744.0

472,Node best practices,19,e1m6q2,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e1m6q2/node_best_practices/,13,"TLDR: How do I manage my small node for personal use?

Recently I set up a BTC/LN node using Raspiblitz. It was a lot of fun getting it to the point it is currently at but I have a few questions that I couldn't find out by doing my own research. Mostly my questions at this point are on your personal opinions rather than how to's.

My privacy is important to me but I'm unsure just how private I need to be. Sometimes I think I'm just paranoid or being overly cautious when I need'nt be. I set up my node to connect via Tor because I worry about things like my ISP knowing what I'm using my bandwidth for and potentially throttling or disconnecting my service. I live in the US so this concern might be unwarranted. I also worry about people seeing my IP on places like 1ML and finding out who I am IRL. I have to remind myself that I probably don't have enough money for someone to go through the effort of using this information against me. So I'm stuck wondering if its worth routing over Tor at all.

I only need two wallets. A spending wallet and a savings wallet. The savings wallet should be on hardware when I eventually get one. My question is do I have a reason to connect my hardware wallet to my node at all? I'm only planning on sending TO my hardware, never from it (at least for many years). I didn't see a lot of guides on how to connect a hardware wallet to raspiblitz so it honestly seemed like it was not common to do it.

The spending wallet should be on my phone so I can make purchases regardless if I'm away from home or not. I saw a few guides on how to connect Zeus and Zap to the node even over Tor with various tactics like DynamicDNS and Orbot. Someone mentioned that DynamicDNS defeats the purpose of routing through Tor anyways so maybe it's not worth the hassle? Is it possible right now to have the best of both worlds or at least a reasonable balance between privacy and convenience? I also like the idea of being able to manage my channels when I'm away from home as well but this is less important.

My next concern has to do with routing. I understand the fees I could potentially gain by routing transactions are almost zero. That's fine, I'm not doing it for that, it would just be kind of cool to see something show up on my forwarding history and know that my node helped someone make a payment. Obviously I could never have as much capacity as ACINQ or one of the many online casinos but my (probably misguided) understanding is that I could still be helpful if I balance my channels properly, if not now then possibly later on when lightning gets more usage. Does anyone have any thoughts or resources on managing smaller capacity channels? My plan for balancing is to just buy something using a channel with bitrefill or foldapp so that I have in-bound capacity and using autopilot for outbound channels. Is that a good plan? Questions I've been wondering are things like ""who should I connect to as a peer?"", ""how do I choose who I open channels with?"", ""is it better to connect to the big nodes or with smaller nodes like myself?"", ""are there any privacy concerns I haven't considered when opening channels or connecting to peers?""

Sorry for the wall of text. I just generally like to have things organized and a lot of that is learning all of the options and how to weigh them. Thanks in advance.",1574742745.0

**Description**:

Compile and run Bitcoin full nodes, lightning nodes, and user-friendly web-apps that help abstract the complexities of Bitcoin. This book not only explains the tools and techniques to help readers build their own banks and banking apps, but it also tells a story. Starting with the origins of Bitcoin—what it is and why we need it—find out what its strengths and limitations are. Understand the nature of mining and why so much energy is put into it.  The blockchain itself will be reviewed, as well, and compared to other options such as a normal SQL database or a simple spreadsheet.

With this book, you can control Bitcoin wallets via RPC commands on a Raspberry Pi. Configure, compile, and run two implementation of the Lightning Network-compatible daemons: LND and c-lightning. And employ user-friendly web apps that abstract the complexities of Bitcoin/Lightning-Network.

The Internet of Information is currently transitioning to the Internet of Things, which in turn may well  be followed by the Internet of Value (or Money). However, there is no evolution without happy users and Bitcoin will never reach the same heights like the original internet without having offered “useful” and “easy to use” tools. Just like nobody would ever want to use UUCP to send messages via web the same applies to current cryptocurrency tools. These are hard to use and very unforgiving. But, the evolution doesn’t stop here and many easy-to-use tools are already available. We will meet some of them when building apps for the Lightning Network, a new technology running on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain that makes it possible to generate billions of transactions within a single second.  ",1574733940.0

Or a private key per transaction or what?


2) If someone were to randomly guess recovery words, it is basically impossible to crack a targeted wallet, but what about a random wallet, which could have some funds in it...

How likely would someone crack any single wallet by randomly guessing words (estimate a probability) ?

3) As more people open wallets, I assume the length and complexity of words are increasing. How often do wallets share some of the same words or 11/12 of the same words ( or 23/24)? 

4) How are the words created? I'm guessing some algorithm, how is it so that no one else knows the words?

My name is Giacomo Vico.

*I had to delete the other posts after ""advice"" from Bitwala.*

https://preview.redd.it/z34o5jo22t041.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=59589c7f028382f9e2e40e8c49b749330be32ac6

*I am writing this post to warn everyone. So you won't have to go to what I went trough.*

Let's start with the **background of** **Bitwala.**

Bitwala is directed by three managers **Jörg von Minckwitz, Jan Goslicki and Dylan McFadyen.**

The **same three** operated a company called **All4BTC**, which many of you may remember.

&#x200B;

To understand the truth about Bitwala and All4BTC we must understand the structure behind.

The three managers in 2013 funded *Bits & Coins Consulting UG*. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/pftmh7vdwrcipqe/gruendungsurkunde\_bitcoinsberlin.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pftmh7vdwrcipqe/gruendungsurkunde_bitcoinsberlin.pdf?dl=0)

**All4BTC was a “Bits & Coins Consulting UG” project**, as it is clearly stated here. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ywd272czj78b7nd/vertrag\_2013\_juli.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ywd272czj78b7nd/vertrag_2013_juli.jpg?dl=0)

One year later, on the 25.09.2014, they also funded an ""anonymous"" company based in Holland, under the name of *Safaru BV.* [https://drimble.nl/bedrijf/hengelo/30629985/safaru-bv.html](https://drimble.nl/bedrijf/hengelo/30629985/safaru-bv.html)

Then in 2015, Jörg von Minckwitz and Jan Goslicki founded **Bitwala GmbH.**

Taking a closer look, we see that **Jörg von Minckwitz,** **while** being Managing **director of Bitwala,** was the **head manager of All4BTC** until 17.08.2016, when Dylan McFadyen took his place.

Then on the 24.11.2017, Martin Mischke became the head manager of All4BTC replacing Dylan McFadyed, which became Senior Manager in Bitwala GmbH.

Lastly three years later Bitwala GmbH became the sole manager of Safaru BV. [https://drimble.nl/bedrijf/hengelo/30629985/safaru-bv.html](https://drimble.nl/bedrijf/hengelo/30629985/safaru-bv.html)

&#x200B;

**ALL4BTC**

All4btc was a service that lets you pay for anything using Bitcoin.

The platform was technically very easy to use: you pasted a link of what you want to buy, then enter it into the website. You enter your shipping details, then checkout with bitcoin and track your order.

Indeed during the brief life of the company a **huge number of users** hardly complained that they paid for orders, but no items were ever received. **Funds recover was impossible** because customer service stopped responding.

Some user may already find some similarity with Bitwala at this point.

*In any case in the* ***link below*** *you will be able to find all the* ***depositions of previous users*** *that ""lost"" their funds with the* ***All4BTC.***

[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7s7wao82qqt2ry/AADG7U8\_kaTwwhLwvmpHjGT3a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7s7wao82qqt2ry/AADG7U8_kaTwwhLwvmpHjGT3a?dl=0)

&#x200B;

***After increasing claims,*** *from All4BTC users, Jörg von Minckwitz, Jan Goslicki and Dylan McFadyen,* ***decided was time for fresh air.*** *They interrupted soany activities with All4BTC  and continued with Bitwala GmbH.*

&#x200B;

**Bitwala GmbH**

Bitwala technically is a platform that allow you to obtain a German IBAN on wich you can deposit EUR and then directly buy BTC. Moreover they provide you a  multi signature BTC wallet. *We should specify that ""multi signature"" means that the user does not have complete control over his wallet.*

So, here you will be able to find **all my case** (Ref.25506) and **twenty nine others more,** of people like you, that lost all their funds with [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/).

[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kqf0lhcri9i70qq/AAAKLz0B-\_v2MI-3BpH5zQVwa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kqf0lhcri9i70qq/AAAKLz0B-_v2MI-3BpH5zQVwa?dl=0)

**Just nine of those** people openly declared their losses, but just from this group the amount of funds lost is **twenty nine thousands and nine hundreds Euros.**

**So how works** [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/) ?

**Forget** about Bitwala, in reality you are dealing with a german bank named **SolarisBank** AG ( VAT ID: DE301501229 ). Your bank account opened with [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/), is under their control. Bitwala, as stated by their costumer agents, cannot influence any decision regarding it, also the freeze of your funds.

*Here below my deposition made with the Finacial fraud department of the Berlin polizei.*

>"" Giacomo Vico, myself, on the 15.10.2019, registered on Bitwala and made a **first deposit from PayPal**, for two thousand euro.The deposit was credited and everything \*seemed very good.\*  
>  
>After Giacomo Vico sent one thousand euro to his Kraken account, the London-based biggest and most regulated crypto exchange.  
>  
>On the 16.10.2019 other **four thousand and five hundred euro were transferred** from Paypal to Bitwala.  
>  
>The same day the **account was blocked.** No warning or explanation.Immediately I tried to stop the second deposit, but it was too late. Emailing instantly Bitwala, a support agent named Brianna, told me that they had no responsibility over the bank accounts, and every decision about them was taken by their bank partner, **SolarisBank** AG.  
>  
>*This last part is extremely poor explained on their website.* [*www.bitwala.com*](https://www.bitwala.com/)  
>  
>The day after, 17.10.2019, Giacomo Vico requested a formal explanation and provided all the documents proving the ownership of the PayPal and Kraken accounts. \*No answers from Bitwala or SolarisBank.\*  
>  
>So, on the 20.10.2019, after a pile of useless and vague emails, Giacomo Vico **decided to call directly SolarisBank.** He could spoke only with a vague operator, named Jerico, and was **denied** speaking with a manager. The operator told Giacomo Vico that he could *only address his concerns*, about SolarisBank, *through* emailing with their partner *Bitwala*.  
>  
>**However**, in response, [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/) repeated that they could not solve the dispute because they had no control over SolarisBank.  
>  
>In the days after Giacomo Vico requested multiple time to speak with a manager of Solarisbank, but was denied.Stunned by so evident subtle manners, Giacomo Vico, on the 28.10.2019, was obliged to call in his lawyer. Again, SolarisBank was called in order to solve as gentlemen the dispute, but again we were denied speaking with a manager.  
>  
>Therefore, on the 29.10.2019 my lawyer sent an email to SolarisBank formally requesting the closure of the account and the remittance of the funds. Absolutely no answers. After calling them again they repeated they could not speak with us and we should address our concerns to [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/). ""

Consequently on the 31.10.2019 Giacomo Vico's lawyer **opened a Legal Claim** with the **Financial Departement of the Berlin Polizei** against two managers of Solarisbank.

**Only after this** we received an email form SolarisBank asking for an IBAN to remit the funds.

**Despite the remittance of the funds we didn't stop our legal claim. We are seeking compensation and Giacomo Vico's laywer collected all the details of the people damaged to forward the information to the Polizei department.**

As stated before at these Dropbox links you may find all my case, the Berlin Polizei legal notice and all the other cases.

Imagine having the keys to the kingdom and throwing it away because of a price drop from $10 to $8. Everyone who did that would be filthy rich right now if they didn’t sell.

**How do we do it? Get to #RT this tweet**  https://twitter.com/theochino/status/1198766095953514497 and I created this hashtag: [\#GetTheoOnCryptoTaskForce](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GetTheoOnCryptoTaskForce?src=hashtag_click).

New York State is a bit more complicated than the rest of the United States. 

The politicians in New York City need to have their arm literally bend for them to do the right thing. You can have a millions people in the street marching, they will not listen to them expect if the 1700 in the room. *(You can see the room for yourself by following this link* [*http://www.newyorktrue.com/photo-gallery-manhattan-dems-organize*](http://www.newyorktrue.com/photo-gallery-manhattan-dems-organize/) *The people in these pictures are the mover and shakers of New York City politics.

My goal was to have 1 BTC with zero net fiat money invested, so after my sale of the cushion (if/when it happens), I will have completely recovery of my total cash investment, including taxes, and a small profit good for a rainy day fund in fiat. The accumulation was done without any DCA (although I would've liked to), but with some lucky buys at local lows since late 2016 (yes I started then, but being a student had to grind it out), and no actual trading (didn't sell much).

I usually buy BTC every month BUT....

My TV had an accident about 6 months ago which caused a vertical line of pixels to be shut off. It didn't bother my family...BUT, it was always there.

So, I decided to buy a new TV to replace it. Which! in fact, looks glorious, and solves all my problems my previous TV had. Oh, right, Bitcoin.

So, I felt a bit guilty not doing my usual and putting into bitcoin every month. I've kind of lost motivation, I guess? Since I hit my original target. But, quickly set a second goal, which has been much harder to reach.

Many people who own a Trezor have multiple copies of their seed phrase. Now that it is known that the seed phrase can be extracted from the Trezor easily, they use a weak passphrase because it is impractical to use an 8 word passphrase that you have to type in every time you want to use the Trezor. Typing it on the laptop is a security risk since there could be a keylogger. Then they store it next to their seed phrase or memorize it. This is horrible security.

Ledger does this way better. First of all the seed phrase cant be extracted and second the passphrase is connected to a pin. So you can use an 8 word pass phrase because you never have to type it in and you can store it in a safe location separated from your seed phrase.

I really want to use the open source Bitcoin friendly Trezor. I hate shitcoin Ledger but unfortunately their security and passphrase handling is superior to Trezors.",1574627350.0

I was to receive 9,500.00 from a merchant and notice in my wallet I got1.15870265 which totaled 8,472.25. I told them about this and they told me they sent 9,500 and that was the difference in price by the time it got to my wallet. I then looked at the transaction and saw this.

Total Input**1.57457483 BTC**

Total Output**1.57434876 BTC**

Fees**0.00022607 BTC**

So it looks like they sent 1.57457483 and the fees were .00022607 but yet I only got 1.15870265. So where and how would I just lose the rest? I also see on the detail page   below that it seems like other fees went to or at least the difference in bitcoin. I didn't put whole address as I don't think its needed.

Ledger- i was in panic mode I had to download a new software onto my computer and reinstall my private keys and was in panic mode for 20 minutes thinking I may lose access to my coins
After downloading new software onto my computer and reinstalling my private key I was finally able to gain access to my coins 

Overall trezor was much easier and less of a hassle after not having used my wallets for a number of years and I’m currently keeping my coins on trezor and dumped my ledgers. I also have always preferred trezors interface to ledgers

I envision that this system can be exported to various altcoins to become much more expressive.  Given that, for example, the cost of one Dogecoin is far less than $.01 USD, a system of larger codes could not only be used, but could be identified from outside of the system.   I have settled on a system of five digits that is almost always either a US Zip code ( 0.00070601, etc. ) or a unix CRC checksum or some small and readable set of text.

My own personal sigel in this system would (for example) be the code 0.00055882.

It seems to me that DMujS3..... is possibly using a similar coding system which could quite easily be grepped out.

At any rate, I am quite interested in Satoshi Codes, or what I call Advanced Satoshi Codes and would love to start a discussion.  Even though the difference between 0.00011111 and 0.00099999 is financially huge in bitcoin, in altcoins, the cost spread is negligible.  I think that this might also be the best place to have this discussion because the system is currency-agnostic.  Thanks for your time and let me know if this post is in the wrong place.",1574566917.0

To be valid it must be from 0x1 to 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4140.

Is it possible that some randomly chosen (with dice, for example) mnemonic seed is not valid, because it produces not valid private keys? Is there a protection for this?

I know that Electrum can be configured to accept a random list of words (user-generated) and to ignore the incorrect checksum.

What is the risk something to go wrong by using manually selected words (selected with dice and ""Bip39-diceware"" for example)?

Edit: I looked through the documentation (BIP32) briefly and looks like I found the answer:

> In case parse256(IL) ≥ n or ki = 0, the resulting key is invalid, and one should proceed with the next value for i. (Note: this has probability lower than 1 in 2127.)

So, it looks like there is a protection envisioned by the developers. Whew.

Edit 2: Actually, no.

> In practice, this will never happen (the probability is so small we can ignore it), and likely implementations don't even bother checking the condition.

This is scary.

Edit 3: I tested Electrum. See ""I successfully imported invalid Bitcoin private key! #5797"" on the Github page.

Edit 4: It's not a bug, it's a feature.

SomberNight  said on Github:

> Effectively, with what we are doing, some group elements have two representations; while most only have one. Your ""invalid"" key contains a number that is too large to be a group element; but we subtract the group order from it and use that number instead. It's as if you imported the ""valid"" key in the first place.

671,Has Bitcoin failed?,0,e0kzvs,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e0kzvs/has_bitcoin_failed/,24,"First of all I don’t want to shittalk bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Since 2015 I had Bitcoin on my radar and bought my first Bitcoin in november 2017. A lot of the following stuff was already written elsewhere but I want to share my thoughts of the last two years.

A store of value.

Bitcoin was invented as P2P cash system by Craig Wright (nah, just kidding). The whitepaper clearly stated it and never mentioned it as a store of value. So what we need for a cash system? Scalability, and here is one problem of Bitcoin. It doesn´t scale. With 7 transactions per second you cannot build a cashsystem, it is that simple. But the lightning network!! Right now there is only 6 million $ in the LN (capacity) and even that number is shrinking. Besides this low adoption in the LN you have a third counterparty to deal with and it has some technical flaws, ~~recently one guy lost 4 btc due a technical bug.~~ Hence you need a lightning wallet it’s not so easy to onboard nocoiners, most people didn’t grasp a normal btc wallet. So we can say that the lightning network is a technical playground for nerds but the majority of people in crypto never touched it. But back to the store of value argument, it came up as the mempools were full and the transaction fees sky rocked. Instead of saying “We have a serious problem in our system” people came up with the store of value argument and people started writing books about it and put lipstick on the pig with a lot of money theory (Bitcoin standard). But if you just look at the volatility you´ll see that this couldn’t be a store of value. I hate to admit it but even Tether is a better store of value than bitcoin. Only Bitcoins deflationary architecture is an argument for the store of value theory, but the numbers indicate, that people don’t use btc as a store of value or a payment system. They simply don’t use it. There is no adoption and for this reason steam removed btc as a payment option. I see it in my own behavior, why should I spend my btc when the value increases in the future. I don’t want to be the next bitcoin pizza buyer.

Doing the same mistakes twice.

I came into crypto because of the traditional banking and money system. I hate these greedy banksters and margintraders who almost crashed the economy in 2008. And what do we do in crypto? Instead of avoid such mechanisms we copy them. Yay, I can short bitcoin with a 100 leverage on bitmex or lending my coins to an exchange for x amount. The bitmex volume is ridiculously high, it is not directly tied to the bitcoin price but has a huge influence. I don’t want to mention all these scammy icos, ah I mean the new term ieos. And because we have no retail in it, we have no adoption. There are some companies like bitpay who started with a good intent but bottom line is, we have a middleman (again) and fees (besides the transaction fees).

Power consumption.

I think most arguments regarding die proof of work mechanism are not true. But one thing shouldn’t be dropped: the electric scrap. I recently came across some pictures of an abandoned mining farm in china, and they were so awful. The world is facing a climate crisis and we just create more and more scrap for mining our bitcoin. That is not a good thing in bitcoin.

So what is the solution?

Maybe there is none. People will not starting to pay their daily goods with bitcoin (because of the deflation). Most people don´t care about the technology there just in for mad gains. And even if there in for the technology, what happened in the last years? The only thing in my mind is SegWit (slow clap) but the hashwar in that that time was so annoying.

Maybe the cryptocommunity itself is the best thing bitcoin has done. There are so many smart people outside who are now connected and doing great stuff. Perhaps we should go further and leave bitcoin behind.",1574558987.0

Is Bitcoin scarce?  Yes.  

Does Bitcoin continue to improve?  Yes.

Is Bitcoin's price volatile?  Yes.

Do many people know what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works?  No.  

Do many people understand fiat money?  Fractional reserve banking?  Central banking?  No.  

Is the current global financial system still based entirely upon fiat currencies?  Yes.  

Is fiat money backed by anything?  No, not since 1971.  

Is fiat money created from thin air by central bankers?  Yes, by the trillions.  

Is excessive ""money printing"" a form of theft?  Yes.  

Do fiat currencies always devalue to zero?  Yes.

What about today's fiat currencies?  They are well on their ways to zero.  

Did criminal bankers get bailouts about ten years ago?  Yes.  

Did criminal bankers go to jail for causing the 2008/9 crisis?  No, they got paid huge bonuses from the bailout money.  

Did anything significant get fixed as a result of 2008/9.  No.  In fact, today's situation is even worse than then.  

Are banker bailouts still happening?  Apparently: recent Fed repo activities... looks like some Too Big To Fail / Too Big To Jail entity is insolvent.  Stay tuned.

Are negative interest rates a strong warning signal.  Yes.  

Is Bitcoin better than fiat money?  For getting paid and buying groceries, not yet.   For long-term, buy-and-hold investing, yes.  

Is Bitcoin a better long-term investment than stocks?  Yes.  

Is Bitcoin better than bonds?  Yes.  

Is Bitcoin a better long-term investment than real estate?  Until the current bubbles pop, certainly.  For all time?  Yes, because real estate has significant holding costs, real estate can be confiscated, real estate is a sitting duck for high taxes.  

Is Bitcoin better than gold?  In many ways, yes.  Overall, for sure.  

Should people panic and sell their Bitcoin holdings because of a sudden change in price?  That's not for me to decide.  Still, I learned a long time ago not to panic.  

Has Bitcoin seen sudden and significant price changes in the past?  Yes, both up and down.

Suppose the FBI busts a network of pedophiles or terrorists, and finds a list of public addresses that they use to receive bitcoin, and suppose the government passes a law making it illegal to receive bitcoin from these addresses: anyone who receive bitcoin that is linked to these addresses (no matter how many addresses it moved in between) must send the same amount directly back to the address that it was received from. 
They won’t criminilize all bitcoin, only these transactions. They will force every app that is uploaded to Google Play or Apple AppStore to follow this new rule. I think that the general public in America will accept it (Obviously the Americans in this forum will not).

This bitcoin will still be tradable in countries that do not follow US regulations, like China and Iran, but sooner or later we will have two bitcoins: “white bitcoin” and “black bitcoin”, and they will have different prices.

Do you think this is an actual threat to bitcoin? Do you think this scenario will never happen because terrorists/pedophiles will automatically convert every bitcoin they receive to Monero or other altcoins as soon as they receive it?
Do you think such law could push the bitcoin community to add more privacy features, or fork bitcoin to something like “Bitcoinero”?

I personally don’t think we should try “solving” problems before they actually happened, but I wonder about the future.",1574528773.0

I believe there is a chance that the next recession could be a doozy, and say a substantial credit downgrade on US Treasury bonds, bond holders demanding higher interest rates, or the US somehow defaulting on its outstanding debt instead of say mass printing off a good $23,000,000,000,000 as opposed to  of absolving itself from debt...there could be a major change in the world order on USD being the world's reserve currency.

[This news comes from https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/](https://preview.redd.it/p9rwbjmjqd041.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2aa0adeaffa7d4a151034b93b2aebe64a3e1554)

Finland is preparing to defend itself against a mysterious activist group threatening to carry out cyberattacks — unless it gets some Bitcoin.

More than 200 Finnish public organizations and municipalities have taken part in the drills. The scenario reportedly involves a hypothetical hacking crew demanding payment before waging various cyberattacks, Yleisradio Oy (YLE) reports.

These measures are in direct response to threats made by an activist group calling itself #Tietovuoto321 (“data breach 321”), which sent Bitcoin ransom demands to 235 public organizations across Finland on October 10.

So far, government offices and towns have seen their websites and data systems come under simulated attack twice in the past month. A third practice day is reportedly scheduled for next week.

YLE noted that participating organizations have responded “enthusiastically.”

Ransomware attacks on public facilities and municipalities have increased in frequency over the past year, and not just in Finland.

Hard Fork has previously reported that several US hospitals hit by ransomware attacks opted to pay the hackers to recover their systems.

Earlier this month, hackers held computer systems belonging to Mexican state-owned oil firm Pemex to ransom for a gut-twisting $4.9 million worth of Bitcoin.

It’s not all bad news, though. One ransomware victim recently exacted revenge on his attackers by infiltrating infrastructure powering their malware, releasing thousands of decryption keys to help others recover their files for free.",1574519171.0

So my question is now that we're roughly 6 months from the halvening would it make sense to increase my DCA by 25%, 50%, or even 100%?  I get that this might defeat the purpose of DCA in general but it seems safe to assume, albeit based on past performance, that bitcoin will begin its upswing over the course of this period and we might never see another opportunity to by at prices this low again.

The same way people might drop $5 on the ground, people could lose track of their keys.  Sure, it's irresponsible, but humans are prone to mistakes.  Given that, bitcoins buying power would continue to rise thus causing the value of commodities to constantly change.  And does that mean that we'd essentially be buying and selling an indefinitely small amount of Satoshies?  Sorry if this seems confusing.  Just interested in how this might all work out.

4) Instant

5) Widely adopted by people/vendors online (however you want to define this). Maybe not to the level of Visa/Paypal, but at least a giant leap from where we are now.

1. The mining efficiency of the network is increasing greatly as Bitmain rolls out their newest miners like the  Antminer S17 Pro; no doubt they've been using their own equipment on the network before public sales as has been the historical case for big efficiency leap rigs.
2. Couple this with the somewhat usual end-of-year settling up that occurs between Nov - Jan that we've seen in the past.

Food for thought: as the higher efficiency rigs propagate the energy cost for mining Bitcoin nearly halves to $3,380 at 12.5 BTC. However, once the block reward cuts in half next year then the energy cost will double.

Is this market movement the result of mining groups offloading a lot of their cheaply mined coins at the higher value now before the price moves downwards towards the energy production cost?

Still all Wild Mass Guessing.

Unfortunately however bitcoin has the most powerful enemies in the world and the big banks and Wall St would never allow for this environment to exist  as doing would instantly propel bitcoin, the first truly finite asset in history, into the stratosphere.  So with all that being said, here are the tools that I believe they are using to manipulate and control Bitcoin's fiat value via the following:


- the big banks are heavily invested in all of major exchanges (fiat on/off ramps). 


These exchanges employ several tactics to maintain the price of bitcoin by having the following:


a) OTC (Over The Counter) markets to big money 

b) spot markets for the masses 

c) APIs (Application Program Interface) on the spot markets that trade bitcoin back and forth with each other all day at whatever price deemed appropriate. 

d) Access.  Whenever the demand side of the supply /demand profile becomes too much for them to handle they simply pull the plug and say technical difficultues. They then spook the traders /investors into backing off, letting demand cool off temporarily, then turn access back on. 

- Cash settled futures 

Cash settled futures have been used by big banks and Wall Street for decades to control the price of hard assets like gold. Please research how they have done this to the gold markets. 


Other areas which I see as possible threats are infiltration into many of the large bitcoin wallets. Because of this I prefer to roll my own bitcoin addresses with dice and creating paper wallets. Thus removing the trust in the wallet software development folks that they are truly random generation. Furthermore I generate only P2PKH addresses so that I can independently sign bitcoin messages with these addresses to know for certainty that I and alone control them.

Ok, here's the good news. In my opinion I believe that as more and more people realize these things and familiarize themselves with terms like rehypothification and commingling, that the supply and demand profile will ultimately break bitcoin free from the suppression by Wall St. All we need to do is simply move our crypto to addresses that independently control and the math will do the rest. 

We must all remember that Bitcoin was created to be an alternative financial system that empowers the sovereignty of the individual. Let's empower this global peaceful revolution and make custody solutions a term only used with respect to the individual HODLers. Bitcoin should never be stored anywhere other than your own addresses that you and you alone control the private keys.",1574458877.0

Now you have zero coin
7,000 cash in hand -fees

### Major Branches of Cryptology (as we see it)

(these sections will introduce the terms in context, though complete definitions will not be given)

**Encryption**

privacy of messages  
using ciphers and codes to protect the secrecy of messages  
DES is the most common symmetric cipher (same key for encryption and decryption)  
RSA is the most common asymmetric cipher (different keys for encryption and decryption)

**Signatures and Authentication**

proving who you are  
proving you signed a document (and not someone else)

**Untraceable Mail**

untraceable sending and receiving of mail and messages  
focus: defeating eavesdroppers and traffic analysis  
DC protocol (dining cryptographers)

**Cryptographic Voting**

focus: ballot box anonymity  
credentials for voting  
issues of double voting, security, robustness, efficiency

**Digital Cash**

focus: privacy in transactions, purchases  
unlinkable credentials  
blinded notes  
""digital coins"" may not be possible

**Crypto Anarchy**

using the above to evade government, to bypass tax collection, etc.  
a technological solution to the problem of too much government

## Glossary

**agoric systems**

open, free market systems in which voluntary transactions are central.

**Alice and Bob**

cryptographic protocols are often made clearer by considering parties A and B, or Alice and Bob, performing some protocol. Eve the eavesdropper, Paul the prover, and Vic the verifier are other common stand-in names.

**ANDOS**

all or nothing disclosure of secrets.

**anonymous credential**

a credential which asserts some right or privilege or fact without revealing the identity of the holder. This is unlike CA driver's licenses.

**asymmetric cipher**

same as public key cryptosystem.

**authentication**

the process of verifying an identity or credential, to ensure you are who you said you were.

**biometric security**

a type of authentication using fingerprints, retinal scans, palm prints, or other physical/biological signatures of an individual.

**bit commitment**

e.g., tossing a coin and then committing to the value without being able to change the outcome. The blob is a cryptographic primitive for this.

**blinding, blinded signatures**

A signature that the signer does not remember having made. A blind signature is always a cooperative protocol and the receiver of the signature provides the signer with the blinding information.

**blob**

the crypto equivalent of a locked box. A cryptographic primitive for bit commitment, with the properties that a blobs can represent a 0 or a 1, that others cannot tell be looking whether itUs a 0 or a 1, that the creator of the blob can ""open"" the blob to reveal the contents, and that no blob can be both a 1 and a 0. An example of this is a flipped coin covered by a hand.

**channel**

the path over which messages are transmitted. Channels may be secure or insecure, and may have eavesdroppers (or enemies, or disrupters, etc.) who alter messages, insert and delete messages, etc. Cryptography is the means by which communications over insecure channels are protected.

**chosen plaintext attack**

an attack where the cryptanalyst gets to choose the plaintext to be enciphered, e.g., when possession of an enciphering machine or algorithm is in the possession of the cryptanalyst.

**cipher**

a secret form of writing, using substitution or transposition of characters or symbols.

**ciphertext**

the plaintext after it has been encrypted.

**code**

a restricted cryptosystem where words or letters of a message are replaced by other words chosen from a codebook. Not part of modern cryptology, but still useful.

**coin flipping**

an important crypto primitive, or protocol, in which the equivalent of flipping a fair coin is possible. Implemented with blobs.

**collusion**

wherein several participants cooperate to deduce the identity of a sender or receiver, or to break a cipher. Most cryptosystems are sensitive to some forms of collusion. Much of the work on implementing DC Nets, for example, involves ensuring that colluders cannot isolate message senders and thereby trace origins and destinations of mail.

**computationally secure**

where a cipher cannot be broken with available computer resources, but in theory can be broken with enough computer resources. Contrast with unconditionally secure.

**countermeasure**

something you do to thwart an attacker.

**credential**

facts or assertions about some entity. For example, credit ratings, passports, reputations, tax status, insurance records, etc. Under the current system, these credentials are increasingly being cross-linked. Blind signatures may be used to create anonymous credentials.

**credential clearinghouse**

banks, credit agencies, insurance companies, police departments, etc., that correlate records and decide the status of records.

**cryptanalysis**

methods for attacking and breaking ciphers and related cryptographic systems. Ciphers may be broken, traffic may be analyzed, and passwords may be cracked. Computers are of course essential.

**crypto anarchy**

the economic and political system after the deployment of encryption, untraceable e-mail, digital pseudonyms, cryptographic voting, and digital cash. A pun on ""crypto,"" meaning ""hipen,"" and as when Gore Vidal called William F. Buckley a ""crypto fascist.""

**cryptography**

another name for cryptology.

**cryptology**

the science and study of writing, sending, receiving, and deciphering secret messages. Includes authentication, digital signatures, the hiding of messages (steganography), cryptanalysis, and several other fields.

**cyberspace**

the electronic domain, the Nets, and computer-generated spaces. Some say it is the ""consensual reality"" described in ""Neuromancer."" Others say it is the phone system. Others have work to do.

**DC protocol, or DC-Net**

the dining cryptographers protocol. DC-Nets use multiple participants communicating with the DC protocol.

**DES**

the Data Encryption Standard, proposed in 1977 by the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), with assistance from the National Security Agency. Based on the ""Lucifer"" cipher developed by Horst Feistel at IBM, DES is a secret key cryptosystem that cycles 64-bit blocks of data through multiple permutations with a 56-bit key controlling the routing. ""Diffusion"" and ""confusion"" are combined to form a cipher that has not yet been cryptanalyzed (see ""DES, Security of""). DES is in use for interbank transfers, as a cipher inside of several RSA-based systems, and is available for PCs.

**DES, Security of**

many have speculated that the NSA placed a trapdoor (or back door) in DES to allow it to read DES-encrypted messages. This has not been proved. It is known that the original Lucifer algorithm used a 128-bit key and that this key length was shortened to 64 bits (56 bits plus 8 parity bits), thus making exhaustive search much easier (so far as is known, brute-force search has not been done, though it should be feasible today). Shamir and Bihan have used a technique called ""differential cryptanalysis"" to reduce the exhaustive search needed for chosen plaintext attacks (but with no import for ordinary DES).

**differential cryptanalysis the Shamir-Biham**

technique for cryptanalyzing DES. With a chosen plaintext attack, they've reduced the number of DES keys that must be tried from about 2\^56 to about 2\^47 or less. Note, however, that rarely can an attacker mount a chosen plaintext attack on DES systems.

**digital cash, digital money**

Protocols for transferring value, monetary or otherwise, electronically. Digital cash usually refers to systems that are anonymous. Digital money systems can be used to implement any quantity that is conserved, such as points, mass, dollars, etc. There are many variations of digital money systems, ranging from VISA numbers to blinded signed digital coins. A topic too large for a single glossary entry.

**digital pseudonym**

basically, a ""crypto identity."" A way for individuals to set up accounts with various organizations without revealing more information than they wish. Users may have several digital pseudonyms, some used only once, some used over the course of many years. Ideally, the pseudonyms can be linked only at the will of the holder. In the simplest form, a public key can serve as a digital pseudonym and need not be linked to a physical identity.

**digital signature**

Analogous to a written signature on a document. A modification to a message that only the signer can make but that everyone can recognize. Can be used legally to contract at a distance.

**digital timestamping**

one function of a digital notary public, in which some message (a song, screenplay, lab notebook, contract, etc.) is stamped with a time that cannot (easily) be forged.

**dining cryptographers protocol (aka DC protocol, DC nets)**

the untraceable message sending system invented by David Chaum. Named after the ""dining philosophers"" problem in computer science, participants form circuits and pass messages in such a way that the origin cannot be deduced, barring collusion. At the simplest level, two participants share a key between them. One of them sends some actual message by bitwise exclusive-ORing the message with the key, while the other one just sends the key itself. The actual message from this pair of participants is obtained by XORing the two outputs. However, since nobody but the pair knows the original key, the actual message cannot be traced to either one of the participants.

**discrete logarithm problem**

given integers a, n, and x, find some integer m such that a\^m mod n = x, if m exists. Modular exponentiation, the a\^m mod n part, is straightforward (and special purpose chips are available), but the inverse problem is believed to be very hard, in general. Thus it is conjectured that modular exponentiation is a one-way function.

**DSS, Digital Signature Standard**

the latest NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, successor to NBS) standard for digital signatures. Based on the El Gamal cipher, some consider it weak and poor substitute for RSA-based signature schemes.

**eavesdropping, or passive wiretapping**

intercepting messages without detection. Radio waves may be intercepted, phone lines may be tapped, and computers may have RF emissions detected. Even fiber optic lines can be tapped.

**factoring**

Some large numbers are difficult to factor. It is conjectured that there are no feasible--i.e.""easy,"" less than exponential in size of number-- factoring methods. It is also an open problem whether RSA may be broken more easily than by factoring the modulus (e.g., the public key might reveal information which simplifies the problem). Interestingly, though factoring is believed to be ""hard"", it is not known to be in the class of NP-hard problems. Professor Janek invented a factoring device, but he is believed to be fictional.

**information-theoretic security ""unbreakable""**

security, in which no amount of cryptanalysis can break a cipher or system. One time pads are an example (providing the pads are not lost nor stolen nor used more than once, of course). Same as unconditionally secure.

**key**

a piece of information needed to encipher or decipher a message. Keys may be stolen, bought, lost, etc., just as with physical keys.

**key exchange, or key distribution**

the process of sharing a key with some other party, in the case of symmetric ciphers, or of distributing a public key in an asymmetric cipher. A major issue is that the keys be exchanged reliably and without compromise. Diffie and Hellman devised one such scheme, based on the discrete logarithm problem.

**known-plaintext attack**

a cryptanalysis of a cipher where plaintext-ciphertext pairs are known. This attack searches for an unknown key. Contrast with the chosen plaintext attack, where the cryptanalyst can also choose the plaintext to be enciphered.

**mail, untraceable**

a system for sending and receiving mail without traceability or observability. Receiving mail anonymously can be done with broadcast of the mail in encrypted form. Only the intended recipient (whose identity, or true name, may be unknown to the sender) may able to decipher the message. Sending mail anonymously apparently requires mixes or use of the dining cryptographers (DC) protocol.

**minimum disclosure proofs**

another name for zero knowledge proofs, favored by Chaum.

**mixes**

David Chaum's term for a box which performs the function of mixing, or decorrelating, incoming and outgoing electronic mail messages. The box also strips off the outer envelope (i.e., decrypts with its private key) and remails the message to the apress on the inner envelope. Tamper-resistant modules may be used to prevent cheating and forced disclosure of the mapping between incoming and outgoing mail. A sequence of many remailings effectively makes tracing sending and receiving impossible. Contrast this with the software version, the DC protocol.

**modular exponentiation**

raising an integer to the power of another integer, modulo some integer. For integers a, n, and m, a\^m mod n. For example, 5\^3 mod 100 = 25. Modular exponentiation can be done fairly quickly with a sequence of bit shifts and aps, and special purpose chips have been designed. See also discrete logarithm.

**National Security Agency (NSA)**

the largest intelligence agency, responsible for making and breaking ciphers, for intercepting communications, and for ensuring the security of U.S. computers. Headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland, with many listening posts around the world. The NSA funds cryptographic research and advises other agencies about cryptographic matters. The NSA once obviously had the world's leading cryptologists, but this may no longer be the case.

**negative credential**

a credential that you possess that you don't want any one else to know, for example, a bankruptcy filing. A formal version of a negative reputation.

**NP-complete**

a large class of difficult problems. ""NP"" stands for nondeterministic polynomial time, a class of problems thought in general not to have feasible algorithms for their solution. A problem is ""complete"" if any other NP problem may be reduced to that problem. Many important combinatorial and algebraic problems are NP-complete: the traveling salesman problem, the Hamiltonian cycle problem, the word problem, and on and on.

**oblivious transfer**

a cryptographic primitive that involves the probabilistic transmission of bits. The sender does not know if the bits were received.

**one-time pad**

a string of randomly-selected bits or symbols which is combined with a plaintext message to produce the ciphertext. This combination may be shifting letters some amount, bitwise exclusive-ORed, etc.). The recipient, who also has a copy of the one time pad, can easily recover the plaintext. Provided the pad is only used once and then destroyed, and is not available to an eavesdropper, the system is perfectly secure, i.e., it is information-theoretically secure. Key distribution (the pad) is obviously a practical concern, but consider CD-ROM's.

**one-way function**

a function which is easy to compute in one direction but hard to find any inverse for, e.g. modular exponentiation, where the inverse problem is known as the discrete logarithm problem. Compare the special case of trap door one-way functions. An example of a one-way operation is multiplication: it is easy to multiply two prime numbers of 100 digits to produce a 200-digit number, but hard to factor that 200-digit number.

**P ?=? NP**

Certainly the most important unsolved problem in complexity theory. If P = NP, then cryptography as we know it today does not exist. If P = NP, all NP problems are ""easy.""

**paping**

sending extra messages to confuse eavesdroppers and to defeat traffic analysis. Also aping random bits to a message to be enciphered.

**plaintext**

also called cleartext, the text that is to be enciphered.

**Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)**

Phillip Zimmerman's implementation of RSA, recently upgraded to version 2.0, with more robust components and several new features. RSA Data Security has threatened PZ so he no longer works on it. Version 2.0 was written by a consortium of non-U.S. hackers.

**prime numbers**

integers with no factors other than themselves and 1. The number of primes is unbounded. About 1% of the 100 decimal digit numbers are prime. Since there are about 10\^70 particles in the universe, there are about 10\^23 100 digit primes for each and every particle in the universe!

**probabilistic encryption**

a scheme by Goldwasser, Micali, and Blum that allows multiple ciphertexts for the same plaintext, i.e., any given plaintext may have many ciphertexts if the ciphering is repeated. This protects against certain types of known ciphertext attacks on RSA.

**proofs of identity**

proving who you are, either your true name, or your digital identity. Generally, possession of the right key is sufficient proof (guard your key!). Some work has been done on ""is-a-person"" credentialling agencies, using the so-called Fiat-Shamir protocol...think of this as a way to issue unforgeable digital passports. Physical proof of identity may be done with biometric security methods. Zero knowledge proofs of identity reveal nothing beyond the fact that the identity is as claimed. This has obvious uses for computer access, passwords, etc.

**protocol**

a formal procedure for solving some problem. Modern cryptology is mostly about the study of protocols for many problems, such as coin-flipping, bit commitment (blobs), zero knowledge proofs, dining cryptographers, and so on.

**public key**

the key distributed publicly to potential message-senders. It may be published in a phonebook-like directory or otherwise sent. A major concern is the validity of this public key to guard against spoofing or impersonation.

**public key cryptosystem**

the modern breakthrough in cryptology, designed by Diffie and Hellman, with contributions from several others. Uses trap door one-way functions so that encryption may be done by anyone with access to the ""public key"" but decryption may be done only by the holder of the ""private key."" Encompasses public key encryption, digital signatures, digital cash, and many other protocols and applications.

**public key encryption**

the use of modern cryptologic methods to provided message security and authentication. The RSA algorithm is the most widely used form of public key encryption, although other systems exist. A public key may be freely published, e.g., in phonebook-like directories, while the corresponding private key is closely guarded.

**public key patents**

M.I.T. and Stanford, due to the work of Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle, formed Public Key Partners to license the various public key, digital signature, and RSA patents. These patents, granted in the early 1980s, expire in the between 1998 and 2002. PKP has licensed RSA Data Security Inc., of Redwood City, CA, which handles the sales, etc.

**quantum cryptography**

a system based on quantum-mechanical principles. Eavesdroppers alter the quantum state of the system and so are detected. Developed by Brassard and Bennett, only small laboratory demonstrations have been made.

**reputations**

the trail of positive and negative associations and judgments that some entity accrues. Credit ratings, academic credentials, and trustworthiness are all examples. A digital pseudonym will accrue these reputation credentials based on actions, opinions of others, etc. In crypto anarchy, reputations and agoric systems will be of paramount importance. There are many fascinating issues of how reputation-based systems work, how credentials can be bought and sold, and so forth.

**RSA**

the main public key encryption algorithm, developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Kenneth Adleman. It exploits the difficulty of factoring large numbers to create a private key and public key. First invented in 1978, it remains the core of modern public key systems. It is usually much slower than DES, but special-purpose modular exponentiation chips will likely speed it up. A popular scheme for speed is to use RSA to transmit session keys and then a high-speed cipher like DES for the actual message text.

**Description**

Let p and q be large primes, typically with more than 100 digits. Let n = pq and find some e such that e is relatively prime to (p - 1)(q - 1). The set of numbers p, q, and e is the private key for RSA. The set of numbers n and e forms the public key (recall that knowing n is not sufficient to easily find p and q...the factoring problem). A message M is encrypted by computing M\^e mod n. The owner of the private key can decrypt the encrypted message by exploiting number theory results, as follows. An integer d is computed such that ed =1 (mod (p - 1)(q - 1)). Euler proved a theorem that M\^(ed) = M mod n and so M\^(ed) mod n = M. This means that in some sense the integers e and d are ""inverses"" of each other. \[If this is unclear, please see one of the many texts and articles on public key encryption.\]

**secret key cryptosystem**

A system which uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt traffic at each end of a communication link. Also called a symmetric or one-key system. Contrast with public key cryptosystem.

**smart cards**

a computer chip embeped in credit card. They can hold cash, credentials, cryptographic keys, etc. Usually these are built with some degree of tamper-resistance. Smart cards may perform part of a crypto transaction, or all of it. Performing part of it may mean checking the computations of a more powerful computer, e.g., one in an ATM.

**spoofing, or masquerading**

posing as another user. Used for stealing passwords, modifying files, and stealing cash. Digital signatures and other authentication methods are useful to prevent this. Public keys must be validated and protected to ensure that others don't substitute their own public keys which users may then unwittingly use.

**steganography**

a part of cryptology dealing with hiding messages and obscuring who is sending and receiving messages. Message traffic is often paped to reduce the signals that would otherwise come from a supen beginning of messages.

**symmetric cipher**

same as private key cryptosystem.

**tamper-responding modules, tamper-resistant modules (TRMs)**

sealed boxes or modules which are hard to open, requiring extensive probing and usually leaving ample evidence that the tampering has occurred. Various protective techniques are used, such as special metal or oxide layers on chips, armored coatings, embeped optical fibers, and other measures to thwart analysis. Popularly called ""tamper-proof boxes."" Uses include: smart cards, nuclear weapon initiators, cryptographic key holders, ATMs, etc.

**tampering, or active wiretapping**

interfering with messages and possibly modifying them. This may compromise data security, help to break ciphers, etc. See also spoofing.

**token**

some representation, such as ID cards, subway tokens, money, etc., that indicates possession of some property or value.

**traffic analysis**

determining who is sending or receiving messages by analyzing packets, frequency of packets, etc. A part of steganography. Usually handled with traffic paping.

**transmission rules**

the protocols for determining who can send messages in a DC protocol, and when. These rules are needed to prevent collision and deliberate jamming of the channels.

**trap messages**

dummy messages in DC Nets which are used to catch jammers and disrupters. The messages contain no private information and are published in a blob beforehand so that the trap message can later be opened to reveal the disrupter. (There are many strategies to explore here.)

**trap-door**

In cryptography, a piece of secret information that allows the holder of a private key to invert a normally hard to invert function.

**trap-door one way functions**

functions which are easy to compute in both the forward and reverse direction but for which the disclosure of an algorithm to compute the function in the forward direction does not provide information on how to compute the function in the reverse direction. More simply put, trap-door one way functions are one way for all but the holder of the secret information. The RSA algorithm is the best-known example of such a function.

**unconditional security**

same as information-theoretic security, that is, unbreakable except by loss or theft of the key.

**unconditionally secure**

where no amount of intercepted ciphertext is enough to allow the cipher to be broken, as with the use of a one-time pad cipher. Contrast with computationally secure.

**voting, cryptographic**

Various schemes have been devised for anonymous, untraceable voting. Voting schemes should have several properties: privacy of the vote, security of the vote (no multiple votes), robustness against disruption by jammers or disrupters, verifiability (voter has confidence in the results), and efficiency.

**zero knowledge proofs**

proofs in which no knowledge of the actual proof is conveyed. Peggy the Prover demonstrates to Sid the Skeptic that she is indeed in possession of some piece of knowledge without actually revealing any of that knowledge. This is useful for access to computers, because eavesdroppers or dishonest sysops cannot steal the knowledge given. Also called minimum disclosure proofs. Useful for proving possession of some property, or credential, such as age or voting status, without revealing personal information.",1574453879.0

The climb from the bottom is always volatile and uncertain... for good psychological and fundamental reasons.

Psychologically post crash many investors are easily spooked, quick to sell with negative news, quick to lock in profits.  Fundamentally large volumes bought at bubble prices will use any price rise to liquidate.

VWAP and similar measures help gauge at what price those sellers might be willing to unload.  A quick look at volumes since 2017 will show very obvious resistance at around $8000 and $14000 and pretty solid support near $3000.

That $14k resistance will not be broken easily. As soon as the price nears it, the bears will wake up.  All those who chased the bubble with little conviction will see this as their chance to exit.

new difficulty is calculated every 2016th block.Imagine if the network just mined the 2015th block and have started mining the next one (the block with the new target difficulty). When this new block is mined we will be able to see what the new difficulty target is in the block header.

My question- Does the bitcoin network broadcast the new difficulty before the 2016th block is produced? or is it hidden until the new block with the new difficulty is mined?

[This news comes from https:\/\/cointelegraph.com](https://preview.redd.it/9xoju7fmg5041.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=580f096831adff6e8737d6e38d7c5999dc3c2648)

South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb is denying recent reports that Chinese authorities have raided its Shanghai offices.

On Nov. 21, a Bithumb spokesperson informed the Block that the recent rumors of a police raid and closure of the exchange’s Shanghai offices are false and that its one and only Shanghai team continues to operate “steadily without pause.”

Yesterday, Chinese media reportedly wrote that the South Korean crypto exchange had told its employees to take a long vacation, without informing them about any specific date on when to return to work. Bithumb has now denied these news reports.

**Binance is also denying media reports**

Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance also came forward refuting media reports that claimed that Chinese police had raided and subsequently shut down the exchange’s Shanghai offices, which according to the exchange, “don’t even exist:”“The Binance team is a global movement consisting of people working in a decentralized manner wherever they are in the world. Binance has no fixed offices in Shanghai or China, so it makes no sense that police raided on any offices and shut them down.”

A Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the exchange is apparently being targeted in the Chinese media, pointing to the “recent spike in the number of negative articles and activities against Binance” in the country. Binance further said：“We also encourage our friends from the media to verify if their ‘sources’ are telling the truth or presenting their own agenda.”

**Crypto markets take a dive amid reports**

The rumors of police raids and closure of Binance and Bithumb offices were accompanied by a sharp drop in cryptocurrency prices, which at press time, were continuing to find lower lows. The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), for example, took a significant hit of around 5% on the day, trading at around $7,640 per coin.",1574418976.0

Not sure what to do.",0,dzp93s,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dzp93s/bought_bitcoin_at_a_bitcoin_atm_machine_yesterday/,3,"Looks like in order to actually be able to use the btc I bought, it needs to get to 6+ confirmations in the wallet before I can spend it.  The first few confirmations went fine, but then once it got to 3 confirmations it's just staying stuck at 3 confirmations for some reason.  It's been almost 24 hours now.  

If this is fairly normal during high traffic times (maybe because bitcoin price just plummeted right during the middle of this), and I just have to wait a day or two, then that's fine, it's not super urgent, albeit a bit annoying.

But, if this amount of time of it being stuck at 3 confirmations is an indicator that it will be permanently stuck and I will just literally never have it get to 6+ confirmations, and essentially lose the cash I spent on trying to buy it from the ATM, then, obviously that would not be okay, and I'd have to try to do something about it (if there's anything that I can do, that is).

Making $5,000-$20,000 While Heating my House for the winter - Can it be done?",9,dzq7u6,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dzq7u6/hodl_heating_making_500020000_while_heating_my/,29,"We can start with a disclaimer by saying that: *this might be a crazy or weird concept, but I believe it is possible; and I will be doing it to ensure that it is possible for anyone*.

Thought: “I am going to heat my house and make $5000 this winter”

Possibility: Who knows?

I contacted a local mining operation who has always been great to me (**Info about them below**) and store last month and they let me know that they have been selling off some of the miners as they had one of their warehouses shut down by the town (they said they were selling them at a price point where payoff was taken into consideration) and that they had over **5000 computers to sell**. So I purchased 8 Miners to see what happened, I had them shipped as they were coming from a Georgia mining operation they had. The miners showed up today and Im getting the power ready at my own house, the mining company joked with me about the idea of heating my house for the winter, cold upstate New York. The miners, as this community knows, put off an incredible amount of heat when hashing. I plan to setup the miners in place of my central air system in my house and heat my entire house with them. I believe that I can make money while heating my house, which would normally cost me around $500 a month for around 5 months, so $2500 in savings. And my calculator says that I should make around $470 a month, and i plan to buy more miners anyways from BCM, as they were very cheap and great condition for used miners. The savings and profit should make me around **$5000 in the winter alone**. I will keep everyone updated and post a list of all my transactions and endeavors within the crypto and bitcoin market/space for anyone interested below.

&#x200B;

Last year, I came across BCM (BigCatMining) as they have a location in my area upstate New York. I had been into bitcoin and crypto for a little while and I toyed with the idea of mining and realized that I missed the boat, so cloud mining sounded like the option for me. I contacted BCM at their website [Link](http://www.bigcatmining.com/) about a year ago asking about a cloud contract, and they were very helpful with setting me up, (huge shoutout). I think I spent around $500 on a contract and by the time the contract was up I had generated around $720 or so. With the confidence boost from that return I decided to buy a $5000 Contract expecting to get $2000 in profit and after a few months of waiting generated **$12000** which was **$7000 in Profit.** I proceeded to invest with them a few times where I either gained or lost money but it was an overall positive and they kept me updated throughout the entire process. I believe I profited around $15,000 overall through my cloud mining experience. But again a huge shoutout to[ bigcatmining.com](http://www.bigcatmining.com/) for giving me all the opportunities they have, and just overall friendly and fair services (Rare to come by, especially in this market).

In my case, it did get 3 confirmations reasonably quickly, but then it just never got any more confirmations, it's just been stuck at 3 for like a day, and it needs to get to 6+ before I can actually use it in my wallet to spend it myself.

I am fairly new to this stuff, so I was pretty freaked out when I read some stuff about how if a long enough timespan goes by (several days?) then if it is still stuck at less than (6? not sure how many) confirmations by that point, it'll just be a failed transaction and get returned to the sender.

If that happens, I just lose all my money that I spent trying to buy the bitcoin from the bitcoin ATM machine, right?  Because in this case it's not some human friend of mine I can go try again with, it's just some machine, so the machine/company gets its bitcoin back, and but I can't just go walk up to the machine and have it spit my cash back to me I assume.

So, now I'm trying to figure out how many more hours or days I have left before that is going to happen.

If it's been almost a day at this point, does that mean I have only a few hours left before I'm screwed?  A few days?  Weeks?

**EDIT** Checked it on an explorer and looks like it must have been a bug with my wallet.  It had a ton of confirmations on the explorer, so it was just the wallet giving me an incorrect status of 3 confirmations.  Seems to be working now.  Well, that was annoying.

Unfortunately, Drive Wealth no longer offer the bitcoin deposit option and since I've been looking for some other good reputation stablished broker that accepts BTC.
Does any of you, ladies and gentlemen know of such a broker?

&#x200B;

The business development and technological development and mainstreaming, adoption and integration fundamentals have never literally never been as good as they are now. We've even come lightyears in progress on the financial rights and legal development framework for the crypto economy.

And yet the 100,000 ton Brontosaurus in the room are several things that are most likely keeping the price down and most likely responsible for manipulation and keeping it suppressed.

\-The US Gov is fundamentally a bad actor in the space. It doesn't cooperate with the rest of the world, exerts itself, and overbears in regulation, primarily to support the CME

\-The CME is going to commit accounting fraud and naked short sell bitcoin as it has since 2017 to suppress the price. The CME is perpetually bearish and this is what the US gov wants. This is what wallstreet legacy finance want. They are hoarding, centralizing, and rehypothecatiing the price, and centralizing the mining, and contributing to the centralization of the mining.

\-Wallstreet institutions are intentionally bankrupting miners to take over the mining space.

\-The Financial sector/class/US regulators want to punish and put out of business existing exchanges (except coinbase) and existing miners and give the space over to an appointed monopoly run by institutions like Fidelity. 

\-They plan to do great harm to the space with The Bank Secrecy Act and FinCen

&#x200B;

In short Wallstreet is hijacking the network and turning it into digital full KYC banking, with even less rights than a bank and less fungibility and integrity than holding gold at a money manager.
