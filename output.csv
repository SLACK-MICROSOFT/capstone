Enjoy."
296,"but ok, realistically, you want to do a few things...  


1) anticipate it.  Think about your orgasm (and however you're *actually* getting there, whether it's with a toy, your own hand, a partner's mouth,face,pussy, whatever).  Think about it all day at work.  Look forward to it.  Have it on your mind.  


2) stretch beforehand.  I don't only mean stretch your dick.  I mean stretch like you would before a run or other workout.  loosen your muscles, extend your legs, touch your toes, raise your arms, all of the warmup stuff.

  
3) Part of what makes it enjoyable is that few moments afterward while you catch your breath and your partner (or hand) does too.  Since you just engaged most of your body's nerve responses, you have a few minutes before any chronic pain sets in again, and muscular aches or whatever start up again, etc.  Be sure before starting that you will not have to immediately jump up to do something else.  Your door is closed, so a pet can't come jump up near the mess or in any other way disturb you, and spend about 5 minutes just kind of feeling the post-nut clarity before your senses come back.  If you have a ceiling fan where you are, it should be on.  cold moving air on your junk enhances this.   If you must get up within those 5 minutes or so, you owe it to yourself to have a cigarette even if you don't normally smoke.

  
4) When you are about to orgasm, lift your legs off whatever surface they are on.  Trust me on this one."
297,Agreed.

299,"I (34m) remember waking up crying at 4 years old because I had a bad dream. My mom (single mother) was not in her room or in the house. I figured she'd be at the neighbor's house since she was good friends with him. 

Walked into the house (country road, no one locked their doors) and heard noise in the bedroom. I walked in, soaked in tears, and saw my mom on top of the guy in the dark. She saw me, got up naked, put a robe on and took me home and put me back to bed.

300,I took a trip to Canada and kayaked a bunch of lakes for like 60 miles. So beautiful
301,"Dancing for the first time with my then-boyfriend. I was really nervous and don't like to draw attention to myself, but he said he'd never had so much fun."
302,"It‚Äôs pretty depressing, but it was saying goodbye to my best friend before they moved away."
303,"I would say it matters *why.*  If it's something as simple as ""we don't like non-white people,"" then yeah, racist.  If it's something more like, ""we lack the experience and connections to meaningfully answer questions (or find those who can answer questions) this child may have about their identity in terms of their ancestry and culture of their ancestry,"" then that's more reasonable."
304,It's not racist at all. Anyone who thinks this is an idiot.
305,I'm just here for the show
306,I never heard anyone say this before
307,i‚Äôm not sure what this is about - but why would you want white children over other races? if i were to have a child i wouldn‚Äôt give two shits about their skin
308,Interesting strawman you got going there.
309,What?
310,"I don't believe it's racist but I understand why. Even though it's 2020, there is still a hierarchy with races, white being at the top. My cousin told me the reason she wants to have white children and that's because she doesn't want her children to be refused for a job, group, etc. Because of their race. It'll just make it harder for them to grow up."
311,I guess I'm a progressive but that's not what I believe.
312,"What a strange question. 

I think it is natural to want your children to resemble you.

If you are white and your spouse is black/ asian then it might be a little selfish/ ignorant or even racist if you wanted your kid to look 100% white. 

Just depends what is driving the desire."
313,Odds are pretty high that two white people are going to have a white child.
314,why do you want white children?
315,"Yep same, we need popcorn"
316,"Because I prefer European beauty and physical features over non-European appearances, and I feel it is my duty as a white person to preserve European appearances for the future, especially inside Europe."
317,"I'm European and I'm not white. Your perception of ""European beauty"" is flawed because what you mean to say is ""white beauty"""
318,Are you even beautiful yourself tho? Post a pic.
319,why is that your duty? I don‚Äôt necessarily think theres anything wrong with having a preference but i guess i just don‚Äôt understand why you feel the need to preserve that. do you think there is something wrong with white people who dont feel the same?
320,Got the 14 words tucked away in here huh?
321,Got the 14 words tucked away in here huh?
322,"White means European. Whites are the original people of Europe who have indigenous European physical features. Everyone knows what is meant by ""European appearance"". The fact that there are now numerous Africans, Arabs, Asians, Indians etc. in Europe does not change what European appearance means. The fact that there are white Europeans in South Africa does not change the fact that ""sub-Saharan African appearance"" implies dark skin, broad flat noses, big lips, nappy Afro hair, black eyes, prognathist facial bone structure, etc.

What is the point of your comment anyway?"

336,"Android has a new font today, it's not much different but enough to notice."
337,I‚Äôm afraid not only Android.
338,"Living in 2020, the big future year that everyone was talking about. Why the fuck am I still paying more than 30k for school? Why is it more expensive to have good healthcare than to make payments on a sports car? Why does minimum wage still not even cover basic rent? Why aren't we doing anything about the ice caps melting and weather getting fucking crazy?

The asshole doesn't give a fuck about anyone but the 1% of rich folks. We need someone who does."
339,"I don't spend much energy, but I'm on a lunch break so I'll dive in on this.

SCOTUS appointees. He is making a very conservative SCOTUS. This could effect us for decades. The biggest example currently is the possibility of overturning Roe. And Trump is simultaneously working to defund planned parenthood. This will affect anyone who likes sex, as women lock down more because they can't access legal and safe abortions as a last resort anymore. When I was younger and hitting my GF raw, I thanked anyone who would listen that at the very end of the list of options, we had that goal-line defense. We still used BC, and never had to use it, but imagine how fucked up our lives would be if we had a kid in HS or College? Fuck that. Also, it's kind of fucked up that a bunch of old men are ruling on what women can do with their own bodies. I know if a bunch of old women told me what I could do with my male body, I'd tell them to fuck right off lol. Women have to give up their bodies, their life even, to gestate a baby, they should have the choice to terminate. It really is that simple IMO.

He has eroded alliances on the world stage, and hurt the US's reputation. This one sucks, but honestly, Trump isn't strong enough to kill these relationships. The next president will get an ""easy win"" just by coming into power and being generally more pleasant on his tour abroad. He'll just ""restore"" the faith in the US by being more put together and not talking shit on twitter, and hopefully we'll get back to normal. But if that doesn't happen, the erosion of alliances, especially one like NATO, could cause the US to be in much more danger. NATO is by far the strongest alliance on Earth. It's nigh unbeatable. Russia and China would LOVE to see it splinter, so they can operate with more impunity. NATO protects the US as top dog in the world, because we are the driving force behind it.

Then you have the precedents he is setting with all of his shady actions. He got away with the transgressions that led to impeachment. This means that is now ""acceptable behavior"". The Republicans are going to be really butthurt when a Democratic president does what Trump did and more, because ""hey, it's no big deal! nothing happened!""... In general it's just a corrupt way to run the office of POTUS. I'd rather neither side engage in it, than both sides.

&#x200B;

But in general, he hasn't really ruined my life or anything. He's just a cunt. We'll be done with him soon, either next year or in 4.5 years... But the shit he gets away with today will be the new standard for the next guy, and that's what sucks."

281,I know it probably would end up badly but in that situation i beilive i would press the pedal and try to flee or in the very least hit thr bull back
282,"When you said hit the bull, it reminded me of that scene from Bull Durham where Tim Robbins' character intentionally throws the ball to the bull mascot."
283,Corona is going digital now? Fuck this shit I'll go live in the woods alone!

292,Her ass is hot enough that it doesn't get cold
293,What hat?
294,Some times it‚Äôs the only way to deal with that burning feeling when it gets real bad
295,"Meh, if she was bottomless, this would apply"
296,you are not confused at all. disturbed? maybe.
297,A condom clearly.
298,"I'm the sequel to dazed and confused, confused and disturbed. It's about how Mathew McConaughey starts kidnapping high school girls and torturing them because he believes he's trapped in time. He gets older but the girls stay the same age, alright, alright, alright."
299,You know what gets me really hot? Talking about my mother‚Äôs vagina.
300,And I'm stil single :(
301,It's my birthday today too was up homie altho I see you are having a grander time then me
302,"This implies you were just born, and about to be put back after dinner."
303,Only way to make this better is if it‚Äôs the same vagina!
304,Sex 2 days before valentines
305,This girl doesn‚Äôt beat around the bush eh...  just straight to the roots.

316,Ha. I've seen this in Texas too.
,comment
0,Wow must be nice to spend it with someone
1,Never heard of it.
2,Beat Hazard and Crypt of the Necrodancer
3,There is an audiosurf 2 :3c
4,"Crypt looks ridiculously hard, but comes highly recommended. Haven't seen anything about Beat Hazard, not even a Let's Play, so I'll check that out."
5,"For the record, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rogue-lite game."
6,"Ikr, I feel with the technology available today and a decent mod support, it could be the ultimate multiplayer universe simulator. Would never need another game ever again.... hmm... maybe that's why."
7,"While it isn't spore 2, I would recommend looking at thrive by revolutionary games. They have big plans for it although it isn't much yet."
8,"Oh so you like EA games?
Name every microtransaction"
9,Hasn't it taken them like seven years to create the cell stage beta?
10,Life.
11,"hahaha, thats true!"
12,"Everyone: What‚Äôs up with HL3?

Steam: Here‚Äôs a VR sex game."
13,I think people love it so much because of the building style and all of the minigames online has to offer. I have never played subnautica but I'll try it out soon to compare it to minecraft's survival mode.
14,"I agree, Minecraft survival is fun but I tap out at maybe 2-3 hours per week, but I think it has massive potential in the form of mods and major updates"
15,Thats why there is things called mods in most survival games  so you can make the game better in survival ways
16,"     I find that minecraft drives it praise from the fact that its simplicity paired with good mechanics, provide hours of fun with friends. I dont think subnautica is the best thing to compare minecraft to as it is much less simple and is usually single player."
17,"As far as survival goes, the base game is not challenging without mods. But keep in mind, Minecraft would not get the praise it does without the creative mode. You may not be a creative person, but go see some of the amazing things people have made with it, mods or not:

https://youtu.be/yPxcldEDHts

It definitely deserves the praise."
18,I don‚Äôt like to play alone but it‚Äôs hella fun with a bunch of friends
19,"I grew up when minecraft didnt existed I played TES 3, and it was fun"
20,"I played a lotttt of Minecraft
But since i found mods it was Extra fun"
21,"Blah, blah, blah, Minecraft good. Fortnite bad."
22,A truly amazing game shouldn't require modding to be fun.
23,I 100% that its creative mode is prolly the most accessible and well designed creation tool ever in gaming my complaints lie with the base game.
24,Minecraft pretty alright Fortnite bad
25,"People mod gta all the time it‚Äôs all in your playing style, how old are you? Most of us grew along with Minecraft"
26,I grew up with minecraft as well ever since it was first released on xbox 360
27,Have you played it ever since it released to 360
28,yea just yesterday actually
29,No have you played from day 1
30,from console day one yes
31,Doom

34,Steamrolling an opposing nation and conquering a continent in Civ is pretty damn empowering
35,Any dynasty warrior game. :)
36,X-Plane 11
37,Destiny 2. I taught my son to raid and flawless end game content. He‚Äôs 7. Nothing makes me feel more powerful than raising the next generation of guardians.
38,"(In)famous 1 & 2. That electric superpower is so cool. No weapons, you are the weapon. If that doesn't make you feel powerful I don't know what would.

Also doom and titanfall."

49,Hell yes!
50,"God of War, Bayonetta, Dante's Inferno.

MMMm sooo good."
51,Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2!
52,"Gaming with my son is awesome!

I like to imagine the future is just all of our collective ancestors playing video games together."
53,"There's a reason Insomniac made such a solid Spiderman game it is because of how much love and effort they put into the infamous serious first.

My favorite Infamous was Second Son."
54,"I remember when Max Payne and the Matrix games introduced bullet time.

I thought it was so fucking cool to run and wall jump spin kick a bad guy in the face.

And you know what? It is fucking cool!"
55,The Force Unleashed 1 & 2 are great gems!
56,"Did you ever play Titan Quest?

Similar themes to God of War but with a Diablo-style gameplay system."
57,I'm just waiting on the expansion for Sw/Sh so I can expand my living dex and maybe do more shiny hunting ( got burned out after I finished my shiny comp team )
58,King K. Rool here. Long live the king!
59,Pirate Warriors 3!
60,He takes my skill and suggestions and bends them in ways I can fathom. He‚Äôs the kind of player to make a point of helping people. I‚Äôm grateful for that.
61,"No, but now i know haha, thanks  for the suggestion"
62,"My son is like ""Dada, SEE!?"" and then he points to his mario maker level that I then have to play. He's 3 :)"
63,It's usually pretty cheap on steam and goes on sale all the time. If you don't want to drop the cash now I suggest adding it to your wishlist and just waiting for it to be $5 or less.
64,Start em young. He began with Mario and deleting my destiny 1 guns lol. He plays a pretty wide variety. He cleared his first raid at 6. And continues to set new bars. His goal is to play with Gladd one day.
65,"This is a really common problem / theme in this sub. I have also tried asking, but I‚Äôve hard hardly any luck finding something that‚Äôs couch co-op. 

I‚Äôve just been making everyone play overcooked with me. It‚Äôs fun, lighthearted, and is a good game to see how well you work together."
66,Speedrunners is a cool couch co-op game with support for up to 4 players
67,Enter the gungeon has fun 2- player couch coop. Also stick fight is an amazing 4-player game
68,Borderlands is always great for coop/splitscreen
69,"The new Call is Duty has couch co-op. I have seen it in the menus but never in action. 

My wife and I really like Overcooked on my Xbox. Pretty fun. There‚Äôs definitely fewer options these days."
70,"On Xbox I‚Äôve tried:
Overcooked
Munchkin (and other silly brawlers)
Rocket League"
71,Many of the LEGO games are good co-op experiences. They‚Äôre geared for kids but can still be fun to play with a friend
72,"You can try Human: Fall Flat. Itsfun and chill, and I really enjoyed playing it with my friends!"
73,"7 Days to Die is a ""Minecraft meets zombies"" survival/crafting game that offers both online play and couch co-op. My wife and I play it pretty often together."
74,maybe RE6
75,Yes
76,That only game I've ever played that gives me headaches and makes me nauseous.  That art style in motion is horrid to me.
77,"I never would have considered Call of Duty, but if you could play online in splitscreen, then that would be cool.  

I feel like we wouldn't get much playtime out of overcooked.  I've watched a lot of gameplay and it seems like a $10 game to me."
78,"I forgot that I had wanted to look at 7 Days to Die.  I really want it on my PC, but if I want to play it with my girlfriend, I'll have to buy it on PS4 too.  I think I was trying to avoid buying the same game twice.  That defiantly seems like a good option.  Might be a bit too slow paced when Resident Evil 6 is an option."
79,"Developer was sick, we have to deploy ir anyway. Long story."
80,First witcher comes to mind.
81,Neverwinter nights 2
82," The Witcher 1-3

Greedfall

Btw Dragon Age had isometric view on PC, so naming something like the amazing Divinity Original Sin 2 is valid too."
83,Mass effect maybe? Console it pc view?
84,Baldur's Gate 2
85,"DOOM 2016 is an absolutely incredible game. At $15 its an absolute STEAL. 

DOOM 2016 is the best FPS i have ever played."
86,2016 is a solid game. I like it
87,It's definitely worth it's $15 dollar price tag so if u can swing it then do it üëç
88,Buy it
89,Yes
90,"It's great, you should definitely get it. Doom Eternal has some new stuff in the mechanics which may change the feel a bit, make it more tactical, 2016 is pure raging instinct for the most part."
91,"Totally worth it.
Amazing game."
92,"Just finished it on PC, awesome awesome game. Do buy"
93,F‚Äòin buy it now!
94,"Alright, since everyone can't help but praise this game I guess it's worth it. Thanks for replies everyone. I'll buy it tomorrow. üòä"
95,If you got Xbox I thinks it's on Xbox game pass
96,buy Animal Crossing
97,Well if it's as good as you and everyone else say it is I guess it's worth it.
98,Doom 2016 that is
99,"Buy both, they're very similar."
100,"Doom dosen't have Froggy Chair,maybe as a DLC ?"
101,"*n√§men se man p√•, en svenne*"
102,Region locked?
103,Some codes are. Like a lot of game keys are
104,Can confirm it's on sale on PS4 (US).
105,It‚Äôs a dollar cheaper on PS4
106,"Ubi store has it for 10 euro, where are y‚Äôall seeing this?"
107,On which online store is it sold for PC?
108,Ubisoft
109,"I wish I could have fell in love with it like everyone else, just couldn't after playing it for a few hours"
110,It‚Äôs a great game with a huge world to explore
111,"I‚Äôm about 6 hours in. I love it so far. I also started watching the Netflix show. Geralt is a pretty bad ass character. 

Oh make sure to kill all the cows and animals you find. It helps you get money early on!"
112,"Be ready for 100+ hours of playtime. I‚Äôm still working on it since it came out on GamePass. 140+ for me so far, I haven‚Äôt even started the DLC."
113,have fun buddy
114,Wish you the best journey!
115,You are looking at an amazing playthrough
116,"It wasn't for me, but I hope you enjoy it."
117,Jealous you‚Äôre getting to experience this for the first time. Absolute masterpiece.
118,The first and the best!
119,Good to see more people digging into this hidden gem
120,"I‚Äôm not a very big fan of RPGs but this is on Game Pass and ive heard really good things about so, I‚Äôm giving it a try."
121,"I have the same problem, and I *know* it's me not the game...

To each their own I guess. I should probably go read the books."
122,"Same here. I've tried twice.

I don't think it's a bad game, or tell people they're wrong for liking it because I didn't, but it's not for me. At least, it's not a game I liked enough to play for 80-100 hours, when I have tons of other games to play and books I want to read.

I remember being so excited when The Witcher II finally came out for Xbox. I rushed to the store to get it, brought it home and just couldn't get into it. I normally love RPGs, and fantasy RPGs, but the preparation, spells and difficulty aren't for me.

Got The Witcher III for free, but couldn't get into it both times.

The gameplay is a bit rough, as well."
123,Yeah. I‚Äôm really really looking forward to it.
124,Thanks
125,The best advice.
126,"""Hidden gem""??!?!!

The Witcher series is one of the most hyped and recognized names in computer game history. There's a TV show based on it. How is this hidden?"
127,"The movement kills me. I love Skyrim but the big reason I think I don't like Witcher is how restrictive the movement feels in comparison. It's just not for me

I really wish I could like it, the characters are really flushed out and enjoyable"
128,"Try not to rush through the main quest line, side quest are just as fun"
129,"thatsthejoke.jpg

Not saying it's funny, but that joke is made basically everytime the game is posted on here."
130,"Witcher 3 was not but Witcher was, especially since it was a PC only release."
131,"It's the spells, the strategy, the before battle preparation, and that type of thing that doesn't interest me. I don't want to have to prepare for each battle, or remember tons of things."
132,What game is that from? I know I've seen that hint before.
133,This takes me [back. ](https://doomwiki.org/w/images/thumb/6/6a/Protip.jpg/250px-Protip.jpg)

139,I think it‚Äôs WoW.
140,"also left handed. unless gaming on m&kb truly feels awkward, you prob just suck. most people grow up using a mouse in their right hand. you become used to it."
141,I mean ya probably just suck but a right handed mouse on a lefty ain't helpin
142,"one thing to note is that there are different styles and shapes of mice. i had a lot of trouble aiming when i first started gaming on my pc because i bought some razer mouse that everyone said was good. when my dad needed a new mouse for his pc, i bought him a used logitech mx518 because it was cheap. i remember testing it out on my pc and there was an immediate improvement. the difference mouse shape, weight, and speed makes is huge.

could left vs right handed mice make a difference? sure. but my guess is mouse grip, shape, and dpi matter a lot more. it might take some experimenting to find a store that has all types of mice but i would definitely walk in and try to see how some mice feel if you can"
143,"Can confirm as Im left handed. 

We got it rough. The world is a backwards place to us southpaws. 

Gotta force yourself to become ambidextrous only way youll survive"
144,I agree with you that you become used to it but what if it's easier lefthanded. Like I can throw a ball or write with my right hand but it won't be nearly as accurate or precise as if I used my left. What if it's the same for a mouse a and keyboard
145,"> What if it's the same for a mouse a and keyboard

only way to know for sure is to try it"
146,"Its only that way because you have way more experience using the left to write. Youre welcome to get a left ganded moyse and train yourself to use it.

As a lefty, i dont have any issues using a regular mouse on my right hand."
147,Bro I'm highly considering idk how I've never thought about this
148,But if you write right-handed for long enough you'll see improvements. This really is jsut a concept of a higher level of potential. Like could I be eventually better using a lefthanded mouse than if I just stuck with right? This actually has me questioning everything I've done in life
149,"You could swap the mouse to the left side? Just to see how it feels before you buy a ""left handed mouse"""
150,How far we've come.
151,"
OH how I miss playing quake"
152,"its not that difficult, you just learn your enemies attack pattern then you dodge and hit. mind you its not that easy"
153,"The approach is very similar to Cuphead. The bosses have patterns and tells and you have a variety of weapon choices to match your play style.

If you have the patience to S rank Cuphead, you've probably got the patience for Dark Souls."
154,"The start is probably the hardest part of darksouls. The games tend to give you little guidance, and almost everything murders you instantly. Once you get past that part (and I recommend reading a beginners guide to at least understand how your carry weight effects your dodge roll), you'll probably be ok. And you can start to grind some enemies to level up and make it easier for yourself.

So in essence, the hardest part of Dark Souls is having the patience to keep trying for the first couple of hours until everything clicks. If your patient, then give it a try.

I'm not the best gamer (probably average at best) but I got through DS2 and DS3 ok (I played DS1 first, got completely lost and never came back to it)"
155,"The biggest thing I had to learn is that Dark Souls is not a hack‚Äôn‚Äôslash. I was getting ruined early on by just running up and trying to attack enemies. It takes more care and patience than that at first, until you learn enemy behavior. Then you can go for it. I loved the world so much that I stuck with the challenge, and you might as well."
156,I've been looking for a game to occupy my time til doom eternal so dark souls remastered is the game ive most been considering
157,"Because its an RPG you can use stats to your advantage. Get a bit more health or strenght and you can beat the boss that was a wall for the last few days. Dark Souls is also pretty open, so if you are stuck on a boss you can try another way and come back later. the semi open world gives you the opportunity to discover hidden paths or hidden items. Its a great experience but different than the type of games you mentioned. Try to ignore the people telling you how easy everything is. The thing is the boss i got stuck on might be different than the one you find difficult. Just go for it and enjoy:-)"
158,"I‚Äôve never played cuphead so I don‚Äôt know. From what I can tell they‚Äôre very different games. However, Dark Souls isn‚Äôt as hard as people tend to say. There‚Äôs just a big learning curve, but once you get a feel for it it‚Äôs not bad. I would compare it to playing an old Megaman game or something. At first it seems impossible, but as you get to know the levels and such it becomes easier and you start dying less."
159,"Cuphead is pretty easy.   
I didn't even finish Nioh or any of the Dark Games to be honest.

Might be a 2D versus 3D thing..."
160,Darksouls is not a massively hard game it‚Äôs challenging and requires you to think like all games should journalists just scream and shit themselves if a games harder than press A to win so it‚Äôs been blown wildly out of proportion.
161,Well I beat dark souls and quit cuphead so you should be fine
162,So basically the same approach you take to cuphead but with an added dimension
163,"yep, basically"
164,"It's not really three dimensional, even. Jumping isn't used in combat."
165,"Looks amazing, which game?"
166,Cat will now 'help' you aim.

195,Ah yes the boys pockets have bombs
196,They get two big chest pockets
197,"And it's a mystery wonderland. Never go into a woman's purse. If she says ""in my purse"" bring her the whole thing... It's a sacred land, and you'll never find it anyway."
198,"Yes true, but maybe I just want to go somewhere without having to carry an extra bag everywhere... My ex-bf could fit both our Switches into a single pocket while I couldn't even have my keys without a bag."

208,"And we want all digital because?.........

I get the convenience of no physical storage, but if you guys really want to do heavy graphics or other filler stuff people sometimes don't care about, i'd like a lite version that has LESS extras so i can still play my game and not take up most of my hard drive.

Or try to find another form of physical media to help with both storage problems? (Not likely...... full digital DOES eliminate the used games market which means more money in company's pockets.)"

267,Ooh~
268,Well if you actually get to kill other players then it‚Äôs fun.
269,Does it seriously bother you that other ppl like to play different things?
270,"Yeah, I don't get it either. I miss the old school deathmatch type of games with instant respawning."
271,Cos other people enjoy playing it...
272,"I think I enjoy them mainly just because it is something different from what I normally play. I dont play every day. Sometimes I dont play for months. But it nice to play every once in a while if you dont take it super seriously.

Edit: side note I feel like teammates work alot better together in like apex legends then they do in most multiplayer. It is hard to survive alone doing it with teammates is easier so it benefits you to work together."
273,"People enjoy different things. Things you find fun, there will always be people who find it boring."
274,"I think the fps genre was a little stale, we needed a mix up and battle royals actually fit that need quite well."
275,"Im actually not enjoying normal mp compared to battle royale

At least i only die once per game

Im crap at both but its always better with friends"
276,"Most fps players are campers and cowards. This is why we moved from fast paced arena shooters like Quake and Unreal into this crap once player base broadened.

And there is no better game for campers and cowards than battle royale. You don't move very often. You don't need friends or cooperation. You always sit and camp behind something. And you are not rewarded for combat except the very end. And even at the end everyone try to wait out the opposition.

So it's a perfect game for most people out there."
277,I guess you never get that chicken dinner.
278,"Some people have ADD, some people don't. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I personally love BR games. You gotta drop and find a gun quick before the players around you find one, then you have to kill all those players, then you have to load up and navigate to the circle without dying, etc etc. Idk, being the last person/team out of 100+ players is pretty cool. There's a certain set of skills that are required outside of the prerequisites like having good aim. It's not a mindless shoot em up, there's some planning and situational awareness involved. Also a good team chemistry is critical."
279,"It's not really for me unless I play with friends. If i had to guess, it's because it's different from things made over the previous decade and it gets the adrenaline going when the number of people remaining dwindles down."
280,Battle Royalle is just a standard elimination deathmatch modified to hold more players.
281,"I'm not big on FPS games or BR type games. Just killing repeatedly gets boring and BR games are just FPS with a twist.

But everyone has their own taste so whatever. Let the people game."
282,Its fun to keep dying and piss off my team mates who have to run across the map to revive me.
283,">only to be killed without even knowing what happened

they enjoy it because not everyone is as bad as you"
284,Until you die and your friends keep playing without you and then you can keep watching them or stop playing because you feel left out.. I know that feeling.
285,"I used to camp a lot but guess what it gets boring fast, yes you get many kills but after awhile it isn't fun anymore and you just want to take an smg and start running around."
286,Sounds like legendary gameplay.
287,I may not be good but outta the 100 people only 1 will win.
288,They can still revive and or win
289,That's a late stage. After that you quit battle royale because you realize that arena shooters give you exactly that. Constantly. Without downtime.
290,It really is
291,Every game with winners has only 1 winning player or team.
292,"That's not how it works.. in battle royale only one player really wins, in games like COD or BF  either your team wins or not it's all about the score."
293,"In Battle Royalle games, only one player or team wins (Some BR games do have teams)

In games like COD or BF, only one team wins. 

What is the difference?"
294,Operation Flashpoint?
295,Splinter cell ?
296,sounds like splinter cell
297,Was it a rainbow six game?
298,Ghost recon advanced war fighter? It fits the description.
299,"Sounds like an early Ghost Recon game to me...before Advanced Warfighter...where the series went wrong the first time, IMO."
300,Sniper or something?
301,"No, but that looks solid."
302,"No. More long range, tactical, less stealth."
303,"No. It was more tactical and less stealth. 

Those a great games to play when you can‚Äôt have Metal Gear though."
304,"If Tom Clancy, maybe Splinter Cell."
305,"I mean it‚Äôs almost unfair to compare them, it‚Äôs like saying what‚Äôs better the original Super Mario Bros or Uncharted 4."
306,SMB3 this isn't even a question.
307,"But, in the end, what game do you think is better between Mario 3 and Shovel Knight."
308,Shovel knight
309,"And how would you rate, from 0 to 10,  both Shovel Knight and Mario 3? Both are fantastic, distinctive and unique pinnacles of 2D platforming. Did you also vote in the strawpoll? Please, don't forget to vote. Sorry if I'm being annoying."
310,"My favorite is INCONSISTENT cutscene graphics/cinematic trailers.

FF7 on PS1:

Intro: ""Oooo, pretty.""

Gameplay: ""Blocky.""

Random Cutscene #1: ""Blocky.""

Random Cutscene #2: ""Blocky, some details.""

Random Cutscene #3: ""Beautiful background, blocky characters on top.""

Random Cutscene #4: ""Holy crap, graphic artist showing off super details and amazing animation!""

327,Watching a WoW trailer or expansion trailer vs. Playing the game.
328,We should be grateful it also applied to Mega Man.
329,"Aw shit Fresh comic off the digital print! 

Level 5 monsters be like that in mmo"
330,And AAA games DLC trailers
331,*cough cough* GTA online *cough cough*
332,"The fake gameplay ads are horrible, too. 

""Can you save the princess??? Only the top 1% can pass this level!!!""

Actual game: Hero Wars / Homescapes"
333,Hit the gym. Then your character will be strong.
334,This is pretty much how I looked playing with transformers action figures as a kid
335,It like E3 game trailers
336,The top comic almost looks playful and less 'let's slay the monsters'.
337,Especially strange when you got your custom character wearing a mishmash of armors in the cinematic cutscene.
338,"It's the advertisements man.

 They don't even show you the game you're acctually going to be playing, just some weird imagining of that game.

Whoever thought it would be a stellar idea to advertise a game that looks better in the preview than the actual game is laughing right now, and most likely rolling In that sweet sweet mobile money."
339,"And they never showcase the 100 in game currencies, half of which are paid or require 5000 hours of gameplay to get one unit."
340,"""Amazing and innovative gameplay!"" Autoplay feature."
341,"When you click on an ad like that, you are ordering well-cooked steak. You shouldn't be expected to enjoy it when the game serves you hot dogs."
342,Sometimes the ads in mobile games are ENTIRELY DIFFERENT GAMES BEING PLAYED than the actual game you are eventually downloading.
343,Ah reality is often dissapointing.
344,"*looks that this was post in gaming*
Oh time to sort by controversial to see assholes"
345,"Even Grafo is endorsing Raid: Shawdow Legends the new epic Mobile game everyone is playing. Did I mention you get a free powerful legend if you use promo code ""Edit"""

356,I feel The Old Republic vibes from that too :D (if we exclude Blizzard)
357,"""Ha ha, Fooled you!""

358,But it really is impressive when the game makes you feel the top panel while looking like the bottom one.
359,Try the lol mobile when is comes out looks fun
360,Those baby gameplay snakes are adorable.
361,"There are a few exceptions. Like Honkai Impacts Ads and cinematics are pretty accurate to the actual gameplay for the most part. Which is pretty surprising for a mobile game.

But yeah, kind of sad when the actual game doesn't live up to the cinematic stuff. Looking at you Dawn of War 3!"
362,"Uh, Mr. /u/SrGrafo, sir.  I have an unrelated question. Is it pronounced ‚ÄúSir Grafo‚Äù or ‚ÄúSe√±or Grafo‚Äù?"

407,I see a video game trailer now that's pre-rendered I automatically think it's a mobile game.
408,Currently playing KH3 and the cinematic to gameplay graphics is flawless and beautiful. I was playing Birth By Sleep before that and it's a jarring comparison.
409,"A lot of games have been going to in engine cutscenes, which I'm less a fan of mostly because they just dont look as good as prerendered. During gameplay you're focused on more than  how it looks so you dint notice the minor problems but during cutscenes your whole focus is on the shot so you notice every single clipping problem and shitty texture."
410,Every MMO ever

418,I'd still play that bottom frame game...
419,Botw is so good at boss fight transitions.
420,"On console/PC games, the pre-rendered cinematics usually don't hold up to scenes that are being rendered in real time. Probably why rockstar uses actual assets in real time for cutscenes."
421,May be just me but when I played Infinite Warfare I felt the campaign‚Äôs cutscenes looked much better than the actual gameplay
422,WoW
423,"So when does the ad start playing along with loot boxes, gachas, up coming events, current events, new characters announcement, deals in the shop and notification to restarting app for # GB update?"
424,Too true

429,Download Raid shadow...
430,"So in the cinematic, they're lovingly gazing into each other's eyes, but the gameplay has them fighting?  Wow, that is a pretty dramatic difference.  Bait and switch!"
431,I love how most mobile games go with with this route of ads or just say that their game is a pull pin game.
432,"My favourite is when you looking at a game on steam and EVERY single screenshot and video are of cut scenes. 

It doesn't speak well of your game if you're not even confident enough to show us gameplay."

440,"Or the opposite, when you play an older game and the dusty BinkVideo cutscenes are noticeably worse than the fully-patched game on Ultra setting."
441,I would totally play that mobile game!
442,This post was brought to you by Raid: Shadow Legends
443,"I recently had this happen. Was getting ads for one game that didn't look fun initially but I saw it enough times that I downloaded it. Game involved saving a guy from multiple forms of death with a puzzle type situation.

Then, I downloaded the thing and it was just a Candy Crush clone, which had nothing to do with the ""do the puzzle, save the guy"" aspect. It was literally a polar opposite of what I wanted."
444,Anybody say Raid Shadow Legends? Mafia City?
445,Mobile ads are the ùëæùë∂ùëπùë∫ùëª!!!
446,Reminded me of Kate Upton in that mobile AoE knockoff.
447,The Metal gear franchise basically.
448,Anthem?
449,Ain‚Äôt it the truth
450,Sponsored by: Invasion Darkness Myths
451,The graphics for snake have improved so much!
452,When games spend more on the trailers graphics then the games themselves
453,What about the games with live action cutscenes? Command and conquer says hi.
454,"Have you heard about raid shadow legends,  cause i haven't. And im very curious about it"
455,"  Yup, the cut scene with Cloud on the motorcycle was incredible (by the standards of PS1).  Tifa pushing Cloud on the wheelchair was barely an improvement over the game-play."
456,Or just a game without cutscenes altogether.
457,probably every 3d square rpg has this to some degree. also weird is when some cutscenes are voice acted and others aren't
458,Are you talking about reforged
459,"I prefer the beautiful all over games that don‚Äôt actually pre-render their cutscenes. They just load in the models and have them do the script. MHW did this very well, as an example of a modern game."
460,"They were literally making it up (processes, standards, plugins for primitive 3D rendering programs) as they went along. Different teams improved at different rates, and submitted scenes in different orders. Sure, generally by the final disk the graphics were vastly improved, but like you said, there was a lot of inconsistency along the way and a lot of FMVs.  

They couldn't pick one because every choice they made literally changed the landscape they were working on."
461,"Also, cutscenes that clearly depict a different character design, or weapons that the character doesn't have equipped anymore. Painkiller managed to be even weirder by having some cutscenes happen mostly in completely the wrong levels."
462,This is one of the reasons a lot of people appreciated GTA V. The cutscenes in that game were exactly like when you played the game. There was no difference in visual quality and it was nice.
463,Well that's how ff7 actually was
464,That‚Äôs somethings that‚Äôs bothered me with a lot of final fantasy games lol. Same thing with kingdom hearts.... almost like they have something in common

494,But those dance moves on the sub though
495,"Ha, I've been playing Trails of Cold Steel recently and while the cut scenes are consistent, whether or not a line is voice acted seems to be completely arbitrary. Like, even in the same scene some lines from the same character will be voiced and others not with no discernable pattern as to why what line is voiced."
496,Honestly I just thought it was a fake ad for this comic

I wrote Burger King every week for several months asking if they would please start selling burger king masks.  They never responded but about six months into the campaign they started selling them.  I don't know if I did it or if its a weird coincidence but I bought one.  Still have it actually.

Mmorpgs= maybe writing, story telling, but also collecting possibly. It could be reliant on the MMO. PVP= maybe try larping or other sports. 

Video games are pretty much escapist fantasy, with some power fantasy or (things I literally couldn't do or I would die or go to prison. (CS:GO could transition to paintball or lasertag, but i'll be damned if you could find a good transition from Payday or Payday 2. 

Big problem with any hobby is cost. But as someone who plays games, you likely already know that."

658,"Set aside time in the weekends or whenever you're free. Maybe ask your girlfriend if you can spend more time with her on a saturday or sunday so you then use the other day to have more uninterrupted gaming time.

Basically reshuffle it. Sounds like right now your schedule is fairly chaotic."
659,"It sounds like it's not even a question of gaming to me. It sounds more like you need time for yourself to relax and unwind.

I've had talks with my fiance about me and games. I'm one that essentially recharges when I'm alone by myself. So what I did is I spoke to her about it and set aside days where I won't touch games at all and I just spend time with her. I also do the same for myself, where I just come home and speak to her for a rather small amount of time and I go play for a few hours usually. She doesn't like it but she understands and respects my need for my alone time away from people. She's still in the other room, so she's mostly okay with it!

I think you just need to sit down with her and talk to her about it. If she's right for you, then she should understand. She may not like it, but people need their own time to unwind and relax. It's very important for ones mental health."

If so, maybe instead of playing games, you may find interesting watch someone else playing them, like a youtuber or a streamer. I know, watching isn't the same as playing yourself, but if you don't have free time, what else you could do? You will get to know the story of those games, you will have a ""virtual partner"" who also enjoy and talk about those games and gaming in general, and thanks to that stopping some stress... Idk, that sounds like killing various problems with just one bullet"

>I don‚Äôt have many people that understand my enjoyment of video games.

This bugs me a lot.  My hubby and I are gamers, me more so than him in fact.  But we still occasionally hear about how videogames are immature despite the quantity of titles which are rated 18+, or that they're pointless/stupid, to which I can't help but think: ""Really Karen? You're watching Gordie Shore* but my hobby is stupid?"" Videogames increase cognitive function (puzzle solving, reflexes, leadership skills, memory, etc.) whilst most TV shows do not. 

*insert reality show of choice

>To them I‚Äôm just irresponsible for wanting to play

Everyone needs downtime.  Whether it's getting your nails done, blasting along the road on your motorbike, reading a magazine or playing a computer game: we all need to decompress.  If they really can't understand that your preferred way to de-stress is videogames then there's something wrong with them not you.  

Sounds like you need to plan out your week and readjust your time and priorities. Your family and GF should understand that for two evenings a week you require alone time to do whatever the heck you fancy before you burn out. Suggest your GF hangs with her family/friends that night or see if she'd be willing to try some coop games (A Way Out, Overcooked or pick a Lego game in a franchise she likes)."
664,"I wake up at six and last night I went to sleep at about three in the morning so I could get two or three hours of gaming in. I do things like this a lot to find time, but I‚Äôm always putting something off to play, be it homework or talking/hanging out with someone/or mostly sleep."
665,Yeah. It can be. Especially because we have one car for three people‚Äôs schedules.
666,"Yeah. You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôll try bringing that up, she‚Äôs really nice and I doubt she‚Äôll have any issue with it. I just feel bad asking if I can play games instead of spending time with her."
667,"I don‚Äôt know why but I‚Äôve never liked to make schedules like that. Not even just not like, I actively avoid it. Maybe it‚Äôs time to change that and set time aside for everything."
668,"It‚Äôs a thirty minute drive to work, so not far at all. But from there I work then go to class, then back to work, then, etc. you get it. Not a lot of time to watch games instead of playing, but you‚Äôre right. I should try that when doing homework or something."
669,"Hahaha. Yeaaah. That is something I think about. I‚Äôm busy now, but realistically speaking life won‚Äôt get less busy with time. Welllp, cross that bridge, I guess."
670,"I agree soooo much with all that. I feel like people really see games as this childish thing when it‚Äôs NO DIFFERENT than watching a show for ten hours, except video games are more interactive! But anyway. Yeah. I need to make a schedule. That seems to be the consensus. Thank you. Good luck to you though. I‚Äôm not having kids for a while, but I already know they‚Äôll be ‚Äútime consuming‚Äù(that sounds too negative. I assume you love your kid/s and I will when I wind up having my own)"

706,How
707,"Personally loving the new modern warfare, I‚Äôve put in hundreds of hours in just a couple months. 

Planetside 2 is about to get an AMAZING new update and might interest you. 

I‚Äôve really, really enjoyed No Man‚Äôs Sky recently. It‚Äôs not a traditional FPS game, but the thing that makes it great is playing with friends. It‚Äôs a whole lot of fun, especially in VR. 

If you‚Äôre looking for some slower paced action games, EVE online is fun if you can get through learning all the menus. There‚Äôs a handful of video guides, and a quick google search will find you in game clans designed to, and full of people willing to help you through anything you want to know. 

For a great story, there‚Äôs the Witcher series of games. Not much I can say about it, I‚Äôve played a ways in and the story seems very rich. 

Finally, and this is the big one. Save up 400 USD, and get a VR headset, if you don‚Äôt typically get very sick doing things like that. I firmly believe that VR is the future of gaming, and we already have games that will likely be classics akin to Half Life. (Boneworks) 

With Half Life Alyx releasing (IIRC next month) it will mark a turning point in gaming, and we will see within 2 years a flood of AAA titles in VR, but until then there‚Äôs so many good games that you can play. I recommend No Mans Sky, Boneworks and Pavlov. 

But of a rant but that‚Äôs about it, I hope I helped provide some games you might want to play."
708,Play the soulsborne series.
709,"Drakengard and Nier series have good soundtracks if you're looking for an extra playlist.

Red Dead Redemption 2 maybe? The writing is solid and the general world building is very well done. The characters are diverse with both likeable and less favorable characters. The soundtrack is also really fitting."
710,"EVE online sounds intresting, sorry but for not specifying, but I'm looking for a game with rich story and likeable characters. Or even cool gameplay"
711,go to the swamps and hunt ducks. simple.
712,More like primitive rust players
713,Minus the fact animals never spawn
714,It's ok. Better than the recent ones. Not as good as the old ones. Unless you are really into cod or desperate for an fps to play go ahead and skip imho.
715,The shooting is great but it‚Äôs just not the same as COD4 and MW2
716,"As someone who's only played till MW2. Id say it's worth it. With season 2 introducing older MW2 maps. I can't complain,it's a CoD game. It get the job done. And to relive the toxic, salty lobbies is 10/10 I would recommend"
717,Best cod I've played. Still has it's issues but if you enjoyed MW1-3 you'll love this one.
718,"Don't take it as Full cod game. it's slower than previous years but more intense. The devs are in top of the game with community support and patches. there are a lot of things to unlock. The operation mode was an after though so don't even try it. The single player is great the multiplayer is good . Not great but is good.  If you can get it between 30 and 40 dollars, buy it."
719,I would say it‚Äôs fast paced like the newer cods but also keeps the more careful playstyles and difficult combat system. I enjoy it but not as much as the old ones.
720,"Meh. Honestly, I'd just wait for the Battle Royale mode if you're into those. It's rumored to be free to play and should be coming out pretty soon."
721,I liked it. But its not really worth the full price. I'd wait for like a christmas price drop or something.
722,It‚Äôs fun except for campers which are abundant but it just doesn‚Äôt hit the same feels as playing the older older cods
723,Last cod game was bo 1 i got this with my 2070 super guess its decent
724,a serious let down compared to mw3
725,Game has horrible spawns it‚Äôs like the game engine has forgot how to play team deathmatch this year.....
726,"it's pretty good, closer in playstyle to mw2 or cod4, but definitely not as good"
727,"My personal favorite CoD is W@W, then MW2 as a close second. So use that to quantify my opinion here:

I think MW2019 is one of the better entries MP wise. Much better than Ghosts and IW (I HATED those). But not nearly as good as W@W or MW2. I would say it is closer to MW3/OPS3 in terms of overall fun/enjoyment in my eyes. Better than Ops4, MW Remaster, and barely better than WW2.

There isn't a shit ton of content, but it fills the gap. 
The story was fun and had some nice themes going. The overall package works, especially if you can get it on sale."
728,The same as the last 10 call of duty games. Filled with campers and killstreaks...
729,Definitely one of the better CoDs with lot of content updates.
730,"Not really worth 175gb disk space yet. Too many broken elements on MP, campaign is really good though."
731,Never even touched call of Duty games.
732,What a garbage post.
733,"This is Colonel 100

748,"Bills one of those people afk at the start of game because he's still pissing, fuck you bill"
749,does bill check his memes' grammar before posting?
750,"Yeah but when you drink as many coffees as I do and having the blader the size of a small shrew while also 40yr old, these things all equate to a toilet break every 25 mins. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

770,nothing really
771,Nothing at all
772,"Nothing at all, it's still EA behind the game, and the BioWare of Mass Effect and Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is long gone..."
773,More laughs
774,"The whole thing is a shame. This ""redux"" is what should've been the game that already released and now the better version isn't going to be enjoyed as it should've been. I bet only a quarter of the people that bought the game before are going to bother revisiting it. I know I wouldn't go back."
775,I mean I HOPE for a lot. I expect another failure as with all other post release promises made by bioware
776,Expecting a game not in a alpha or beta at best with some interesting content to keep people engaged. And Owen has to be killed off
777,"Story content, missions, etc."
778,Micro-transactions & Pay To Win.
779,Disappointment
780,"I expect, a fresh new price tag.
Bioware died when their vets left it's just EA now."
781,"Do we talk about what needs to be done or what we can expect? Cause the game needs loads of content, item variety and a way better loot spiral."
782,Absolutely nothing.
783,"What they stated the product would be from the get go. 

What they will actually deliver though, is not going to be that. Expecting to be asked to pay for DLC which gives access to the updates."
784,"Idk man
I just play Destiny 2 all the time so I don't really know"
785,F... *Wipes tears* I'm not crying you're crying
786,"True but at the same time, games like EA Battlefront 2, Destiny 2, No Man‚Äôs Sky and FF14: A realm Reborn have GREATLY benefit from a Redux."
787,"Still, think of how much better it would've been if it was completed from the beginning. 

Anyways, did Battlefront 2 and Destiny 2 really have to redux in this capacity or just update? I don't know because I don't have them. 

No Man's Sky I agree with. 

I didn't say the game wouldn't benefit, but it's still not going to be seen by as many and it's a shame."
788,"The problem with this response is that those games actually had some type vision for they wanted, they just needed more development time.

Anthem had no vision outside of ""Live service, looter shooter, iron Man. Yeah"". The story is shit, the world is cool looking for half a second, the gameplay loop is boring af, the loot was terrible... Essentially what I see with this ""redux"" is actually trying to forge a vision for the game."
789,">but it's still not going to be seen by as many and it's a shame.

With how much people spend on microtransactions and loot boxes, I doubt EA and Bioware will care."

One thing is having safe rooms, the other thing is his footsteps are quite inconsistent with where he actually is, and he can teleport around the station, like one time I heard him going from the S.T.A.R.S. hallway through the Lounge into the Library, and then he suddenly opened the Showers door, even though there is absolutely no way how he could get to Showers so quickly from that side of the map. 

He just made me take so many unnecessary detours I constantly rolled my eyes whenever he appeared. I liked his implementation *after* the police station on the 2nd run when he appears in certain moments and starts a chase, but I hated him in the police station."

Unless you mean the controller to the phone, then it is the Sony app for my phone that connects directly (some sony magic).

Unless you mean the game itself, in which using the Playstation app to remote play.

Hope that answered XD"

961,"Yeah, I was a fucking IDIOT and I pre-ordered it. Biggest gaming mistake I've ever made. I played it the week it launched and immediately hated it. Microsoft refused to give me a refund and Bethesda said I was shit out of luck.

967,"LOL I have the game still sealed in the package.  The Xbox One X FO76 bundle was actually $100 CHEAPER than the console by itself.

A nice bonus is that the packaging was just a special FO76 sleeve over the standard X1X box.  So I disposed of the sleeve and now nobody has to know I bought Fallout 76 :)"

969,My bad indeed. Apologies :P
970,"Yeah, you're preaching to the choir. All of those things became obvious on day one and they haven't done a single thing to address it. Todd Howard and his team are a bunch of crooks...

And if I see one more FUCKING re-release of Skyrim for $60.00 I am going to cry."
971,So you didn't even do anything and already decided what you think of the game?

23 main quests, 48 side and \~80 miscellaneous and daily quests.  With a big new batch of main, side and miscellaneous coming with Wastelanders in April. 

&#x200B;

And taking the hour statement as exaggerated hyperbole you wouldn't be geared up enough to take on anyone who has been playing a while without getting your ass handed to you.  And even people of similar level if they have friends who play and know the game can give them perk load outs and gear to kick your ass easily.  


I usually run passive mode but if some low level players is being obnoxious I will turn it off and 2 shot kill them with my 3 star legendary Gauss Rifle.

1011,"I second the FPS thing. In the Dark Souls games, waving means hello, and bowing means hello and prepare to die."
1012,"I dunno, I also spam jump to get peoples attention. Some MMOs have very in depth emotes, so it's not always needed. but in GW2 it was more common to jump at them, or use showy skills at them to get their attention. 

Side note, I just started playing FFXIV on the trial after playing GW2 for years and I really love the style of everything. The lighting, all the armor, the monsters are all awesome from what I've seen. The world feels a lot more 'real' than gw2 felt for me and i like that. Definitely enjoying it so far."

1084,"The dash is supposed to go between die and hard.

Die-Hardman"
1085,Recently watched the Did You Know Gaming Video on him. I believe he found the perfect match making between video game and movie story telling. People complain that Death Standing was too boring but I enjoyed it. He constantly test new ways to go beyond fps games.
1086,"Why is the award in a dull matte finish? I thought it was a shiny silver chrome thing which would make it look much more prestigious- like an Oscar. They base should be a glossy color too. 

Those who won it said it was heavy, so that's a good sign. But in this picture they still look like cheap knockoffs."
1087,That man is an artist
1088,Who is ‚ÄûDiehardman‚Äú and from wich game is he? I‚Äôm really no expert
1089,Metal gear was amazing but death stranding is a pile of dicks
1090,"Why are so many fan-boys obsessed with kojima. I have never heard of any other dev from any of the amazing games I‚Äôve played. This guy gets posted about on Reddit everyday, he‚Äôs a decent dev but nothing to write home about...

Edit: yes, I loved metal gear games my entire life. But please someone attempt to explain the plot to any of the games. I‚Äôd love to hear someone differentiate the different Snakes. I guarantee there will be conflicting explanations about who‚Äôs Solid Snake, who‚Äôs liquid snake, who‚Äôs naked snake etc. or how they are even related, for example."

1095,Nothing wrong with matte.  It's what it represents not the finish.
1096,A national treasure and it's not even my nation.
1097,An overrated writer mind you.
1098,"He's not a dev, he's a writer. And if you've never heard of any other writers or creators, then you just don't pay much attention."
1099,"He's a writer/designer/director so his influence is much stronger than your typical game writers, who usually play an unsung hero role.  Metal Gear was a groundbreaking game and a landmark in the industry, and because Kojima had so much impact on it, the two became synonymous.

Most games are remembered for their gameplay.  Metal Gear is remembered for its writing."
1100,"I don't get the downvotes, he is overrated as shit. The only redeeming character he made was Snake. Mostly because of David Hayter. MGS gameplay was stellar but the writing in them is rage inducting."
1101,"Sure, but I am talking about the looks. I thought it was glossy because that is how I remember seeing it in pictures and video reels. 

No biggie, just surprised. Also, humans like shiny objects. :)"
1102,Please give me an example of some other writers that are posted daily on r/gaming ....
1103,I loved metal gear games and I know him from association with metal gear and death stranding via Reddit. But I wouldn‚Äôt say the writing was my favorite part about metal gear. That‚Äôs the most confusing story ever told. There‚Äôs like 12 snakes and half of them switch sides several times in a single game. Honestly couldn‚Äôt explain any metal gear game to someone even if I tried; despite reading several plot summaries over the years.
1104,Chris Avellone is a pretty famous video game writer.
1105,"The game did pioneer stealth-based action gameplay.  But whatever your favorite part is, the game is known for its writing.  One of the hallmarks of cinematic videogames."
1106,"We used to do this with the oldschool starsiege tribes. Teacher would turn off the internet but not the network during class do people would pay attention but was too lazy to get up and walk around so wouldnt realize  half the class would be in a lan party for the game.

And im not that old, before the released the f2p version they released the earlier one for free and we could play it off flash drives and didnt need a local install. So im old, just not that old haha

Teacher was always confused why people would randomly scream ""shazbot"""
1107,I remember playing Quake III Arena multiplayer with classmates in computer class. That was fun.
1108,"I played counter strike while in lessons at school, I left  17 years ago haha"
1109,"When I was in HS, someone managed to upload Unreal Tournament AND Team Fortress to the main shared drive.

1110,"You renegade maverick, you."

1122,Back in my day.. We bypassed the school It techs block on unauthorized exe's and played doom on the computer classes ibm's
1123,"Damn, it looks 3d!"
1124,I can‚Äôt tell did you draw it or paint the controller?
1125,"It looks great, man!!!"
1126,Noice
1127,Is it a Vault Tec theme?
1128,Came here to say the choice of background is funny since it looks like you are insanely good at drawing Haha. Controller looks sweet tho
1129,A little orange peely on the spray texture but it looks great otherwise. I‚Äôm sure the next one will be smooth as glass.
1130,I truly thought for a second this was hand drawn. Still clean paint job ;)
1131,Very nice!
1132,"Noice! 

And I have those same aftermarket aluminum analogue sticks on my DS5. :D"
1133,Looks like a Fallout version!
1134,Did you use any type of top coat or is it just the color paint?
1135,What kind of paint did you use
1136,"Good job, lad"
1137,I had taken my controller apart last weekend to unjam a sticky Y button. I thought about doing some custom painting. Can you link the guide or list materials that you used for this?
1138,Looks great dude
1139,"I like that finish, I'm guessing you're a dirty Seahawks fan?"
1140,That looks really cool.
1141,"I would love to do this for me and my wife, but I wouldn't know where to start.
Would anyone know of any guides or what type of paints to use or what?"
1142,I'm waiting for your 470th attempt and the controller looks all bloated from layers and layers of paint.
1143,Show this to ur crush and u will get a handjob
1144,What are you going to do to make it not feel sticky?
1145,Why it looks like the controls you can create in xbox design lab
1146,Looks like shit
1147,Did not mean to deceive lol it's not a drawing though. Wish it was...
1148,"He painted on a controller, he didn't paint a 3d image of one."
1149,Haha that's awesome actually. Wish I was that good at drawing. Just some paint though.
1150,Just picked up random colors at the store actually. Once I started I realized they look a bit like the Seahawks colors lol
1151,Was not even thinking of this obviously lol its cracking me up though
1152,"Thank you! Yeah, definitely learned my lesson. Took it as a Bob Ros ""happy accident"". Lol"
1153,"I know, it's been killing me lol should've thought of that. Thank you btw!"
1154,They feel better than anticipated right?
1155,Used some rustoleum enamel
1156,Krylon fusion and rustoleum enamel
1157,"Just use fine grade sandpaper on every surface you want to paint. I used krylon fusion for the blue color and krylon colormaxx for yellow. Was my first time so still not 100% on every decision I made. For instance I personally would use the krylon fusion from now on. Colormaxx seemed not as good. My controller being white, did not need a primer. Keep that in mind also I think. Then finally used rustoleum crystal clear enamel. Couple coats of each btw. Might be a confusing description. Hope this helps!"
1158,Thanks man
1159,Lol Raiders all day...realized the same thing though after my first coat. Knew that color combo looked familiar.
1160,Definitely not bloated. That was my main worry when starting. Was actually surprised that it wasn't bloated. Stop counting my layers!!
1161,Already did. Not a handy in sight.
1162,"I'm sure you could, just wanted to do it myself. Fun project actually."
1163,r/woooosh
1164,looks nice good job
1165,"It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve worked in a spray booth so I feel too rusty to give you serious pointers. But if you keep your hand steady, your distance good, and your viscosity where you want it youll do just fine."
1166,thanks!
1167,Of course keep up the great work
1168,Also it costs like $80 for a custom one so yeah
1169,"Or if he's bored, sand that sucker from 400 to 3000 and use some car polish on it"
1170,got my custom controller for ~$60 when they had a sale
1171,That too

1178,Got mine at Best buy. Works fine so far.
1179,"Get something with a 2070 super in it for that pricepoint and likely everything else in the computer should be fine (if its not a ‚Äúsuper‚Äù, get a 2080). Should have atleast a ryzen 5 or i5 (ryzen 3 or i3 at that pricepoint is a bit low) and id HIGHLY recommend an SSD, even if just a small one for booting. 

I know you dont want to build your own, but if the one youre buying doesnt come with an SSD id buy one and install it in addition to the harderive it comes with, should be less then $100 factor that into the price when you buy.

Id start by looking on newegg.com. Also I really do think you can get the specs I mentioned for that pricepoint (2070 SUPER, ryzen 5/i5, small SSD), i probably wouldnt settle for less for that much. May take some shopping around"
1180,Don't buy a Dell or anything that is impossible to upgrade (they use their own plugs and solder cpu to motherboard)
1181,Gotta love it haha
1182,Some of us don't care to learn.
1183,Thank you for your inputs. My friend nearly recommended the same thing.
1184,I upgraded the cpu on my Aurora. Which desktops have soldered cpus?
1185,Not caring to learn and posting you don‚Äôt have the time is two different things. Be honest if you don‚Äôt want to build it.
1186,Well it's not my post dipshit.
1187,Thank you for the pleasant feedback!
1188,I got to my first cut scene it was 30 fucking minutes
1189,It had 5-10 minutes of game play. It looked nice though
1190,You say that like it's something wrong
1191,"I'm about 35 hours in and so far around 4-5 hours of those at MOST have been cutscenes. It's a story driven game cutscenes are to be expected , actually so far red dead has had waaaaaay more cinematics so i'm kinda disapointed lol"

1198,"Triss is actually a good person, yen is kinda selfish"

152,Does the sound really match this video?
153,A death squad going house to house killing people would have to be of a much larger size. The population would be literally running and scattering in the first minute of shooting.

I have enclosed three locks for you to open as a gift. I have been watching your videos for years, and with each passing day, I become more sure. Your voice calls to me, like an angelic choir. I watch the swift, nimble movements of your fingers and wonder what they would feel like on my own body. Rest assured, my lock is not so easy to pick and will require a good bit of teasing, and maybe a little action from the tension wrench. When I see you post your video of these locks, I will know that the seeds you have planted in me, I have also planted in you.

With love from your #1 fan,

Logan in California"""
162,"I'm definitely fully of the belief these days that no lock is secure - you're just paying for a deterrent. 


And the deterrent isn't to stop someone from breaking into just your property - but to make someone elses look more lucrative."

1,"You're referring to closed captions, though whether there are options to just have the dialogue probably depends on what service you're using. I think Netflix usually has both dialogue-only and closed captions available? Not sure about amazon or all that. Blu-rays typically come with multiple subtitle tracks too."
2,Subtitles and closed captioning are two separate things. I think some physical dvds and blu rays allow for subtitles only.
3,Most foreign-language films only subtitle the dialogue. It seems to the the norm rather than the exception.

18,"The main attraction of They Shoot Pictures Don't They is their comprehensive megalist of the best movies of all time (and another best of the 21st century list), but they also have director profiles that showcase the classic auteurs and newer acclaimed filmmakers."
19,Love the cast but hate that it is for a David O. Russell film. He is an awful human being.
20,Holy hell. This cast is shaping up to be great. Lots of Oscar nominations incoming if the movie delivers.
21,"[One particularly disturbing story comes courtesy of Russell‚Äôs niece (not a blood relative), who filed a police report in 2011 alleging that the actor groped her. According to police reports, the then 19-year-old, who is transgender, was discussing hormones with Russell, after which he ‚Äúput his hands under [her] top and felt both breasts.‚Äù During this same visit to a Florida gym, Russell also allegedly offered to help his niece with ab exercises as his hand ‚Äúhovered above‚Äù her ‚Äúprivate parts.‚Äù While Russell did not face any charges and the case was ultimately closed, the director himself confirmed the incident, attempting to justify his actions by telling the police that she was ‚Äúacting very provocative toward him,‚Äù and that he was ‚Äúcurious about the breast enhancement.‚Äù According to a police report, ‚ÄúRussell stated she is always causing drama since the transgender transformation and has become very provocative and seductive.‚Äù](https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywood-terror-director-david-o-russells-history-of-groping-and-on-set-abuse)"
22,"> Plot details are being kept under wraps on the movie, which will be Russell's return to the director's seat for the first time since 2015's Joy, starring Jennifer Lawrence.

Jamie Foxx & Angelina Jolie are also rumored. This is gonna be an insanely stacked cast and instant awards player."
23,The casting along makes me want to watch thus movie.
24,Is that Steve Harvey?
25,MBJ needs a great director to tap into his talents. His Non-Coogler stuff hasnt been amazing - heres hoping this is a great role for him!
26,Where's Jennifer Lawrence?
27,"Surprised Bale‚Äôs back in after all those reported shouting matches, hopefully Russell has changed his ways. 

Or the allure of easy awards season recognition is too much to pass up"
28,I think Michael B Jordan's role is the one that Foxx was under consideration for
29,Or instant bait.
30,She is free from David O Russell she's her own things.
31,Looks like she passed on the role that went to Robbie.
32,I doubt people like Bale or Lawrence are fazed by Russell's shouting. They're too strong to let him bully them and if they didn't enjoy working with him they wouldn't go back. At this point I think every actor knows what they're getting themselves into by working with Russell.
33,Prob the latter.
34,"I don‚Äôt know much about Russell, is he famous for being an asshole on set? I heard Bale and J-Law got into it with him at one point, but I never knew about what, or even much about him."
35,Here is a good article about him: [https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywood-terror-director-david-o-russells-history-of-groping-and-on-set-abuse](https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywood-terror-director-david-o-russells-history-of-groping-and-on-set-abuse)
36,Nominees usually select which category they want to be considered for.
37,The individual chooses which category they get nominated for.
38,What's a non binary person?
39,"If I were nonbinary, I'd go with ""best actor"" because ""actor"" doesn't necessarily always imply maleness, right? But not being NB I can't speak on it with any degree of authority obviously, it could very well be a trigger for dysphoria that I can never understand."
40,"You‚Äôre assuming that Hollywood is unbiased enough to actually give a leading or great supporting role to an openly non-binary person and nominate them for an award.

But if it does happen, I think it would be like the leading/supporting categories (often unclear if a role is one or the other) and the actor/studio would choose the category where they‚Äôre more likely to win."
41,Someone who doesn‚Äôt identify as male or female.
42,"He had been building resentment towards Park from seeing how he treated people and heard what they said about his smell. The day of the party he was already visibly upset and dissociating, and after he watched his daughter get stabbed he was in a state of shock. When Mr. Park was trying to get his son to the hospital but had to get the keys and was visibly grossed out at the sight/smell it triggered all those pent up feelings in Kim and he just snapped. It was a knee-jerk reaction from a man that had been made to feel lesser than from his upper class employers and was in a state of shock after seeing his daughter stabbed. Even he can't believe he did it afterwards but got caught up in the heat of the moment.

>it wasn't his intention to ignore the fact that Kim's daughter was dying?

He didn't even know that was his daughter so that's not really a factor I don't think. If anything he was probably confused as to why he was helping her and not him."
43,"Maybe this video essay could help.

44,"Ah I see. I feel really bad for Mr Park, he was a jerk but didn't deserve to die."
45,"The podcast was very well produced and acted. The premise was pretty interesting too, but it really didn't do much for me looking back. Maybe it was the medium and it will be a lot more gripping as a movie. I hope this works out well."
46,"J Edgar had hideously bad old age makeup. Leonardo was trying his best to make it work, but the makeup was so awful, some of the serious emotional scenes came off like comedy."

49,"Unless a notably unforgivable example should arise in any of these replies, I can't really think of any. I've never found my enjoyment contingent on ""realness"" as far as effects go. 

If something looks fake I'll likely still get a kick out of it anyway, my standards really aren't that unappeasable. And if I don't, usually there's some pro outweighing the con, like the actor's heart is really in it or what have you."
50,I thought Vice did a pretty good job making Christian Bale look like Dick Cheney.

52,IT 2. Graphics of the non IT monsters (e.g the homeless leper) were terrible. Totally ruined the film for me. I also realise this isn‚Äôt prosthetics but it‚Äôs terrible graphics.
53,"Worst: Danny De Vito's Penguin costume in Batman Returns (1992). He looked like he was wearing something between an inflatable beach ball and a fatsuit. It was only years later that I learned the costume was supposed to make him look hunched over, like penguins do when they are incubating their eggs. Also, his rubber flipper fingers looked like ... well, rubber flipper fingers, and wobbled around very unconvincingly whenever he did anything. There was no attempt at any serious articulation."
54,It still qualifies about the graphics.
55,"As someone who is both young and didn‚Äôt grow up in an English-speaking country, this film proved to me that we do need new adaptations of classic stories once for every new generation.

I‚Äôd never heard of Little Women and I would‚Äôve probably never seen any version of the story it if it wasn‚Äôt for Greta Gerwig."
56,"My favorite bit of /r/MovieDetails trivia about Gerwig's *Little Women* (2019)?

The piano pieces that [Beth plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqIbgxiIknY) in the childhood flashback are '*Papillons, Op. 2*' and '*Kinderszenen*' from Schumann: the first is meant to represent the [fluttering movements at a ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSUCLUniinA&feature=youtu.be&t=531) (like the one that Meg attends in the next scene), while the second is German for '[scenes from a childhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibf6QNjgGU)'.

&#x200B;

...This movie outperforming its estimations in the international box office is encouraging and well deserved"
57,"between this scene at the end where he slams his face on the bench and the scene in Liar, Liar where he smushes his face with the toilet seat, I don't think there's an actor who quite brings exactly the same amount of energy and desire to make you laugh as Jim Carrey.

Over-acting? Sure. But at least it leads to memorable work."
58,I love that movie!
59,"I know, a lot of people were pretty pissed off when the film released cuz there were a lot of artistic liberties.
And we all know just how well Tom Hooper can adapt from source material XD"
60,"I mean, it's Tom Hooper."
61,Im ready for a Rick Moranissance.
62,"It's interesting that this brought him out, not the Ghostbusters offer. I wonder if he felt the script was better or what. In any case, I've really missed Rick and I hope he has a great time on set."
63,"Guess his kids finally grew up, yay!"
64,"> I understand the movie will be made for the theatrical side, not Disney+.

This is huge. His first movie in 24 years and it's getting a theatrical release too. Tought this movie would go straight to Disney+. 

> The movie centers around Gad‚Äôs character who is the son of Moranis‚Äô Wayne Szalinski. Son in aspiring to be a great scientist like his father, accidentally shrinks the kids.

Probably going to be a small role since it's centered around Josh Gad's character but good to see he's now in a place where he's fine with coming back to movies after his wife's death."
65,"Good for Rick, I had serious doubts he would ever do live acting ever again. I'm really happy he's back."
66,Honey I shrunk the great grandkids
67,"Cool that he came back for this film,However, Rick, My man, PLESSE accept Mel's offer for Spaceballs 3:The Search for Spaceball 2:The Search for more money before he dies.

We need that film more then ever!

Also a Doug and Bob Reunion would be nice too"
68,"No one can resist Disney's urge to produce a sequel. Not even Moranis.

Hope he gets good money tho, he deserves it. Seems like a good person."
69,I'm still waiting for that SCTV documentary that was filmed like 2 years ago with Scorsese.
70,"Hollywood is running out ideas. (let Jordan Peele, Rian Johnson and Christopher Nolan do whatever they want)"
71,I can't be the only one dreading this. Leave Rick Moranis alone!
72,"Note: this is not for a Disney+ series, but instead will be a theatrical film that will most certainly stream on Disney+ eventually."
73,Nostalgia and late sequels are slowly ruining all franchises...
74,I'm really surprised that this will be for theatrical release and not just a Disney+ movie. Very excited for this.
75,More fucking sequels. Fuck of Disney. You're running Cinema.
76,Let the Moranissance begin!
77,Righteous
78,"We had the Joe Pescinaissance recently, time for a new one."
79,I'm always ready for moreanus
80,"Disney has deeper pockets than Sony.

but more seriously though, maybe this role is more significant. I'd bet the Ghostbusters role would have been a tiny cameo."
81,It could just be that he had more fun with the Shrunk series? I imagine he‚Äôs wealthy enough that he doesn‚Äôt have to to anything unless he wants to.
82,"I thought the same thing, it could not have been the money bc I‚Äôm sure ghostbusters was willing to offer him gobs of money. Maybe, I‚Äôm just speculating, his kids are a little more grown now? He feels comfortable to be able to commit his time. In any case he‚Äôs a great guy and a role model."
83,"This is a more iconic role for him, in the sense that he wasn‚Äôt supporting a handful of other comedy all-stars like he was in Ghostbusters. If he‚Äôs gonna come back, this makes most sense."
84,He retired in 1997 to take care of his kids so they're probably near 30 now.
85,"> Josh Gad

I don't now how I feel about this"
86,"Cash them checks, Rick."
87,I feel like that kind of family movie in theaters doesn't really exist anymore. Once kids are past animated films they go to superhero movies. There's no in between
88,Reganomics!
89,Can't leave out the Matthew McConaughaissance.
90,who else deserves an aissance^? ?
91,Aw hell do we need to worry about grandkids?! Is a Louis Tully: Keymaster movie never gonna happen??
92,"He was pretty hilarious in *Little Monsters* last year but yeah the rest of his output is uhhhh, a mixed bag."
93,I feel great. He was amazing in book of Mormon.
94,I think he's sort of like Kevin Hart in that he's pretty funny when he doesn't have to carry a movie by himself
95,Way too much hate for that guy on this sub.
96,"Josh Gad always surprises me with how naturally hilarious he is tbh, I'll be excited to see what he does with the role. If you've never seen his Wired interview with Jonathon Groff I recommend it, the dude is a riot."
97,He was great in Wedding Ringer and Pixels
98,I completely agree. My first thought was how excited I am going to be to take my kids to see this.
99,Brendan Fraser. I'd also like to Johnny Depp get some redempsh
100,Kevin Spacey. Free the Space
101,[deleted]
102,I‚Äôm enjoying him in Avenue 5 on HBO
103,"He was fucking hilarious in Little Monsters, every time he was on screen I was cracking up.



A very fun film overall."
104,"I feel like he's very often let down by bad scripts or bad directing, he always goes hard in his acting.

I like him."
105,I do like his work in his supporting roles
106,But those are the same people.
107,Braff is on some drama show my wife watches.
108,Yup
109,Why only Americans suffer this problem?
110,"I prefer subtitles, because even though i can't understand what they're saying, you lose the actors emotional performance when its overdubbed."
111,"I normally avoid subtitles, but I did watch and really enjoyed Parasite and City of God. 

The main reason being that there are already plenty of English movies I still want/need to see, but I don‚Äôt immediately say no to subtitles if a movie comes up that seems interesting."
112,###TOP 10 GREATEST ANIME DEBATES OF ALL TIME
113,"If subtitles are too much of a hassle to enjoy a film, you are lazy. I cannot believe that the viewer is stupid because it is not difficult to read. It has to be pure laziness."
114,"Only certain movies.  Anime I prefer dubbed, Asian action only sometimes but dramas I can deal with.  The real barrier is the genre."
115,"I don't mind subs at all. However, I have to have seen the movie a few times in order to not miss anything. If I'm reading subs, it's hard to concentrate on what's happening in the movie.

I have the same problem when reading a book. Everything starts to kinda blur together in my mind and I have to read paragraphs 2 or 3 times to understand what's happening. A couple pages later and my mind wanders. Give me an audio book and I LOVE it though. I'll get hooked on a book to the point I just want to sit on the couch or lie in bed and listen."
116,"As a high school teacher, I can tell you, many of my students, if not most of my students, cannot read well enough and fast enough to watch a movie with subtitles."
117,*After Obamas Win Is Racism Still A Problem for Americans?*
118,"Yes, and they always will be. This is not going to make any difference. Sadly. It's similar with music."
119,"Yes, most Americans didn't see Parasite."
120,"Because if you live in a state like Ohio, you'd need to drive like 15 hours to get to a place where they don't speak English. There are so many different languages in a place like Europe that you're used to things being in other languages"
121,"I'm exactly the opposite, probably because I'm a slightly slow reader.  If I'm spending most of my time reading the subtitles, I'm missing out on the actors' physical portrayal/body language.  I'd rather have decent dubs than subtitles.  I will say that bad dubs can ruin it though, too."
122,"Some people have learning disabilities, vision impairments, or are just slow readers.  Just because subtitles aren't a problem for you doesn't mean there's no way they could be for others."
123,I live in Ohio... you don't have to go very far to hear other languages lol. I'm guessing you've never been to Columbus?
124,"WTF are you talking about, each country have their own language, its not like all people talk 5 different languages in 1 country.  
If you go to another country, then yes, there is another language."
125,I meant a place where the majority of people speak other another language to the point where they would be producing movies/TV with subtitles. Obviously people all over the US speak other languages but that isn't what I meant in regard to the point about subtitles.
126,It's much harder to go to another country in America than it is in most European countries. Although I don't doubt countries like Australia and Canada have similar issues.
127,I mean if you live in Spain it's pretty easy to drive to France for a weekend or something. You can't really do that in the US
128,"I think their point is that America is such a large place that is very prohibitive for a lot of citizens to ever leave the country and have a reason to be exposed to a different language.  Sure, Spanish is probably pretty prevalent in the south west, but that still leaves a lot of the country that doesn't have that exposure.

However, in Europe for example, they go between different countries with different languages much like we go state to state over here, because they are much smaller and in closer proximity."
129,"The problem with that kind of post is that you can‚Äôt recommend something as ‚Äúa film with a twist‚Äù without ruining the experience of the twist.

The best twist is the one you didn‚Äôt expect."
130,I don't know if i can call it a twist. But watch knives out. Parasite has a brilliant turn.
131,"Try memento, 7 deadly sins, and the usual suspects. Great twists on these films."
132,Maybe Pimer or The box.
133,Juwanna Mann
134,Grease has a fair amount of twisting.
135,"There are a lot of great movies that fit the description you're looking for, and I'm sure you'll get some excellent suggestions here. I just want to caution using this method to find such movies, since knowing that a movie has a twist ending is a spoiler of its own. The best twists are the ones you never see coming. And even if you don't guess the right twist, just knowing that one is coming can dampen the effect."
136,The Prodigy
137,"Moon, Gozu imo"
138,"The Game

Shattered

Dead Again"
139,Predestination (2014) has the most absurdly ridiculous twist I‚Äôve seen.
140,[Triangle (2009)](http://manapop.com/film/triangle-2009-review/)
141,"No Way Out with Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman, Sean Young, and Will Patton. It's up there with Usual Suspects for a whiplash inducing ending."
142,I like how they break the fourth wall at the end of Holy Grail.
143,Try White Chicks. A twist you‚Äôd never expect
144,Serendipity
145,"Less twist-ending and more just mindfuck, but both of Shane Carruth's movies, *Primer* and *Upstream Color*, are great. And also very different."
146,Mr baseball?
147,Bad news bears go to Japan?
148,"Could it be Gung Ho? Michael Keaton comedy about an American car company taken over by a Japanese company, and the big culture clash.  Pretty good."
149,"\*\*\*\*I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A BASEBALL THEMED MOVIE\*\*\*\*  


This was a side scene that is in a movie. Think 80's style Molly Ringwald movies."
150,"I don't know. Its not trivia, I'm trying to find an answer. Was Mr. Baseball from the 80's?"
151,The spy who dumped me.
152,There's that guy in 30 rock
153,"I met one of those twits in the Haight.  Boy, was he out of his element."
154,"Just watched last week if it's not this idk of any others.

(Edit: p.s. it is available on Amazon.)"
155,The officemates and myself thank you!
156,"You know, I went to college in Boston. Well, not in Boston, but nearby. No, not Tufts."
157,You have been told to shut up.
158,"This was the 1993 version starring Thomas Kretschmann, really good movie."
159,I agree. I thought he captured the german perspective of the battle really well.
160,"My suggestion is to watch his movies in order of release. So start with '**Bottle Rocket**' and eventually make your way to '**Isle of Dogs**'.

The reason why I suggest this is so that you can literally see him evolve as a filmmaker and see his style progressively get more refined.

It makes you appreciate how far he's come from his early days, to now."
161,Yes have drinks or snacks and strap in
162,"Nah don‚Äôt overthink it. Watch it in the order they were released if you want, or backwards, or random. Doesn‚Äôt matter. All the stories are separate, no connections other than using a lot of the same actors (Bill Murray being the most prominent). Just realize his first film, Bottle Rocket, is the least like his familiar style, though still a great film in my opinion (and featuring a very young Luke and Owen Wilson). Just don‚Äôt be turned off by it is all I‚Äôm saying. His second film, Rushmore, jumps right into that style and he never turns back. And don‚Äôt forget to watch some of his short films/commercials, they are pretty entertaining."
163,"I think that there isn't really an answer to your question. If you were to ask Anderson he'd say it's just a story and hopes you enjoy it.

He has a unique aesthetic that you either enjoy or don't. Not all of his movie's are as intense with that aesthetic. Most feel like storybooks, in fact a few of them are stories within stories. I'm not sure there's a watching order as they aren't connected. They get bigger as he goes really and each one implements something new. I would say that the French Dispatch seems closer in concept to The Grand Budapest Hotel more so than his other works."
164,"Sit symmetrically centered in front of the TV. 

 No but in all seriousness, just watch them and enjoy. No tricks or tips needed. The distinctive cinematography and production design will make themselves evident. 

If you want to watch the natural progression of his style, I suggest staring from the beginning of his filmography but you don‚Äôt really have to."
165,"Ohhhh. I‚Äôm a serious fan of his films. My space in my home has a lot of posters from his films and fan art and those funko vinyl figures. I‚Äôm currently working on framing more posters. 
The book about his films is hugely informative and gives a lot of information about inspirations for the films and the painstaking work of the intricate sets. 

What he is famous for is shooting in symmetry,
tracking shots. If you watch even clips from his films you‚Äôll quickly catch onto this. 

Beautiful color palettes are another of his famous ‚Äútrademarks.‚Äù Each film has a color theme to them. 

He has recurring actors on his films as well. Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and a few others are regular players in his films. 

What I love about his films in addition to the absolute eye candy and wonderful acting is that the stories have layers. Each character has their own story that comes together to create the whole film. They can be quirky and silly with a love story or a sad story. 

Wes is wildly creative and skilled. While it angers a lot of his fans that he‚Äôs not won an Oscar, I personally feel that‚Äôs ok. His films aren‚Äôt mainstream and that‚Äôs alright. 
I‚Äôd suggest you watch ‚ÄúLife Aquatic‚Äù and ‚Äú Moonrise Kingdom‚Äù. Those have been wildly popular and I think more obvious comedy. 

I could talk about his films all day lol"
166,Take mushrooms
167,"No need to watch Bottle Rocket. If you want to start with a good beginning, Rushmore is good. But Wes wasn't completely filled out until Tenenbaums."
168,"Yeah get stoned before watching it. You‚Äôll really appreciate the vibrant colors and creative cinematography. Wes Anderson is a wonderful director and his films are very pleasant to watch, especially after a bowl. Enjoy the movie, Hope this helps!"
169,But her mom was also more concerned with being the cool mom rather than giving her daughter some direction. And a drug addict trying to get better is still a drug addict. They weren't good parents.
170,"You seem to be projecting a lot here about 'victimization'. You're forgetting that she was a child, had no father figure and had a mother that was more concerned with being a cool friend than a real parent and brought drug addicts around her children. Teenagers without solid family foundations lash out, it just happens.

If you have a hard time sympathizing then I think that says more about you particularly then it does the movie. Characters don't have to be perfect or blame free to be sympathizable, especially when they're children from broken homes. Almost seems like you have personal experience with someone like this and maybe that's causing it."
171,My first thought is either Jennifer Lawrence or River Phoenix.
172,Evangeline Lilly maybe?
173,River Phoenix died in 1993... but it looks a lot like him.
174,Maybe Jennifer Lawrence
175,Kate Beckinsale frequently puts her hair behind one ear like that.
176,That chick from Star Wars.
177,>River Phoenix - that was my first thought.
178,What do you think happened? That's exactly the point.
179,"He later murdered an unarmed woman and two kids. And the unarmed cartel boss. As well as several unarmed cartel stooges. He also let someone almost get strangled to death. And threatened to kill her outright if she talked too much

Raping the prisoner is absolutely not outside of his normal operating parameters"
180,Showed him Cats
181,I thought he used the water container to crush his balls
182,"I have no idea that's why I was asking. It sounded like rape but I can't imagine that the character Alejandro would have done this. That's too weird. 

I thought the director would have revealed it maybe."
183,"That was because he seeked revenge. The cartel boss has killed his family.   
I could imagine him raping him with an object but nothing else.

And what did he bring the 20 l water bottle for? To distact the other agents so they would think he would ""just"" torture him with water (which would be totally ok) but not with his penis (because that would be a human rights violation)?"
184,"Cartel boss and unarmed doesn't matter, the boss usually tell the stooges who to kill. Rarely do they themselves partake in it to claim innocence if the stooge is caught"
185,"No, he haven't. But the goal was to make us imagine the horrible things."
186,Sometimes a director films it like that on purpose so the viewer uses his imagination to picture the horrible things being done. It can be a very effective technique.
187,"Psychologically, the prisoner was freaking out about being water-boarded. That's an extremely tough torture to suffer through. Then, last minute, he puts the water down and your mind just 'breaks' trying to figure out what could be worse than being waterboarded, something that's about to happen in a minute or two.

Psychological torture, turned up to 11"
188,"I get that. 

It just goes to show how resolute and cold he is- it's one thing shooting a guy in the face as he reaches for his gun. It's completely different to shoot his 6 year old daughter, 5 year old son and his unarmed wife just to see him break right before you pop him in the head"
189,"TLDR: ~~Th4r is in reshoots~~ he has no current plans for a Star Wars movie

Edit: Taika is not opposed to reshoots and uses them on all of his movies"
190,MCU movies all have reshoots in their schedules incase they need something after principal photography has finished.
191,Strange how Thor 4 is already in reshoots when it hadn‚Äôt even entered principal photography
192,"He was talking about Thor Ragnarok, Th4r hasn't even begun shooting yet"
193,"> Th4r is in reshoots 

No its not. It hasnt even been written."
194,And wasn‚Äôt just recently that they hired a writer?
195,"Ah thanks, I misread that"
196,Taika had written a script and a few days ago they hired some else to screenwrite too
197,"I love The Lost Boys ost. It's so 80's, I just can't cope with how amazing it is."
198,"Social Network, Moonlight, Her, Hans Zimmer‚Äôs Dark Phoenix

212,Frozen II. I cant stop.
213,"Inception, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.  Outside of way too many John Williams scores I listen to these all time.  The later I used to listen to when I was mourning. I can‚Äôt remember how many times I listened to On Thin Ice during that period."
214,Swiss army man
215,"I listen to the Broadchurch soundtrack and gloomy breezy days.


I listen to the Sunshine soundtrack when waiting at the Starbucks drive thru. Makes the build up to getting my coffee seem more grand."
216,"All of Star Wars, for the fun of it. John Williams music really is a treasure. And for that matter, John Powell did some very dynamic work, and while not impressive Michael Giacchino was solid on RO."
217,One of the best soundtracks ever
218,Probably an unpopular opinion but Tarantino‚Äôs movies have went downhill without Sally‚Äôs editing.
219,lots of people say that
220,Editing is so often  overlooked as to just how important it is. There are so many movies that with a different editor would simply not have been anything like what they were. I think you correct in your assertion as well. She had an amazing ability.
221,"Dude, everyone says that."
222,"I would definitely agree with that, although Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is the first Tarantino movie I thoroughly enjoyed since Inglourious Basterds. I thought Django Unchained and Hateful Eight were just too overlong and indulgent. OUATIH is somewhat overlong and indulgent in its own way, but I feel like that kind of suits the story because it's about people trying to hold onto the romanticized idea of Hollywood as long as they can before it goes away. There are scenes that definitely feel like they could be cut out or trimmed down to pick up the pace, but there were never any scenes where I felt like I was waiting for them to ""just get on with it"" like I felt when I watched Django Unchained and Hateful Eight. Those movies were more about plot, so it was frustrating to feel like the pace had been bogged down with unnecessarily long, drawn-out scenes. But OUATIH seems less interested in the plot, and more interested in being a snapshot of a time and place, with more emphasis on how the characters fit into that setting."
223,I like this trend of adapting podcasts into movies.
224,I stop and watch about an hour of *O Brother Where Art Thou* nearly every time I see it on TV.
225,"Aliens, Hot Fuzz, any Tarantino film."
226,"Just because I'm such a sucker for them, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I watch it probably once every year or six months. But outside of that, I would have to give it to Mad Max: Fury Road. Not particularly amazing to a lot of people but the movie is just so much fun."
227,The Social Network. Watch it every 4/6 months
228,"Sideways

O Brother Where Art Thou?

229,I never get tired of Kung Fu Hustle

237,"I've been rewatching Moana, Captain Marvel, Thor: Ragnarok, and Black Panther a lot the past several months. I've watched The Emperor's New Groove probably a hundred times. Back when I still had cable and no streaming services I'd drop whatever I was watching if I saw Winter Soldier on FX.

I guess I'm Disney's bitch."
238,Edge of Tomorrow. I just love everything about that movie.
239,"Her, Apocalypse Now, Meet the Parents, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, LOTR Extended Edition"
240,"Anchorman, but i burnt out after watching it a million times in 7 years"
241,Edgar Wright‚Äôs filmography. There‚Äôs always new stuff I pick up.
242,The dark Knight. I have watched it once a week for 1 year. I just can't stop watching it.
243,"Pre-Disney Star Wars, The Godfather, The Dark Knight and any Tarantino."
244,"The Big Short, Kingdom of Heaven and Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

Last Samurai is a great choice too, props OP."
245,I have seen Kill Bill 1 and 2 more than any movie.  Second place is Dredd.
246,"Skyfall, Gone In 60 Seconds (2000).

&#x200B;

When Skyfall was on Netflix I had it on in the background almost all day and never got tired of it."
247,"For me movies ive rewatched the most over the years include casino, goodfellas, heat, die hard, terminator 2, halloween (1978), pulp fiction, saving private ryan, the matrix and superbad"
248,One of the movies that I can watch over and over again is the original ghostbusters movie. I find it so funny. It‚Äôs one that I can quote the whole thing.
249,"It would be a comedy, for years I put them on as I went to bed. My go to's were old WC Fields or Marx Bros movies - settling down for the night with an old friend and a chuckle was nice, I felt like I noticed another gem comedy bit every rewatch.


It was *such* a big deal when their films were finally released on DVD (with old movies it seemed like there was always a couple decades or so worth of squabbles over film rights that had to be decided before they were released) and I didn't have to throw in an old VHS tape of The Bank Dick or Monkey Business..that usually featured a lovely, but well worn, introduction from Tom Hatten on his wonderful Family Film Festival show."
250,"I feel like some girly trash needs to be added, so i nominate Pretty Woman, The Devil Wears Prada, and Mamma Mia (I saw that crap 3 times in the cinema, and countless times on the DVD). Good rom-coms with brilliant actors are underrated."
251,"I think I‚Äôve watched Takahata‚Äôs ‚ÄúOnly yesterday‚Äù at least 15 times in the last 4/5 years, so I‚Äôd go with that

Another movie I‚Äôve been rewatching a lot lately is Jeffrey Lau‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Chinese odyssey‚Äù, it‚Äôs quite long (it‚Äôs divided in 2parts, 3 hours in total), but i love it

Finally Swordsman 1&2, I‚Äôve discovered them just a couple of years ago (they were unavailable where I live), but since then I‚Äôve been rewatching them at least once every 2/3 months"
252,J.J. Star Wars. Love the fast pace.
253,"Dazed and Confused. I didn't grow up in the 70s, but there's something about that movie that immerses me. Highly recommend the Criterion Blu-ray if you like collecting those."
254,"Interstellar or Blade Runner 2049. Watched both of them probably 50 times each, and Interstellar was about 7 times in Theaters."
255,"Thief (1981),

Margin Call (really can't tell you what makes this so rewatchable),

Carlito's Way,

The Yakuza (1974),

Drive"
256,"Oceans Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen - easy every couple of months for me."
257,"Jurassic Park or Jaws. I've seen them both so many times and I enjoy it every time. Definitely worth buying on Blu-ray/4K.

Edit: also 2001 a space odyssey. I think that's the only movie that actually gets better every time you watch it."
258,"2001: A Space Odyssey

My Fair Lady

Kill Bill"
259,My guilty pleasure is Thor: Ragnarok. I can watch it almost weekly. Or Spider-Man:into the spiderverse. Im not even a big marvel person but the self awareness and irreverence both movies offer makes them stay fresh and absurd every time. Like. Whoever is in them is enjoying it as much as me it seems.
260,Brendan Fraser‚Äôs The Mummy!
261,"Good Time, Collateral, In Bruges, After Hours, Inside Llewyn Davis, Truman Show, Whiplash. Basically films that don‚Äôt have a central plot and constantly changes throughout. These films won‚Äôt necessarily rank in my top films of all time but they have a bit of everything and are just a joy to watch."
262,I rewatch There Will Be Blood every other month.
263,Everything I know about wine I learned from Sideways.  Great movie!
264,"I watch with chinese voices and subtitles but yeah, this scene gets me every time lol 

https://youtu.be/oCQDycs2G3o

Great film."
265,The Dark Knight is my favorite of the trilogy. Such a great film. Has my favorite joker too.
266,"I feel like generally holiday movies get overlooked often for these types of questions. When I saw the question my mind went to movies I‚Äôve seen many times like Superbad, but I keep forgetting that every holiday I‚Äôll watch Elf, Home alone, or some other Christmas movie. Add that up over many years and it ends up being watched more than many other films."
267,Nice. I watch The Matrix trilogy every now and again. I‚Äôm looking forward to buying it eventually in 4k resolution.
268,Solid choices
269,What are your favorite MCU films?
270,Thank you. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is one my favorite comedies.
271,Kill Bill 1 & 2 are awesome. Dredd is one of my favorite movies. So fuc***** good. I‚Äôve seen that many times as well.
272,Guessing you have a secondary viewing device for The Office?
273,"Love Devil Wears Prada, and I feel your list needs Mean Girls. I can practically quote the entire movie."
274,I also love that movie
275,Fury Road made the Road Warrior obsolete.Which i hate because i love the Road Warrior. But everything it did Fury Road did bigger and better
276,"I can't think of anything specific examples, but its probably movies that come from the middle tier of the genre.

Generally I find if you watch the first examples, their often better (or at least different) compared to what the genre became, simply cause the one's that came later often only incorporated and built upon the most obvious elements.

Say for example the original Godzilla is a beautiful and still shocking to this day story of a powerful modern nation feeling helpless in the face of a seeming unstoppable disaster that is partially their own creation.

Meanwhile later one's are just epic giant monster movies, where the plot can get a bit predictable."
277,"I don't think you can really compare the Bourne & Wick movies.

But Spectre was a flat out downgrade from MI: Rogue Nation."
278,"This one took me awhile to come to terms with but 

Old School/Animal House

Edit:
I mean Old school is better than animal house"
279,Wow.  Strongly disagree.  They‚Äôre not really comparable either.  Like at all.
280,Agreed. The Bourne movies have decent story but boring action.
281,"I'm going to be downvoted for this, but I think *Enter the Dragon* (1973) feels mighty aged, considering all the other martial arts movies that have topped it in terms of choreography, stunts, etc. Sure, Bruce Lee may have been first (for the most part) and been the best overall martial artist to hit the big screen, but give me the likes of *Police Story* (1985) any day."
282,The Empire Strikes Back
283,"Bigger, yes, but I still prefer Road Warrior. Not that Fury Road isn't excellent; Road Warrior is just that good."
284,"Yeah, which is why I still enjoy the 1st Mission: Impossible and The Bourne Identity. The sequels are great (maybe except M:i-2 and Bourne 4) but they felt more formulaic and each installment just seemed bigger and louder than the previous one (though that's not necessarily a bad thing)."
285,Agree 100% on the Bourne movies. Wick isnt the same type of action flick.
286,Spectre was a downgrade even from the preceeding Bond films.
287,Why? I don't know much about those movies. Did better comedies come out after them?
288,"I had grown up knowing Animal House was one of the funniest movies ever, and never got around to seeing it. Finally did in college and laughed maybe once the entire movie. Mind you, I'm a big fan of John Belushi with Blues Brothers being one of my all time favorite comedies. And just that generation of SNL is fantastic to me. Animal House however just felt very dated. I'll rewatch  movies like Blues Brothers, Ghostbusters, Vacation, Caddyshack, Stripes, etc until the day I die. Probably will never watch Animal House again.

Hell though, even Vacation is pretty dated too. But I find a novelty in that movie given that it spawned a series and (for better or worse) it has a lot of memorable scenes and lines."
289,"They're action movies, why are they not comparable? It's not like I'm comparing Marriage Story to Fast & Furious or some kind of oddball comparison like that."
290,"I remember reviews at the time praised the action and camera work. Like, I get that it takes a certain skill to deliver shaky-cam in an *effective* way, and not just do it for the sake of looking cool. It's what separates the Bourne sequels from the Taken sequels. Shaky does not have to also mean choppy. I think film makers saw that and just shook the camera around during fight scenes and didn't realize that the way Greengrass did it was through the choreography of the fight, timing of hits, and editing it carefully to make it feel like you were the one either in combat, running, or driving away from something.

But at the end of the day, it's still a style I'd prefer not to see. I enjoy action movies more when I see exactly what's happening. Though, with Bourne it was still effective at least in the sense of his character. Everything feels jumbled and confusing because that's exactly how his character feels throughout the series."
291,Huh. This continues to be the best movie in the entire franchise.
292,"No. I mean that Old School is better than Animal House. Just in general as a college frat movie. 

I mean animal house paves the way and is still hilarious. Its just... Oof.  Idk i watched it recently and old school just makes me laugh harder (now)."
293,"Bourne Trilogy is more than an action movie.  It‚Äôs an action thriller with spy/mystery elements.  You could compare these films to say The Bond franchise or perhaps the Mission Impossible franchise.  Though both of those rely more on action than plot.  The Bourne movies are a bit more sophisticated in plot and character.  

It‚Äôs not easy to compare any action movie to another.  I wouldn‚Äôt be able to compare The Matrix to Jurassic Park."
294,There was never a point where it was.
295,What's the best for you?
296,Star Wars.
297,The first one?
298,They are going to be very true to the original. It will be a side scroller.
299,"[Mortal Kombat Reboot Wraps](https://movieweb.com/mortal-kombat-2020-wraps-production/)


‚ÄúSimon McQuoid was brought on to direct the Mortal Kombat reboot and is making his feature-length debut. The cast includes Joe Taslim (Sub-Zero), Hiroyuki Sanada (Scorpion), Chin Han (Shang Tsung), Ludi Lin (Liu Kang), Jessica McNamee (Sonya Blade), Josh Lawson (Kano), Tadanobu Asano (Raiden), Mehcad Brooks (Jax), Sisi Stringer (Mileena), and Lewis Tan in the mysterious lead role. As for what the movie will be about, that is being kept under wraps for the time being‚Äù

The article also mentions James Wan producing. 

I‚Äôm not sure how much influence the new games will have plot wise, the two newest games involve a bunch of characters children, and the need to establish the main characters before getting to them. However, visual and tone will be more brutal like the games as its supposed to be rated R."
300,"The one being directed by James Wan, is supposed to be R -Rated"
301,It's not him but a new director called Simon McQuoid from a commercials background. James Wan is producing so I'm hopeful.
302,what a legend. and he seems like such a genuine guy too
303,"he needs to work with Scorsese again!

and its surprising he hasn‚Äôt been in any Tarantino yet"
304,based Dafoe
305,His best collaborations are definitely with Abel Ferrara and Paul Schrader.
306,What about Lars Von Trier?
307,"That was a very fascinating interview, but big oof on the end there - Willem Dafoe was not happy about that question. I wonder if that reporter kicks himself about that.

> **AVC**: Playing Vincent Van Gogh, the character was much younger than you were when you were playing the role. Did that factor into your characterization at all?
> 
> **WD**: I guess nobody gave you the bulletin, huh?
> 
> **AVC**: I guess not‚Äîwhat do you mean?  
> 
> **WD**: Ah, you didn‚Äôt get the memo! I think that thing about age is bullshit. Yeah, Van Gogh was 37 years old when he died, but he was not a young man, first of all. Mortality in the time he died was different, their 40 was our 75.
> 
> **AVC**: You know, that‚Äôs a great point.
> 
> **WD**: This was not a young man. And he had a lot of physical problems. He was an alcoholic, and he was pretty beat up. So I may be older than him by numbers, but I never gave age a single thought. Plus, you have to think about this: He was a man that really lived life. A 37-year-old man now is not having the same kind of experience.
> 
> I don‚Äôt know. I never gave a thought, and I found it piddly and beside the point when people would discuss that issue. Watch the movie‚Äînobody should be thinking about age. I think it‚Äôs a beautiful movie. And if you‚Äôre thinking about that, you‚Äôre a moron, what can I say? Not you personally, of course.
> 
> **AVC**: [Laughs.] I know, I know. I know what you mean.
> 
> **WD**: Whoever even started that idea lacks imagination."
308,When did he work with Jane Lynch???
309,Willem Dafriend.
310,"I remember him being on the Jim & Sam radio show. He was really laid back, charming, and funny. One great moment was the host saying in jest ""I've got this great idea for a script where an old white cop and a black cop become friends"" or something like that, playing on how overdone this sort of thing is. Without missing a beat Willem goes ""only if I can play the black cop"""
311,haha that‚Äôs great
312,"Check which of these are posted to r/MovieDetails and post the ones that aren't already there.  
  
Here's a search for Parasite: https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/search?q=parasite+2019&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on"
313,"About using real life news studios, I don‚Äôt know if others feel the same but I hate it so much.

It doesn‚Äôt bother me when it‚Äôs in a foreign film because I didn‚Äôt grow up with them but when it‚Äôs done in a French film, it feels jarring, too realistic to be in a movie. It takes me out of the experience as much as actually changing the channel would."
314,"I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, but it‚Äôs so much cheaper and more convenient for a film doing a news scene (which are effective and logical ways to drop exposition as that is their real life function). It would be prohibitively expensive to create a news set just to do a 20 second info dump."
315,"one of my biggest problems with the film was that it honestly almost seemed like a vanity project for bradley. the title is about gaga‚Äôs character and it was marketed as though she was the star of the movie yet bradley‚Äôs character was the one with the most screentime, character development, etc.

the character was also an extremely shitty person yet we were made to feel sympathy for him for some reason."
316,"I had so many problems with this movie.  Like the fact that it‚Äôs a story about a woman that has no other women in it.  Really, she has no female friends or family? Bradley Cooper‚Äôs character is such a hardcore drunk from the get-go. What does she see in him?  The second she gets famous, the movie becomes all about him. We barely touch on how fame affects her.  There‚Äôs no paparazzi, no body shaming: she never meets any fans.  They really missed every opportunity to explore fame in the 21st century. 

It‚Äôs just a really poorly thought-out film."
317,"Her every other line was ""ok?"""
318,"I really wanted to like the movie. The chemistry between them was good but something about the relationship progression seemed unbelievable. 

I hate the ending so much."
319,"I agree with you. I have a really hard time rewatching it. Especially the scene where Cooper embarasses himself on stage. I know relapses are realistic and dramatic, but I hate watching them on screen for some reason."
320,"I liked this a lot the first time through, but agree with a lot of what you said the more time passes. The pacing through the second half was really slow, and I think the film could have been more consistent if they trimmed it down a bit."
321,"It is easily the worst of all three versions. Judy Garland, Barbara Streisand, and.... Lady Gaga?"
322,"Yeah Ally definitely could have used more screen time and character development. I wonder if that was originally the plan but they cut back on it because they felt Lady Gaga didn't quite have the acting skills. Not saying she did a bad job but there were multiple scenes with her and Cooper where I was thinking ""ok one of these people is an actor acting and the other is a singer acting"""
323,"Wow good call, I didn't even think about the lack of female characters. As far as their relationship goes I think we're supposed to take it as ""love doesn't make sense""."
324,"You should watch the first version with Janet Gaynor, it opens with her leaving her family (Because they think she should remain at home and not follow her dreams of becoming an actress) and having a lovely conversation with her grandma, who supports her."
325,"I just want to pick your brain as to why Ally needs to have female friends? Like is that a requirement?  It's evident that her friends are the LGBTQ - Ramon and the drag queens from the bar she works in. In fact, it is made clear the only reason she can perform at the bar is because of said friendship (""I get to be part of the gay girls""). Believe it or not, some LGBT spaces foster that sense of community and its possible that it doesn't include straight women. As for Bradley being a drunk,  it's an open secret that stars struggle with addictions given their circumstances, that doesn't stop them from being seen as stars by commoners, people are starstruck because they have charisma, regardless of their faults, that's part of why they've got to where they are. Not sure how her infatuation is difficult to believe (and it's not like she doesn't condone his behaviour/tries to help him get out of it) and to me, it's better for Jackson to already have his issues because the previous films have made it seem as though his demise/drinking is because of the female star's rise which is so outdated. Sam Elliott reminds us of that when he says that no one but Jackson is the reason for what happens, he got himself there, not Ally, that would be unfair to her character.  As for your other grievances, I understand, the depth of Ally's fame is not explored. At the same time, the film is meant to be a personal love story. A lot of the time it's not about fame itself, but how fame affects their relationship and that's what we get to see and what we want to see. We know the public repercussions of fame and what it comes with, that's cliche. Instead, we get to look at mental illness, the friction of creative integrity on their couple, the career sacrifices of loving someone deeply. It seems more compelling than seeing lady gaga cry because twitter trolls called her fat."
326,"Yeah too many things happen too fast. Meets her, then what the next night he brings her on stage and they sing a duet then they have sex? Then months(?) later he goes on a bender and makes his way to an old friend's house and he proposes to her and they get married that night? Like I guess it's supposed to be that they are both just people and they don't always know the best thing to do and ""love doesn't make sense"" but the film definitely pushed it. And yeah, the ending I really didn't buy that Ally's manager was able to push Jack to the edge like that. And if they were trying to make what Jack did look ""chivalrous"" then that's pretty fucked."
327,"That was definitely one of the ""over the top"" parts for me. Why not just have Jackson follow her to the stage and fall down on the steps? That would have accomplished everything they needed for that plot point."
328,Yeah it could've been at least 15 minutes shorter.
329,"I feel like most romance movies are about two people falling in love that don‚Äôt immediately make sense. But those movies have to makes us understand the attraction, chemistry, and the connection that those two have. We buy Harold and Maude!  We buy Julia Roberts as a street sex worker and Richard Gere as a business mogul falling in love.  We buy Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray.  We buy it when a straight man and a gay man have sex in Kiss of the Spider Woman as a kind of affirmation of their special bond."
330,"Yes, I‚Äôve seen it. That‚Äôs a great example of how it‚Äôs been done well. And the Judy Garland version doesn‚Äôt give her a family, either, but she gets a whole song and dance about what it was like trying to make it in Hollywood since childhood. We really see everything though her perspective and we always understand what she is thinking."
331,"She needs to have female friends or family because almost all women on this planet do.  There's almost 4 billion of us.  If you're going to make a movie about a woman, our experiences and our relationships matter.  A Star Is Born was written by 3 men and it shows.  It‚Äôs so easy to just make the mother dead or gone rather than have to imagine how a relationship with a mother would affect the plot. The same is true of depictions of the LGBTQ community in mainstream films written by straight people. They are almost always portrayed as white, male, and have straight friends."
332,"I love that she is close enough with her father to live with him, but then she gets married in front of strangers.  How is she not conflicted about cutting her openly living parent out of her wedding.  How is her dad not hurt??"
333,"Ah, gotcha, you can never tell. It's so very strange how the supposed modern version focuses on Maine the most."
334,"Ryan Reynolds. He's essentially the same character whether he's Deadpool, Pikachu, or a talking snail."
335,Seth Rogen
336,Jason Bateman had a very long stretch of playing competent employees who just wanted to get their work done.

367,"He's also great in The Outsider, a new Stephen King adaptation he had a hand in producing on HBO."
368,He basically played an Australian alien in Captain Marvel.
369,"True, but he‚Äôs the same guy in 30 other movies."
370,"I disagree - Depp and HBC have the same scope of acting, that stems off from Tim Burton movies/Pirates (in Depp's case) and can be seen in other their works. For example in The Lone Ranger, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Fight Club or Harry Potter. Their variety of roles isn't that big, in my opinion. 

Even when HBC was playing Princess Margaret in The Crown that was seemingly a different role, she still had some of these HBC mannerisms that translated well to the type of roles she's usually getting, but it was jarring in her portrayal of Margaret.

Not denying they're good actors, but they do tend to get the same type of their roles - Edward Scissorhands/Jack Sparrow and Marla Singer/Bellatrix."
371,I've seen enough I'm not saying he's untalented but he gets typecast a lot.
372,"yup - and another example, Game Night, he plays a asshole, and not really the straight man. Its like he told his agent ""im done with that character"" lol"
373,"Depp roles that are not Burton/Pirates influenced: What's eating Gilbert Grape, Donnie Brasco, Benny and Joon, Public Enemies, Finding Neverland, Chocolat, Dead Man, Nick of Time, (all good movies by the way)

For Helena you shoud watch Howard's End, Hamlet, Burton and Taylor, The Sufragettes, The Wings of the Dove, The King's Speech

It's not that they don't have range. It's just that you only see a very limited type of movies."
374,"He really doesn‚Äôt though.  I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre referring to him in gangster films such as Goodfellas, Casino and The Irishman.  But that‚Äôs not really typecasting that‚Äôs an Italian American working with a long time collaborator (Scorsese) who‚Äôs also an Italian American; making films that are part of their culture and upbringing.  

Other non-gangster films would include:  Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy,  New York New York, Deer Hunter, The Mission, 1900, Midnight Run, Awakenings, Cape Fear, Silver Linings Playbook, etc...  

But I understand why you think this.  It‚Äôs been said for years.  I just don‚Äôt agree at all."
375,"I did not get this impression at all.



The brother played by Kyle Chandler is the asshole. Bateman is just some uber competitive nerd with an inferiority complex doing his standard meek/""over-my-head"" thing, IMO."

392,"This script, despite some cool ideas that I would've loved to see, would've likely been just as hated as ROTS."
393,Lol what is it with lightning lately
394,"Agreed. They were one throwaway line in TFA, and it was implied they were the students he led from Luke's temple. Just make them something for the comics/games, they really didn't need any screentime in the movie unless Disney were going to do something interesting with them."
395,"Not at all lol. I hate disney starwars but that script and the concept at was much better than what we got. Tbh, he should've directed the sequels."
396,"exactly, they were little more than just a blurb for supplementary media (comics, games, action figures) etc.  Much like the bounty hunters (except for Boba Fett) in Empire Strikes Back: they all appeared in one scene for less an 45 seconds.  Darth Vader tasked them with hunting down the Millennium Falcon but then Admiral Piett just walks up to Vader to say they just found them"
397,"Headline: ""FINAL KILL Trailer (2020) Billy Zane, Danny Trejo Action Movie HD""

Trailer: Dr. Drew Pinsky is in the movie, and he's billed third - above both Danny Trejo and Billy Zane."
398,I mean the extra footage didn't really change anything other than giving us more of the girl.. wish we had some more background on the roaming group and the hotel entity
399,"Am the only one who preferred the Theatrical Cut?

I love Doctor Sleep and saw it twice in theaters. I pre-ordered the Blu-Ray and was excited to see the Director‚Äôs Cut which I watched a few nights ago. Definitely prefer the original.

My issue wasn‚Äôt the length because those three hours absolutely flew by. I just didn‚Äôt like some of the new material and dialogue.

1. At the beginning, the addition in the DC of Violet‚Äôs mother looking for her after she‚Äôs presumably been killed by the True Knot felt like an anticlimactic way to end the scene compared to the TC

2. In the DC, when young Dan first goes into the bathroom at his house, the old woman is fully revealed from head to toe before he runs away, as opposed to the TC which just shows her hand starting to pull back the shower curtain. I prefer the ‚Äúless is more‚Äù approach, especially considering we get several other scenes of the old woman in the bathtub throughout the movie.

3. The addition of the scene of Abra‚Äôs parents witnessing the piano playing itself felt unnecessary when the spoons-on-the-ceiling scene gets the job done.

4. Didn‚Äôt care for the dialogue where Crow says something to Rose about her being the ‚ÄúQueen Bitch‚Äù. Felt a little cheesy to me.

5. Around the scene where Dan gets a chip at his AA meeting and gives a speech, the DC inserts a scene that walks us through the Gold Room at the Overlook Hotel before zooming in to a glass of whiskey at the bar. I understand what this represents, but I don‚Äôt like how it spoils the ‚Äúgrand reveal‚Äù of getting to see inside the Overlook Hotel at the very end of the film.

6. I didn‚Äôt like the addition of the scene between Abra‚Äôs dad and the Crow when Abra is being abducted. In the TC, the way it is presented is that we see Abra‚Äôs dad watching over Abra while she does her thing. Then at some point it cuts back to Abra and her dad is no longer there. Then the next time it cuts back to her, the Crow injects her. It‚Äôs shocking because you are wondering what happened to her dad. The next time it cuts back to the Crow carrying Abra out of the house, the camera zooms in on the dad‚Äôs dead body. Again, less is more to me. It was shocking because obviously the Crow killed him off screen. In the DC, he still kills him off screen, but we get a scene of the dad confronting Crow after he injects Abra. Just felt less interesting to me because the sequence of events was explicitly spelled out, as opposed to being more chaotic and shocking.

7. During Dan‚Äôs confrontation with Jack Torrence in the Gold Room near the end of the film, the DC version has Dan refer to him as ‚ÄúDad‚Äù more than once. I felt the TC was more effective in that they dance around the subject until Dan finally calls him ‚Äúdad‚Äù just once near the climax of their conversation.

8. Continuing on from my previous point, I felt that the weight of their confrontation in the scene at the bar in the DC is much less impactful. Instead of the scene ending after Jack smashes the glass away from Dan like in the TC, the DC continues their conversation in a new scene in the red bathroom from The Shining. It was cool to see that set reconstructed, but their conversation in the bathroom is much less intense. Considering that is their final scene together, I preferred how it ended on a much more intense note in the TC‚Äôs bar scene.

9. Overall, I‚Äôm not a fan of the addition of the Chapter text overlays.

Just a few things off the top of my head. The Director‚Äôs Cur isn‚Äôt bad by any means, I just vastly preferred the choices that were made in the Theatrical Cut."
400,I‚Äôm very skeptical about that. That movie was extraordinarily mediocre.
401,"If anything most of the new footage was of Danny than Abra. A whole character aspect of Wendy not being able to look at Danny was added and strengthen his character (and the ending) considerably. His low points at the beginning was lengthen, we see him with Charlie longer, and of course the Overlook bar scene was lengthen and even went to the iconic bathroom. Hell, Rose got more new stuff than Abra."
402,"I agree on wanting more footage of the True Knot as a group‚Äîthe Blu-ray‚Äôs making of hinted at more scenes with them. But we did get more scenes of how Crow and Rose‚Äôs dynamic worked, and more elaboration on their methods (background research, NSA contacts) and a new scene with Jack Torrance that further hinted at The Overlook wanting Abra and Rose over Dan.

More/extended scenes throughout made the whole film a different experience, in my opinion."
403,"in all my years of watching film, I've learned to never trust a director's cut, and will only watch if the universal opinion is that it's better (Blade Runner is the only example that comes to mind).

Donnie Darko, Apocalypse Now, Amadeus, Almost Famous

All great movies with director's cuts that completely destroy the pacing of the films."
404,"I could not disagree more, I thought it was one of the better films this year"
405,You‚Äôre one of the few people who I‚Äôve heard say that. It was a great movie for a lot of people.
406,"> extraordinarily mediocre

Exceptionally ordinary"
407,"I was really confused by all the praise for this film. Everything felt forced and cheesy. Rebecca Ferguson is great but I can only take her so seriously walking around in that hat. There were a few interesting moments, but most of the time I could feel Kubrick rolling around in his grave."
408,"I've only seen the Director's cut ( yesterday ) , knew very little about it bar it had middling reviews , haven't read the book or knew any of the plot , not heard of the True Knot and as result enjoyed it far more than expected.

Also wanted much more of the True Knot. Enjoyed the first 2/3rds whilst it kept up the creepyness and tension, but kind of lost interest towards the end as it went all out once the shooting started."
409,I've only seen the director's cut and thought it was pretty great. It's one of the few movies I've seen that makes 3 hours feel like no time at all.
410,I guess I was just disappointed by it. Ewan McGregor did a fine job but the whole thing failed to really grab me for some reason.
411,"It was better than the book courtesy of being able to tie back into the abandoned Overlook rather than a tepid confrontation at ""Roof O' The World."" It still has a pretty impotent True Knot and glosses over a lot of Danny's struggles or any realism in a man just up and taking off with a young girl (especially considering the changes made in the film)."
412,"I've heard nothing but positive about it. I've heard mention on podcasts and interviews. If you were interested in seeing it in a theatre I'd suggest you keep a watchlist on a site that keeps release dates for your area.  
  
I think it's on home media now or soon."
413,It did well and yes it's worth the watch. You can clearly see that shia really had fun doing this movie.
414,I heard about it from my aunt a few months ago who watched it and she recommended it to me. It got fantastic reviews and audiences loved it. It‚Äôs a great film that is perfectly entertaining with something to say! Watch it when you can it‚Äôs worth everyone‚Äôs time .
415,"it is a fantastic movie. Shia is amazing in it, as is the lead. Its a great, feel good movie"
416,Great film. Definitely the feel good film of the past year. One of Shia's best that further solidifies his dramatic chops. Would recommend
417,Great movie.
418,"‚ÄúFun‚Äù fact:

Shia‚Äôs arrest and subsequent rehab as portrayed in Honeyboy happened during the filming of the Peanut Butter Falcon."
419,"It was a great watch! Very wholesome and entertaining.

The leads presented at the Oscars together this week!"
420,"It's good, entertaining and rewatchable but there were too many good films last year for it to make my top list."
421,Sounds cool! I'll check it out for sure.
422,"The roommate was partially at fault. And yeah, stand up comics are notorious for being assholes to each other."
423,"no, not really. a24 just isn‚Äôt able to campaign as hard as other studios. add onto that it being an almost entirely foreign language film, and it being directed by a woman, i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if some voters skipped watching it"
424,"Probably not. A lot of these boutique distributors like A24 and Neon pool their resources around one film per awards season. In last year's case, A24's big push was for Uncut Gems."
425,They are completely different films. The fact they are set in Asian countries is literally the only thing they've in common. The Farewell had no chance because A24 somehow messed up with all their movies this year.
426,Is it your belief that it was overlooked because only one Asian film at a time can get attention?
427,A24 should have lobbied the Academy for The Farewell to compete for Best International Film. It qualifies because it's mostly in Chinese and could have taken the spot of Corpus Christi.
428,I didn't find it to be that particularly good of a movie.
429,"I saw an article saying that some voters didn‚Äôt watch it at all, along with Uncut Gems and Hustlers. So you‚Äôre right to say that."
430,"Well that push didn‚Äôt work apparently haha.

Someone in another thread said the guy who did most of the campaigning for a24 went to Netflix. Could be the reason they went from winning a best picture to basically getting no Oscar love."
431,"> I have a feeling that Academy Awards don't have many quota for Asian theme/cast movies.

certainly seems so"
432,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big leap to state that movies outside of traditional narratives don‚Äôt tend to do well at the Academy Awards. There‚Äôs a reason people are so surprised about Parasite.
433,"wow. i‚Äôm not happy to be right, but i‚Äôm not surprised. those three were absolutely snubbed"
434,"I totally agree, it‚Äôs a shame. A24 had a great year too and I was hoping for at least one. Hustlers was great as well and I think Lopez earned her nom. Oh well, maybe next year."
435,ask in r/tipofmytongue
436,Google found something called **Fly By Night** from 1992
437,Irreversible
438,"That's it.  Eye is listed as ""I"" which may be why I had trouble finding it. Thanks!!"
439,"I found it to be hilarious, as expected. Too bad it's such a short film but I guess it's for the best, though I would've loved to see more of that insanity."
440,"I'm one of maybe 14 people that liked ""Rubber"", I have to see this.  
Too bad I live in a cinematic wasteland."
441,"So this is the same guy behind Mr Oizo, Flat Beat has become such influential track for different genres."
442,I got tickets to see it at the Glasgow Film Festival in a couple of weeks.
443,Elf. We still watch Elf together at least once every December.

448,"A League Of Their Own is huge in my family.  We quote that movie damn near constantly.  Also, Christmas Vacation."

457,"Same, the easy ones to spot are Chapagetti and Neoguri."
458,I'm definitely sensing a theme of violence here. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
459,Bro-tastic!
460,"I had written my reply in Moviesuggestions but noticed that it was deleted so here it is. It's a really nice list with some really great movies! What could be noted is that it is somewhat focused on a select group of directors (4 tarantino's, 2 Nolans, 2 Scorseses, 1 by the Coen brothers and 1 Bong). There is nothing wrong with having more movies by the same director in your top 10 cause that particular director might just suit your taste.

My critique stems from the fact that I think watching movies is also about broadening your horizon. You might be pleasantly surprised by how a movie outside your normal pattern might surprise you. Judging by your top 10, I think Parasite might've been such an experience for you. If you like cinema and you want to know more, my advise is to go out and explore. This is not to say that a certain genre is less than another genre but to simply drink in all it has to offer. If you like *Django Unchained* and *The Hateful Eight*, why not watch some older movies by an Italian like Sergio Leone (1929-1989) or *[Brimstone (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci3OHOolzEk)* by the Dutch director Martin Koolhoven (1969), for example."
461,"Good list, all pretty well known to be very good films. Only film on there I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of is Django (but still liked)"
462,"If you haven‚Äôt seen Apocalypse Now, Old Boy, There Will Be Blood and Fight Club you would probably like them."
463,"Personally think The Thing belongs up in there somewhere, also True Romance but hey, to each their own"
464,epic
465,"I‚Äôd recommend watching more than one type of movies. Branch out. Watch different movies by different kinds of filmmakers. Don‚Äôt get stuck in the film bro bubble of Nolan and Tarantino and Scorsese and the Coen Brothers et al. Watch foreign films, watch films directed by women, watch slice of life indies, watch comedies. 

Limiting yourself to one quite narrow type of movie (even if you love blood and violence) will just make you miss out on a lot of great stuff. 

Parasite is a nice entry to Korean cinema, for instance. You could do The Host next, or Memories of Murder. Burning is one of my favorite recent movies from South Korea."
466,What do you mean by saying you don't have great taste?
467,Mr. Orange was a hero.
468,"The one thing that jumps out at me, other than the many obvious things, is that I‚Äôm surprised Scarface isn‚Äôt on there. 

This is very much the list of someone who has a Scarface poster in their bedroom."
469,"A nice and violent list, The Departed is a favourite of mine as well. Imo, it‚Äôs Scorsese‚Äôs best."
470,Basic/10
471,Pretty ho hum list of great movies. 3/10
472,Im noticing a trend.
473,"1. I‚Äôll get shit for it but pulp fiction is overrated imo. Didn‚Äôt really care for it. 

2. Good and original. However I hate this movie for spawning that ‚ÄúBRAGHHHHH‚Äù noise every movie feels they need to do now. 

3. Good

4. Haven‚Äôt seen

5. I do not understand the hype with this movie. I really did not like it. Maybe my expectations were too high? Idk but man I was really disappointed with this. 

6-9. haven‚Äôt seen

10. Didn‚Äôt really care for this one. 

I apparently do not enjoy anything lol"
474,"Why do you care what other think of your top 10? You love the movies you love and you're in no control of that. Cinema as any other art is 100% about personal preference and totally subjective so there is no ""better taste"". If people critisize you they're just plain stupid snobs. 

Your list is great! Lots of amazing films."
475,"Try watching some female directed movies, nothing wrong with the list but it might bring a different perspective. Try a Ladybird, atonement, other stuff along those lines."
476,"I've seen worse lists but having said that there is way too much Tarantino on here. I understand he is popular with teenage boys but try watching more movies from different genres, different decades and different countries."
477,"Good list but too much Tarantino, Nolan... I'd personnaly put n¬∞10 higher in the list.

Try to watch Classics, European and more Asian movies especially Korean and your Top 10 will look completely different."
478,"
>a theme of violence here

OP would enjoy *A History of Violence*"
479,If there was an AI that could predict who you were based of your movie preferences and it saw this list it would most likely guess that OP has a 99.5% chance of being male. Probably predict a high chance of being white and between 18-30.
480,"Thank you so much for constructive criticism. I have this weird system where I go by director which I know is not the best way to do it, but it calms me. My list is full of directos and I have a list of solo movies that include those by Sergio Leone, Seven Samurai, Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away etc.) and I can‚Äôt wait to see more foreign films. I‚Äôve been trying to broaden my horizons and step into dramas, rather than thrillers and crime movies, but I haven‚Äôt found many worth adding. I‚Äôm absolutely having great fun doing this."
481,"Have watched Fight Club, and it was up there for a while. Felt it was bested by No country for old men and Taxi Driver. All the rest are in my list. Thanks!"
482,Just started starting to watch movies seriously and I‚Äôll try to get there soon. The Handmaiden is also on my list for Korean movies. Thanks!
483,I can tell that for your username huh?
484,Still got to watch it. Pretty high expectations. Hope it lives up to them
485,Ever heard of Goodfellas?
486,It‚Äôs really good!
487,Parochial lummox this one.
488,Probably
489,Thanks!
490,"Love Tarantino, and naturally, lots of blood"
491,"In the end its opinions, I feel like most of these movies were helped by the hype I got before watching them, but you have your pics and I have min. I really recommend 4. It‚Äôs really good"
492,Will do! About Ladybird I have no idea what it‚Äôs about
493,"Or maybe even nightingale ,American honey or fish tank"
494,"As I‚Äôve said before, I‚Äôm trying to expand. But thanks for criticism."
495,Thanks!
496,Or Eastern Promises by the same director (Cronemberg) and with Mortensen again. God that bath scene was tough to watch
497,"I would stake my entire life on those numbers, good chance of being younger too"
498,"I'm glad to hear you liked it! I am still going mainly by director as well and I see nothing wrong with it.    I think the more arthouse movies will slowly grow onto you. You will get used to and understand the slower pace of these movies better and better, for example. 

I think a step in the direction of these kinds of movies that you will probably enjoy are 'In Order of Disappearance (2014)' by the Norwegian director Hans-Petter Moland (1955), 'There Will be Blood' (2007) by the American director Paul Thomas Anderson (1970) and 'Drive' by Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn (1970). Oh and don't forget the movies by the Irish directors John Michael McDonagh (1967) and Martin McDonagh (1967)"
499,I don't get it lol
500,"Don't worry about it, it's a very quick watch and offers a much different perspective from a Tarantino."
501,"Will do! Paul Thomas Anderson is on there because Magnolia, The Master, There will be blood and Boogie Nights"
502,Oh I said it cuz you username says Django. Mistake
503,"Yeah what I was trying to say was that, it's not like there are bad movies in the list so there's nothing wrong with your taste lol, it just seems like you like more this kind of films. You like them because of the genre or do you think you have favorite genres or do you like them because of their director and their style?"
504,Mix of all those really
505,"I see then I'd say to try to watch all their filmography and given that they are all pretty open about their favorites movies and what films inspired them try to see if you can watch those movies too, you can discover some interesting stuff. Especially Scorsese and Tarantino made a ton of list about their favorite movies. Also it seems like for genres you like westerns (Hateful Eight, Django), gangster movies (Pulp Fiction), psycological thriller (Taxi Driver, The Prestige). So for westerns checks out some classics like Leone's movies, he's one of the best director ever, Corbucci's The Great Silence, wonderful western set in the snow who ispired Tarantino's The Hateful Eights, Ford's The Searchers, Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and some more moderns westerns like Kim Jee Woon's The Good, The Bad, The Weird or Miike'a Sukiyaki Western Django (Tarantino does a cameo in this film). For gangster movie, apart from Scorsese's movies, I'd say checks out classics like Untouchables, Scarface, The Godfathers, Boyz in the hood, The Public Enemy and more modern movies like Bittersweet Life, Infernal Affairs, History of Violence, Animal Kingdom. For psycological thriller checks out Vertigo, Mullholand Drive, Seven, Oldboy, maybe Rosemary's Baby and Psycho (they are more horrors), El Secreto de sus ojos, Prisoners."
506,I think it was the Black Mirror episode ‚ÄòWhite Christmas‚Äô?
507,"It's definitely Black Mirror: White Christmas

Guy's girlfriend blocks him all of a sudden and then she has a kid. He spends the entire episode trying to find a way to make contact, believing the kid is his."
508,Krull
509,the sub to ask is r/tipofmytongue
510,"I think there was a similar sci fi movie but I am not sure, When I looked up White Christmas, I am wondering if thats the one. I maybe getting confused with a movie where Mickey Rourke being a wrestler getting ignored by his daughter no matter what he did.

So it has be black mirror white christmas lol thank you!"
511,Have you seen krull?
512,Yes.  Have you?
513,Yep. Is awesome
514,Darn tootin' it is.
515,"Couldn't find a star, ninja or otherwise, for first comment"
516,"I‚Äôm really excited about it because I heard that it talks about Alice Guy-Blach√©, the very first female director and yet pretty much forgotten.

She was in the room when the Lumi√®re brothers presented their invention, made some of the first films ever and even made what is believed to be the first film starring an all African American cast, rediscovered recently."
517,Directed by Mark Cousins.
518,There's nothing more unrealistic than a romcom. To the point these things don't really stand out.
519,Dialogue that would never happen in real life? I have that feeling with so many movies.
520,"I think calling it incel-y a bit too much but I think he writes what he knows from experience,  he probably sees or saw himself  as fat nerdy nice guy that ended up with a wife out of his league.  So what you think is unrealistic is actually reality in his world . I agree his dialogue is crap but he may really not know how to talk to women."
521,No
522,That they are not as bad as Chasing Amy.
523,Why would you want to watch a realistic movie?
524,"Oh yes, 100%. 

A lot of the creepy men I‚Äôve dealt with have had some type of similarity to a Kevin Smith character. Partly why I‚Äôve never liked his movies apart from Dogma. 

He‚Äôs the type of guy to randomly tell off a guy for not watching a movie with a female lead and automatically claiming their sexist before even asking them what they‚Äôre issue is. He‚Äôs that type of man, and that‚Äôs why he has always irritated me."
525,Well more like Male lesbian
526,"I was thinking that. That all rom coms are unrealistic. Usually they are targeting a female audience however. The Kevin Smith ones are just rom coms for men. So rather than it being sappy girl stuff its sappy guy stuff, which in a lot cases can come off very neckbeardy and ""virgin-y"". Not used to seeing a rom com made with the male audience in mind."
527,When keyboard warriors think too hard (not you OP)
528,That didn't stop him from getting married and having a kid.
529,"I don't know what's wrong with Chasing Amy in this context. What I took from that movie is that Amy has the right to be who she is and have a past without being judged or labeled for it, and that Holden is not much better than Banky in the end."
530,Chasing Amy was his best one imo. Even though that woman's voice kills me.
531,"They're sexist*

What their issue is*"
532,"Oh no, I'm not talking about the quality of the movie, I'm talking about the vibes."
533,Oh I‚Äôm sorry! English isn‚Äôt one of my first languages. Thank you!
534,"Hey, are you trying to communicate? Those aren't valid sentences."
535,Then honestly great job lol you know it more than I know any other language lol
536,Yeah the dialogue is very to the point.
537,holy shit are you me? I too have ADHD and can‚Äôt do subtitles. I‚Äôve said this out loud to pretty much every person who‚Äôs asked me if I‚Äôve seen it. Thanks for this post.
538,There's another of his movies that I really liked called Mother. It's also subtitled but I think you should check it out.
539,"I have ADHD and love movies as well, but I've often found subtitled movies even easier to focus on than non-subtitled. When I'm watching something in English, I find myself getting distracted by things around me (mostly my phone), but with subtitled films, the increased activity of having to constantly shift my focus from the subtitles to the action generally allows me to better keep track of the movie. Is that always true? No. And then I have to rewind. But a lot of the time anyway!"
540,"That's funny - because of my ADD, I actually turn the subtitles for shows and movies in English since it helps me focus on the dialog."
541,"Yeah that‚Äôs what I loved, the dialogue is amazing I was fully invested in every word, definitely deserving of the screenplay win"
542,"No problem, just thought I‚Äôd share a bit of my story with it so others who struggle with subtitles might not be as intimidated"
543,My dad who has adhd loves foreign films and says the exact same thing however my brother in law is like me who has a harder time focusing with subtitles
544,I'd also credit the acting. The cast did a great job expressing emotions and physically acting out their dialogue. I think Bong knew this movie would have international appeal and did a great job ensuring the movie could be enjoyed on a visceral level.
545,">This looks like the most Wes Anderson film ever.

Said about every Wes Anderson film ever."
546,Henry fucking Winkler in a Wes Anderson movie.
547,There's our next production design winner at the Oscars.
548,Is this a wes anderson film? I can't really tell
549,Gotta go sit in the exact middle of my room for this one
550,The scene of Chalamet and McDormand speaking while he‚Äôs in the bathtub...classic Wes Anderson
551,Nice to see Owen Wilson in a bigger role for once. Probably his first since The Darjeeling Limited.
552,Cast your votes as to whom the ‚ÄúGraphic Nudity‚Äù warning refers to. I‚Äôm leaning Chalamet because of the bathtub scene but Del Toro is a dark horse.
553,Wes Anderson. Black and white. Aspect ratio. Timotheeeeeee. France. JOURNALISM.
554,"Of all the Wes Anderson movies out there, this is the most recent"
555,"And Ebenezer Scrooge opened his window and saw a young boy and shouted, ""you there, what day is it?""

""Today? Why it's New Wes Anderson Trailer Day!""

And Tiny Tim did not die for he had something to live for."
556,I‚Äôd forgotten how much I love Owen Wilson in Wes Anderson‚Äôs movies
557,They might as well just engrave the Oscar for production design a year in advance to save time.
558,"There is something so relaxing about Wes Anderson's films. Most characters are extremely soft spoken, sounds are harmonious and uplifting and the cinematography, well its just a pleasure for the the eyes."
559,It's odd not seeing FOX above Searchlight anymore
560,"Yup... that's Wes Anderson alright...

Can't fucking wait."
561,"That cast is fantastic and I love the switches between black and white and color. Timoth√©e looks great and yeah, the ending got me.

Edit: What‚Äôs the song? Is it apart of the score I‚Äôm guessing?"
562,"The Oscars *just* happened, you're not supposed to deliver award contenders this early!"
563,"There's something that looks so amazing about this movie...it has all the Wes elements but stills feel fresh and more dynamic, I'm loving it"
564,"I don't know why, but that shot of Saorsie Ronan is really strikingly beautiful to me."
565,"If theres Saoirse, I will be watching"
566,Will Wes Anderson ever make a movie that I‚Äôm not excited about? Not today at least
567,The cast is fucking amazing and I think this going to be the most *Wes Anderson*est movie ever.
568,"Bernie the frontrunner, Strokes new single, new Wes Anderson trailer.

&#x200B;

Big week for straight white dudes who went to small liberal arts colleges ^(like myself)"
569,The black and white sequences look gorgeous and peak Wes. It‚Äôs like he heard everyone say he couldn‚Äôt make a Wes Anderson movie without pastel colors.
570,"Okay, that black and white shot of the person coming through the wall? That blocking is nuts. This movie looks so good!"
571,"Del Toro is someone I never expected would work well with Wes, but this trailer already proves that notion wrong. Very excited for this!"
572,Timmy is upping his unkempt hair game.
573,And the academy award for best cinematography goes to...
574,wes anderson you son of a bitch im in
575,"Honestly they should just cancel the Oscars next year and give him all the awards since he already cast the *entire* Hollywood.

PS: **Saoirse Ronan**"
576,Can it really be more Wes Anderson than [fake Wes Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfDIAZCwHQE)?
577,HOLY FUCKBALL SOUP WHAT A CAST INJECT THIS SHIT STRAIGHT INTO MY VEINS
578,*The Post: A Wes Anderson Film*
579,how does wes anderson seem to out-wes anderson himself in every film he makes?
580,If L√©a Seydoux and Timoth√©e Chalamet don‚Äôt speak French at some point during this film I‚Äôll be pretty upset
581,I can see that this will be a masterpiece
582,">I can see that

I envy Frances McDormand."
583,"Seems like this might be for Wes Anderson what *Buster Scruggs* was for the Coen Brothers. Speaking of which that's Mike Yanigata from *Fargo*! 

Looks good, Anderson's style can be a bit hit or miss for me but I usually find they get better with re-watches, especially the more 'grand' ones."
584,"The diagrammed sentence:
""They will fail to notice the torn ticket stub for an unclaimed hat which sits alone on the upper shelf of a cloakroom in a bus depot on the outskirts of the work-a-day town where were apprehended Nickerson and his accomplices."""
585,"Oh my god C√©cile de France is in this.

I haven‚Äôt seen her since Around the World in 80 Days."
586,Anyone actually know what this is about I‚Äôm lost
587,I thought Grand Budapest Hotel was perfect and yet this looks even better than that
588,Timothee and saoirse back at it...count me in
589,There's the Wes style I love. Can't wait for this one
590,Timoth√©e Chalamet will be giving Bob Dylan vibes for the entirety of 2020.
591,"All those cast names appear, and the frame - and my brain - explodes in sheer awesomeness. 

Wes is back and I can't wait."
592,I want this movie right now.
593,"Imagine a world where[ this is the ""oh, and also these people were there, too""](https://i.imgur.com/Dj75Lt1.png)

Seriously, that alone is star-studded."
594,This is like Wes Anderson distilled down to his essence.
595,This is just brilliant.
596,Timothee Chalamet is an actor high in demand.
597,"Wes Anderson watched that FBI home invasion gif and was like ""I can make a whole about this."""
598,Oooh chalamet and seydoux seems to be the couple in this movie. Lucky guy
599,Love me some Wes Anderson. Can‚Äôt wait
600,Once again just another absolutely stacked cast in a Wes Anderson movie
601,"It's like,  how much more Wes Anderson can you get? The answer is none, none more Wes Anderson."
602,Does anyone know the name of the last song they played?
603,Norton is the voice on the phone.
604,"Anybody know the french song midway through? Sounds like he's saying ""je crier"" and ""arrive"" repeatedly"
605,At what point is Wes Anderson going to become a parody of himself?
606,"Having just thumbed through every frame of Isle of Dogs and Grand Budapest Hotel to study set pieces, I very much welcome more material to pore over. Some styles of shots in the trailer I‚Äôve never seen in one of his films before (rear-mounted wheelchair cam), looking forward to it!"
607,What is the song at the end of the trailer?
608,The opening narration makes me feel like it's a sequel to Stranger than Fiction
609,"I sometimes feel pretentious saying ‚Äúoh I love Wes Anderson‚Äù because it seems a little like he‚Äôs the guy to love to FEEL smart if you know what I‚Äôm saying...

But man I love Wes Anderson. His movies are like illustrated books brought to life. Balance, composition, tone. Even if the colors give me headaches at times. And a few of them have that 45 minute in slowdown that I hate (just a personal opinion, a lot of my favorite movies have that and I love them anyway).

Most of all it‚Äôs nice to see someone making what they love."
610,this is exactly the same movie as Grand Budapest.... literally
611,I have watched this three times and I still have no idea what its about
612,"Well, i can confirm that i'm not a Wes Anderson guy"
613,"Dude can make something look pretty and clearly great actors want to work with him, but I just can't get into his movies. I don't know what it is."
614,"Multiple aspect ratios AND switches from colour to black and white??? 

How many dang notices are mainstream theatres gonna have to put up for this one?"
615,"Wes Anderson is the ""Johnny Depp character in any given Tim Burton movie"" of directors.

Not gonna see this flick. You see one Anderson film, you've seen them all."
616,Same old crap from this director.
617,"Wes Anderson movies are *fine*. You've seen one, you've seen them all. 

Sometimes I wish he would move out of his comfort zone and do something daring; but some directors lack that ambition, and it's probably for the best."
618,I like most of Wes Anderson‚Äôs films but I can never get excited for his next one since they all feel like the exact same thing.
619,"The shot of the camera spinning around the table is very un-Wes Anderson, but otherwise this looks like the most Wes Anderson-ist movie ever."
620,This looks like it‚Äôs all over the place
621,"Colour me (in a pastel pallet, of course) excited!"
622,"This looks amazing. Production design is off the charts. The cast is stacked.
I'll admit the reason I checked the trailer out is because of Timothee Chalamet and he looks amazing in this trailer but this looks so cool that I want to see all the other Wes Anderson movies ( I've only seen Budapest) ."
623,Looks like a visual feast. I‚Äôm in.
624,"Man what an insane cast, that might be the most combined talent I've ever seen in a single film."
625,This looks like if every Wes Anderson film had a 2 hour orgy on acid
626,it's like all of his previous movies had a child and then that child smoked a cigarette
627,"""I am a genre"" should be his bloody name!"
628,"The most Wes Anderson, Wes Anderson can be. Like each of his movies compressed into one."
629,It take 1.3 seconds to identify a movie as a Wes Anderson movie. You could probably write a computer program to do it.
630,Seems like another movie that no one will see yet will sit at 98% on rotten tomatoes forever
631,This was a little messy....
632,I love how it goes through the cast at the end and then just drops a card with like 20 amazing actors.
633,"It looks...fantastic

That preview, and this cup of darjeeling I'm currently nursing, has me so twitterpated I had to loosen my ascot."
634,Can't wait for this to come out so I can stop rewatching The Grand Budapest Hotel
635,Is Adrien Brody just doing the same character from GBH?
636,I can‚Äôt wait to see this! Timothee Chamelet is such a good Wes Anderson fit
637,"Ugh I feel like Wes Anderson is now just trying to Out-Wes-Anderson himself. You know what I‚Äôd like to see from him? Something totally different. Like a Nior crime drama that actually uses closeups and minimal set design. Or better yet, practical locations. I feel like he should have been theatre guy. I mean...I'll still see it."
638,Wes Anderson continues to out Wes Anderson himself.
639,"Im not much of a studied movie fan, but that was absolutely beautiful."
640,Why does every scene look like a baroque painting?
641,"What an epic cast! Amazing to see some of the actors on the final cast list that don't even make the cut of the trailer - Anjelica Huston, Liev Schreiber, Edward Norton, etc. Those are some huge stars to leave out of the advertising. And did Kate Winslet and Alex Lawther drop out? Or did they run out of space to feature/credit them?"
642,Holy shit......this CAST
643,Every time I see someone say this about an actual Wes Anderson movie it feels so redundant and unnecessary to me. Like it‚Äôs so Wes Anderson to make a Wes Anderson styled movie? Yeah it‚Äôs... Wes Anderson
644,Seeing that logo at the start without Fox on it looks ... weird.
645,To me Wes Anderson films always feel like I‚Äôm reading a picture book. Something that harkens back to childhood. Makes his stuff incredibly rewatchable.
646,Vignettes are smart for a cast like this. Trying to get this many famous people in the same place would be daunting. This is a much more Tarantino approach.
647,"Man I‚Äôm hyped. I wonder if he can outdo Grand Budapest, which i see as the high note of an already incredible career. What a cast!"
648,what?
649,"im so done with his shtick and the story looks very boring 

his animated films are better, this just looks stale"
650,"Unpopular Opinion, but Wes Anderson films are starting to get stale to me. I feel like he's found too much comfort in his style and hasn't really innovated for years. I like it when a director will go into new genres with their style and tell their version of a story. Wes Anderson has become like a TV show going into their 10th season where there's hardly any innovation and we just get the same thing as before."
651,The man's got a style and he fucking sticks to it
652,I've only said that about The Grand Budapest Hotel cause he really went all out with the aesthetic there. The French Dispatch is like a spiritual sequel in that sense
653,"I dunno, he's getting so Wes Anderson-y that I feel like he's kind of turning into Guy Maddin a bit."
654,"I‚Äôve been saying this for a while but I am fully ready for Wes to detonate his style and go for something totally new. 

It makes me think of Woody Allen‚Äôs early career. For years and years Woody had a distinctive, iconic formula for his comedy‚Äôs, which were mostly high concept, slapstick, 4th wall breaking films that got him his start. He became famous for the style. Then, years in he went and made Stardust memories, which was a knock on his own style and made fun of the fanatical fans who worshipped then.

From there in he dropped the over the top stylings and stripped everything waaaay back, and made his films far more character and story focused as opposed to sight gags and gimmicks. Entering a totally new phase. It was the growth of an artist who went from being pigeon holed to something far more pervasive and transcendent of any one style or thing.

I really really hope someday at least, Anderson challenges himself and dares to do something totally unexpected. He‚Äôs a true visionary but I do feel like he needs to get out of his comfort zone and push things in a new way."
655,Its always true though.
656,Yeah but this time it might be true
657,"> This looks like the most Wes Anderson film ever.

That was honestly my reaction as well. It's like Wes Anderson said, ""Hey, you know who makes good movies? That Wes Anderson fellow. I should make one in his style.""

It's like the Being John Malkovich of Wes Anderson movies."
658,Haha ya Crazy how a Wes Anderson movie would resemble a Wes Anderson movie
659,I really enjoyed his last movies Paddington 2 and JoJo Rabbit
660,How has this not happened? It‚Äôs a match made in heaven
661,He‚Äôs very good
662,"Christopher Waltz too, that list of secondary actors has me even more excited then the ones featured."
663,He once brought a loaded Beretta to a full house audition... just to feel the weight of it
664,I love that hes getting somewhat of a career renaissance due to how good he is in Barry
665,The Fonzzzz
666,I have obtained exactly one celebrity autograph in person (not counting sports figures). HW is that one and I cherish it.
667,"Man, when you have so many damn good actors in your movie that even the list of secondary actors contains names like Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Chirstoph Waltz, Henry Winkler, Elisabeth Moss.."
668,crazy to think his films have only won Best Production Design once (Grand Budapest Hotel) when production design is one of the biggest factors of his films.
669,And Costume design
670,Needs more symmetry and color pastels.
671,Still waiting for a horror flick in Wes Anderson‚Äôs color palette. Something like Rosemary‚Äôs Baby or the Amityville Horror.
672,"Although that last scene with the cops breaking into that room gave me a strong Blazing Saddles vibe, where the last bit of that movie is everyone fighting each other and busting through walls of a movie studio."
673,I dont know. I didnt see any(enough?) models
674,Reminds me of Wes Anderson‚Äôs [other film](https://youtu.be/gfDIAZCwHQE) A Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders
675,The exact middle of my yellow room
676,"Lmao. Cinema, right?"
677,Twitter is about to have an aneurysm seeing Chalamet in a bathtub.
678,Also the phone call from Ed Norton's character about kidnapping.
679,Franny and Zoey vibes
680,His voice and delivery are perfect for Wes Anderson's dialogue. Same goes for Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman.
681,"Owen and Jason being back put a big ole smile on my face. 

I also wish that Wilson and Anderson wrote together again. The three scripts they wrote together are some of my favorites by Wes. His stuff with other collaborators like Noah Baumbach are still incredible (The Life Aquatic ) m, there‚Äôs something about those first three movies that‚Äôs different from the rest of his filmography."
682,~~uh Wonder~~ oh you mean in a Wes Anderson movie
683,Wow
684,"You're joking right? Sarcasm doesn't translate well in text, or I am just true to my username.

He's been in plenty big movies since then."
685,Lightning McQueen.
686,lea seydoux probably. The trailer says she was the guard to the painter. The painter persuaded her to strip down for a nude portrait. There is a shot at 0:51 where she is striking a pose.
687,I vote Willem Dafoe and his mighty dong.
688,"The bathtub is a red herring I think, Timmy had it in his contract during CMBYN that he would do no full-frontal"
689,"I could always go for some Elisabeth Moss graphic nudity. But she looks like a very minor character, so not likely.

Also, she has been busy as fuck lately. I'm seeing her in everything. Reminds me of the period between 2012 and 2013 when Jude Law was basically in every movie."
690,We can only hope it‚Äôs a chala ding dong
691,Bill Murray
692,Wes is too heterosexual to put a dick on screen
693,Only Child. Illinois. CHICAGO
694,Clubs. Girls. Dancing. Naked. Mom? Argument. Fleeing the scene. Hiding in a dumpster. Coming here. Crashing on your couch for a week ‚Äòcause {technically I‚Äôm homeless}.
695,"Not just any journalism, but New Yorker journalism, which is (of course) the most Wes Anderson style of journalism."
696,I may have soiled my pants.
697,Bravo
698,Thanks Perd Hapley.
699,Well said
700,[r/perdverts](https://www.reddit.com/r/perdverts/)
701,You're fired.
702,Big if true
703,"How could you say something so controversial, yet so brave?"
704,I wanna watch a Wes Anderson Christmas Carol.
705,*[Weaooooooow](https://youtu.be/KlLMlJ2tDkg)*
706,It's practically the only movies he still does anymore. The man hasn't been in a movie since 2017.
707,Yep. And then you cry at the end.
708,Drop the Fox. Just Searchlight. Its cleaner.
709,I‚Äôll miss it.
710,We don't say the f-word anymore
711,Each new Wes Anderson movie looking like the most Wes Anderson movie since the last
712,"is there any other director of his kind? where one still of the movie or a single screenshot and you immediately know its a Wes Anderson picture? His movies are so distinctly unique and a breath of fresh air that i hope he keeps making movies until old age. You do you, Mr. Anderson!"
713,The song is a cover of [Aline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aline_(song\)) by Christophe. A french classic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_Hyn53acA
714,This trailer is already a shoe-in for best short film
715,It's releasing in July so there's still quite some time.
716,"It's a lot to do with the fact that he takes 2-3 years to make a movie (So there's a decent gap) and no one has successfully copied his style (Market isn't saturated). Plus the fact that his last one was Stop-Motion so it looked very different, so the actual last time we saw a movie like this was 6 years ago with Grand Budapest."
717,The Fresh Dispatch
718,"Just from watching the trailer, it looks like a movie I'm going to have to watch more than once to pick up on all the nuances."
719,I felt that way for Isle of Dogs. The Japanese style stood out compared to the sort of ‚Äústandard‚Äù Wes Anderson vibe
720,Probably because it‚Äôs Saoirse Ronan.
721,She profits tremendously off of black and white due to bright hair and even brighter eyes.
722,Its odd shes not mentioned in the casting at the end or even the cast list.
723,She also had the most beautiful shot in The Grand Budapest Hotel. Probably don't need to say which one because everybody who's seen the movie knows what I'm talking about but here it is https://youtu.be/dyd3JzIIm44
724,[And I'll watch](https://i.imgur.com/svAsJ8K.jpg)
725,Same
726,Surprised to see her name didn't appear in the main credits tho.
727,Even most of the actors that were listed but are not in the trailer are excellent!
728,That scene of the shoot out was the most Wes Anderson shoot out I've ever seen and I never realized how much I needed one.
729,"Shit, I'm gay. Foiled again."
730,Wait the Strokes made a new single?
731,"New [Strokes song?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CAz_vvsK9M)  hell yeah!

I went to a big school and it sucked, can I get another go?

edit:  that song was kinda weird."
732,"Find me a director Del Toro *wouldn't* work well with. Between The Usual Suspects, Sicario/Soldado, the MCU, Star Wars, this and whatever else - that man has incredible range."
733,"I thought he was Jemaine Clement at first, and now I really want to see Jemaine in a Wes Anderson film."
734,The Oscars was just a ruse!  Fooling us all because he knew ultimate messy hair was coming in less than a week.
735,That made me curious to check. Wes Anderson's cinematographer of choice Robert Yeoman was only nominated for Grand Budapest Hotel. Maybe this time? I love this style.
736,I think Dune would be up there with it.
737,"SAVE SOME OF THAT SHIT FOR ME, RUB IT ON MY GUMS"
738,Distilled Wes Anderson Clones. He blends them up and drinks them.
739,"That is what I thought, except I didn't like Buster Scruggs because it really didn't tie the narratives together well IMO. There was no real overarching story to keep it related. This looks like a great way to do it. Connecting the stories to a news journal that covered them keeps things together."
740,then go watch The New Pope!
741,"Its seemingly going to be about a paper that covers a few various stories, likely a lot of ""short films"" put into a single piece, with the papers being the connecting thread."
742,I think it‚Äôs basically law now that if one of them stars in a movie that the other must be in it too.
743,"""Aline"" (Christophe 1965)"
744,"It's Christophe - Aline, but I think it's a cover."
745,"cover of ""Aline"" by Christophe (1965)"
746,I understand the visual appeal of it.  But his movies bore the ever living hell out of me.
747,I just don‚Äôt get the appeal.
748,"I don't know man. Wes Amderson has created this shtick that is so unique to him that even Hollywood can't seem to emulate it like they always do with other stuff. 

If he was creating constant movies like that the way Marvel is currently doing,then you have a point. But he is only releasing his movies once every few years."
749,"It does feel like a little *too* Anderson, doesn't it? The trailer was almost distracting with how 'Anderson' it was? I didn't get the same feeling from any of his past works. Agreed that the style might be getting stale."
750,"There aren't very many directors with such distinctive visual style. I understand how some people could be turned off by the sameness of his work, but I love it. I also love ensemble casts and dry humor so really I'm just a sucker for it all."
751,"Whimsy, emotional detachment and pastel colours."
752,Got to love it. Although I did see some handheld and 360 dollying in there. Good to see some Rushmore Wes back.
753,I was thinking it was giving me Life Aquatic vibes
754,yet Rushmore is my favorite of his and it's the least Wes Andersony movie he's done. Don't get me wrong i love all his films but Rushmore is the tops
755,"The Wes aesthetic.  The westthetic, if you will."
756,"I'm always happy to have Wes, because there are so few people who do what he does, but at a certain point the sheer Wes-ness gets distracting. I have a hard time taking it all in because I'm like ""yup, there's the symmetry, there's the yellow text, there's Bill Murray..."""
757,"While I see where you are coming from I do not agree. There is only one Wes Anderson and I like that he makes movies that are very distinctly his.

Reminds me of the Gaiman quote that goes:

*""There are better writers than me out there, there are smarter writers, there are people who can plot better - there are all those kinds of things, but there‚Äôs nobody who can write a Neil Gaiman story like I can.""*"
758,"I'd argue that he already did that with his stop motion animation films. That was a pretty radical departure. This French Dispatch film also looks like a new phase with all the black and white and the action sequences. I mean, compare this to Rushmore, y'know? He's growing and changing, definitely. I can't say I agree with you. But I WILL say that's he definitely going in a 'MORE!' direction. The long, Altman-esque stylized extravaganzas. More stars, more expensive effects, more set pieces. I'm with you in the way that I would like to see a very simple film with one or two stars experiencing and interesting chapter in a relationship, told in a neighborhood in present day in a straight forward way. I kind of left the Wes Anderson train back around The Life Aquatic but I can dig what he's doing."
759,How is he going to keep topping it?  Just show a picture of Bill Murray for half the movie then the second half will be a stop motion rat?
760,"He has been killing it in Barry lately, will be a nice addition here."
761,Come here. Good to see you. You know what? Don't get too close to me. 'Cause I've got an itch you can't believe. I think something laid eggs on me.
762,This exactly what I first thought when i saw the cast list. Winkler is a pretty good fit to Anderson's brigade.
763,Children's Hospital was clearly a Wes Anderson movie
764,They can‚Äôt charge a husband and wife for the same crime
765,He wasn't.
766,"Not to be that loser, but his actual name is Christoph, it's not shortened from Christopher :)"
767,"This year, all of the nominees except *Parasite* were ""historical.""  I guess this looks ""historical"" enough that it will do well in that category."
768,And cinematography
769,Not enough quirky dialogue though
770,and characters at the edge of the frame looking back at the camera
771,"meanwhile, let this classic SNL skit tide you over

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfDIAZCwHQE"
772,[Obligatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfDIAZCwHQE) but in all honesty they really kinda nailed his style with this parody.
773,Colour out of space might not be pastel enough for you but it might do for now
774,There's this AMAZING edit of [The Shining and Grand Budapest Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsi06PG7w_0) that really brings that all home.
775,"Oh man, yes"
776,With the orange couch and pink cushions
777,"Twitter gets an aneurysm whenever chalamet does literally *anything* so yeah, they're all dead right now. rip"
778,"The dude dabbed in awards show, he is the true messiah"
779,"I keep seeing this mentioned, Twitter going crazy on chalamet. What's up with that? Is he just latest teen heart-throb or something?"
780,That's Wes Anderson's Holy Trinity.
781,Timothee Chalamet fits so well in Anderson‚Äôs style too which I totally did not see coming.
782,"They came up together. I tend to forget that Owen actually co-wrote Wes's first three films, which is crazy to think about when you realize that includes Rushmore & Tenenbaums."
783,Until the Grand Budapest The Life Aquatic was my favorite.
784,Watched Bottle Rocket for the first time last night and the dialogue was fantastic.
785,if Seydoux is what the typical prison guard looks like then I'm not surprised there's so many riots over there
786,...You‚Äôre absolutely right. Darn!
787,"She‚Äôs fragile, but not that fragile."
788,seydoux gave kojima and anderson a 2 for 1 deal.
789,she doesn‚Äôt seem like the type who would be open to nudity or sex in a movie though
790,"Ye fond of me penis, ain't yer ?"
791,I like to imagine his dick just making directors go mad. Like it's some kind of Eldritch God swinging between his legs. No director is capable of harnessing it for a scene. It almost killed Lars von Trier.
792,haaaaaark!
793,We can only hope...
794,In that case I‚Äôm a fan of his lobster ;)
795," Hark Triton, HARK! Bellow, bid our father the Sea King rise from the depths full foul in his fury!"
796,IIRC James ivory was pissed at that he wanted full graphic nudity to truly represent gay love. He thought the censored contracts restricted the movie
797,"Her being a Scientologist really turns me off to all of her work tbh, I'd like to see less of her. A small part in Wes Anderson, sure, I can be on board with that but I am ready for her streak to end. Drives me crazy that her ""banner"" role is her most hypocritical."
798,"2012/13 Jude Law I don't think I've seen a single movie from that period with him in it. 2004 Jude Law was in so much shit that he had to take a year off lol I Heart Huckabees, Alfie, Closer, The Aviator, Sky Captain, and Series of Unfortunate Events"
799,"Oh man, did you see Her Smell? Performance of the fucking year. She's amazing."
800,What‚Äôs the most impressive is she became really successful after mad men ended when she was in her 30s. It‚Äôs rare for a female actor to have success in films after years of doing tv exclusively especially in middle age. Choosing to do indie was prettt smart move it had her get a reputation of being an acclaimed film actress
801,"I'm sorry, Mr. Park!"
802,RESPECT!!!
803,Its so metaphorical
804,"The poster reminded me of Chris Ware's work (a Chicago ""comic book"" artist.)"
805,This was [definitely my favorite part of the new Star Wars trilogy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIFBgY2IqeQ)

811,Oh yeah that too.
812,But the thing that I really do love about Wes‚Äô films is that you grow a little bit after experiencing that melancholy. Those few films where you really feel what the character is going through- I think that‚Äôs what makes his films so special.

816,"Nothing will ever be more Wes Anderson than Budapest. That was peak Anderson from a stylistic standpoint. I found Moonrise Kingdom to be so painfully Anderson that it actually took me out of the story, and resulted in one of my least favorite Andersons. But Budapest was 100x more Anderson to the point where it got so ridiculous that it wrapped around and became amazing to me again.


But this looks *very* Anderson with some new tricks (black and white, rotating shots, anamorphic lens(?)) so I'm excited."
817,"It's funny how everyone has basically the same reaction, ""yup that's a Wes Anderson movie"". It makes sense, he has a style that draws attention to itself a lot. Personally that has never been my thing, but there are some nice looking shots I can't deny"
818,"I'll argue that currently JoJo Rabbit holds the title of the most Wes Anderson movie since the last, despite Wes Anderson not having anything to do with it"
819,"He does always have very particular cinematography. But there are some other directors with their own ""style"" that is distinctively noticeable. Edgar Wright jumps to mind."
820,Plenty.  Yasujir≈ç Ozu was making movies that were distinctly his based on any single frame in the 1940s.
821,Edgar Wright and Tarantino I guess
822,"Fincher comes to mind, very distinct as well but in a more subtle manner.

Anderson's style is definitely the most ""in your face obvious"" though."
823,"[Roy Andersson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7pna4laaAk).

One need only see a single frame from one of his movies and you'll just know it's his."
824,Roy Andersson for sure. His films are just a series of still shots designed to look like paintings though so it's sort of cheating (though you could kind of say the same for Wes Anderson then).
825,"Like godbottle said, Wes is *heavily* inspired by Ozu. [It's most noticeable in the framing of his shots.](https://imgur.com/a/EGyaol3)"

832,And Grand Budapest was wonderful. This looks great.
833,Grand Budapest was SIX years ago?? Good lord.

If you sat me down and told me JoJo Rabbit was a Wes Anderson movie I would 100% believe you."
835,"> no one has successfully copied his style

i'm not gonna say they ""copied"" his style per se but more like they were inspired by it, but i definitely felt some heavy Wes Anderson vibes from Richard Ayoade's *Submarine* (a great underrated, underseen movie) and *Paddington 2*."

849,His ensemble casts have always been great but this is a whole other level.
850,"Ehn... I don't really understand beyond silly people will be silly. 

If you don't like it in general, I get it, but is not like this is something everyone is doing, so how are you getting turned off by a style you only get to experience every 3 years? Specially when he is so good at it and constantly evolving and finding new ways to play. 

I mean, Grand Budapest Hotel was six years ago."
851,Micheal Bay says hello. You can spot his direction a mile away...and also get motion sickness at the same time.
852,"I love the cast too, but yeah I‚Äôm definitely one of those people who can‚Äôt stand his style. Might give this a shot based on the cast alone though."
853,there is something so warm and sentimental about all his movies.  they are like a nice bowl of chicken noodle soup.  not the most exciting but damn enjoyable and comforting.
854,"Yeah like, I'm not a big fan, but there are very few directors working today where you can see one still frame from one of their films and know instantly that it's theirs. Something to be said for that"
855,"I'm personally getting a little tired of his shtick, but respectfully. The man's still an incredibly talented filmmaker."

867,"Good quote. I‚Äôll be more specific I don‚Äôt want him to run in the opposite direction, I want him to retain his sensibility, but GROW it. Evolve it.

He can still give the same wit, and treatment of character but there are ways to add twists to keep it fresh.

Bottle Rocket rocket, for instance is of my favorite films of his. It‚Äôs so stripped back, but all of his hallmarks are there. Bottle Rocket does however feel as if it takes place in the real world and not just the ‚ÄúWes Anderson Universe‚Äù. It‚Äôs little things like that that can help discern one film from another."
868,"Also his style actually allows for him to be more creative while keeping cost reasonable.

I recall a lot of scenes in moonrise where shot from the single perspective because the reverse shot of the scene didn't work.

It's like if you needed to film the Great Pyramids for a movie but didn't have the budget or ability to green screen out the Pizza Hut across the street. You'd just shoot the single perspective shot. Wes has just taken that ""box"" and kept exploring it. Forcing limitations on your art can force creativity in ways you'd never realize without restriction."

920,"I was telling my wife this trailer exhibits what I like most about Anderson's live work compared to animation. His carefully crafted and artificial symmetry/asymmetry looks amazing in a real world environment because it feels like heightened reality, but in animation I found that style to feel so planned that it didn't bring the same joy"
921,Auteurs
922,First one that came to mind.
923,I mean I'm sure he could enter it but it would 1000% not get nominated
924,It indeed was.

938,Isle of Dogs was 2018 tho
939,"The style has influenced other movies though? Most recently Jojo Rabbit which could pass for a Wes Anderson movie. Hell, it even ends with the main characters dancing. And to a Bowie song!"
940,rarity doesn't mean likeable. Style and preference is all subjective and things with strong taste or style can be off putting to some. Personally I love  but I could see how a person might think it's uninteresting or distracting

947,O you!
948,"I mean there‚Äôs a reason Bottle Rocket feels stripped back. It‚Äôs cause it‚Äôs his very first feature-length directorial debut. So you‚Äôre not really asking for him to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù but return to his roots. I‚Äôm not saying that argument is without merit though. I think it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to say that his quirks, stylings, and artifice (and I love them to bits) can get in the way of the story and make for a less immersive experience as the fancifully elements overwhelm

And I say this as someone who loves modern Wes. His moves are like watching an original fairytale and isn‚Äôt something I can readily find from other directors"
949,"I hear what you are saying, but he has evolved.

Into this.

He took his whimsical wit and made the whole world, architecture... even the frame of the picture behave in the same way. I think he just reached his peak style with Grand Budapest Hotel.

There are other writers, directors and TV shows, that were influenced and/or borrow a lot from Wes, that end up doing something closer to what you are saying. But he does things now that one else does.

So I while I would be interested in something stripped back, we will mostly be missing something unique like what this looks like."
950,"I think you just might not be a fan of Wes Anderson's visual style. As a person who is, it is pretty clear in my opinion that his style is growing and evolving, but just not in the direction you want it to. If you watch Rushmore, then this trailer, you see that the style has been pushed way more to it's extreme. Same thing if you look at Tenenbaums to Grand Budapest Hotel for exemple. He is testing the limits more and more, and to see a director of his calibre explore his style deeper and deeper is to me much more exciting than for him to cut back on it to become more conventional.

Plenty other filmmakers to watch if I want a more naturalistic style."
951,Those are balls.
952,"Did you watch the movie? It was designed by acclaimed architect Namgoong Hyeonja

981,What didn‚Äôt you like in the trailer? It got me fairly interested and excited for the story.
982,"I know, but that's animation. Besides, people are more used to seeing some more stylistic in that genre. It doesn't stand out next to contemporary films like Ruben Brandt, Collector, or Mirai, hell, next to something like Into the Spider-Verse, Isle of Dogs feel traditional."
983,"Is it good? I‚Äôve got it on my watch list but not got around to it

Mainly because I love dogs (yes I know it‚Äôs puppet/animation type) and I can‚Äôt watch anything that might be sad in any way when it comes to dogs."

985,Isle of Dogs just came out in 2018
986,And thin mustaches on everyone
987,Son of a bitch I‚Äôm sick of these dolphins.
988,"You know, every movie that I see these days puts a dark mirror in front  of me and asks me to reflect on the terrible undercurrent of corruption and -ism and inequality in the world.

There's a real place for that.  Films that do this are important - not only for democracy, but for self-reflection and growth.  Parasite won an Oscar doing this, and it deserved it.  Great film.

But Jesus, Christ, everything has to be so down to earth.  Even the superhero films are grounded and depressing sometimes.

Wes Anderson's films take you away from this reality.  There's conflict, sure, but for a few hours there's real aesthetic beauty whisking you away from real world problems.  There's whimsy.  There's wonder.  But it all takes place in a parallel world that isn't quite this one.

And I just need it sometimes.  I need to be in that other world, because sometimes this one is simply too cruel or too uncivil or too same-y.

So please, Mr. Anderson, keep taking me away from this world on small journeys, because a movie theater is so much more convenient than spending the day at an art gallery."
989,"Personally, I hope he never does take his hand out of his films. It would be such a loss. I do want to see him do something chilling or spooky. Maybe a film version of an Edward Gorey book like, ‚ÄòThe Hapless Child.‚Äô"
990,"I‚Äôve been a fan of his visual style and followed it closely for years. I think Fantastic Fox actually revitalized him as a visual storyteller which gave way to how dynamic and kinetic Moonrise Kingdom was.

The films do differ visually to a degree. But they could easily be construed as different stories within a shared universe.

I‚Äôm just saying I‚Äôd love to look back at his career and see more versatile ‚Äúphases‚Äù. Like I‚Äôd love to see him just grab a steady cam and shoot something totally in black and white, or do something that only takes place in one location.

Tarantino is great example of what I‚Äôm talking about. You couldn‚Äôt miss it was Tarantino for a second but even he spreads it out, so one film is a sweeping multiple location epic, the next is a 3 act play trapped in a single locale, the other is a twist on a non-fiction story. Even Tarantino is mindful to challenge his limits while still celebrating his sensibilities."
991,You are king of suck balls mountain.
992,"I just read an article on designing that house on indiewire. Really fascinating stuff in regards to why it was built that way and Bong's past as a tutor and student influencing the film.

994,"I like how you covered just the last two words, as if they could say anything else given that context."
995,"I was at a screening of Parasite that had that live Q+A after.

How was it listening to him (and his translator) talk about the film? Our stream only covered about half of the interview from what we could tell so I reckon we missed a good chunk of it overall."
996,And it wasn't even nominated!
997,He's also making his West End debut this year.  Kid is crazy busy.
998,"He's not it's Greig Fraser who shot Rogue One and Zero Dark Thirty. So the movies in capable hands, Fraser is also doing the Matt Reeves Batman movie."
999,"I feel like Driver *commits* to his SNL roles in a way that you don't often see from the guests. Like, watching that oil baron sketch, I now want to see him actually play an elderly oil baron in some kind of There Will Be Blood style movie. Undercover Boss just *is* Kylo Ren. He brought the exact same energy, with no half measures and no winking. It's amazing how much he doesn't hold back, on SNL or anywhere else for that matter."
1000,*LOOK AT ME BOY*
1001,The oil baron skit is one of the funniest things I have ever seen off of snl. The fact that almost everyone else breaks but he doesnt at all adds to it as well.

1008,You know what I mean?
1009,"That's a decent amount of Andersons, I too enjoyed it very much."
1010,"I felt it wasn't all that Japanese influenced, just on a superficial level. Felt more like the whole japan thing was just used to make the audience have the same language barrier that dogs have to humans. And the rest of the cultural references were just a bonus side effect."
1011,LoTR but all the elves are leprechauns.
1012,"Tenet has Hoyte van Hoytema. You're right that's tough. Dune has Greg Fraser who did Rogue One and Zero Dark Thirty, so that at least gives us a sense of what look they're trying to achieve with Dune. Rogue One is probably the *best* looking Star Wars movie in the Disney era."
1013,Is Deakins signed on to anything right now?
1014,There was that one shot of Jojo and his mum cycling across the horizon of a bright green field and turquoise sky that I thought was particularly Anderson.
1015,"""What's that K in the corner for?""


""That stands for Klaus."""
1016,"What I‚Äôve found interesting about his films is they are whimsical/twee on the surface but mostly center around incredibly painful topics like mental illness, suicide, parental abandonment/death, war, etc. - almost all of his films are an iron fist in a velvet glove. So when I watch one of them, I‚Äôm seeing the darkness you‚Äôre talking about but with a cheerful facade."
1017,"You said it, man."
1018,"*every* movie you see these days makes you reflect on corruption and inequality?

maybe our brains are just wired different, but unless those are core themes of the movie im scarcely thinking of stuff outside of the film. surely there are loads of movies you've seen in the past few years (other than Wes Anderson films) that haven't made you think of that sort of stuff."
1019,"You seem to be conflating Tarantino's stories with his visual style. It being trapped in a single locale, or a non fiction story, has to do with the type of stories he is telling (and thank god he switched those up from the litany of revenge stories that he was doing before Hateful Eight) and not at all to do with how he visually prevents these stories.

Wes Anderson stories while they often do have thematic similarities (often about a person who believes in romantic values in a world that doesn't, as can be seen in Rushmore or Moonrise Kingdom for example) I can easily describe his films as one taking place almost all on a boat, another an stop motion film about foxes, or a story about an old hotel.

To me what you are asking is like wishing Hitchcock made less thrillers, or Cuaron to do a film with quick cuts instead of a long one take shots, or Jean Renoir to have forgone his indiosyncratic style for the sake of variety. In all these cases, these things are what made them stand apart from the rest and what makes us or will make us remember them. While repeating the same story isn't great (as I felt Tarantino was for awhile), switching a visual style when it is part of the fabric of the filmmaker isn't."
1020,"Maybe the cost to film in Korea is a bit lower. But yeah, it‚Äôs insane what they manage to do with such small budget"
1021,I should probably edit it yeah. Sorry if I spoilt it for you man
1022,"It was really good yeah, the translator is the same one they had for the oscars and was amazing at conveying his humour and it was really cool to have Song-Kang Ho (the Kim family dad there) to talk about his experiences"
1023,"Loved both those movies, with Rogue One being my favorite post-Disney movie. Having high hopes for Dune"
1024,Driver commits to his Bobs Burgers appearances.
1025,"His new SNL had a bunch of great skits. Even the dumb ones, like you say, he just *commits* to"
1026,He does kinda look like bale from machinist
1027,"I didn't care for it the first time I watched it, then watched it again on an airplane last year and fucking *loved* it.  Definitely top-tier Anderson."
1028,"Dick ye to Hell, Winslow!"
1029,I've seen it! You're fond of me dick!
1030,I felt a lot of the cinematography was very much a blend of Anderson's symmetry and Kurosawa's painting like sense of blocking. Also the set design and score definitely suggested it was more of a genuine appreciation for the culture than an artificial recreation.
1031,"""I asked for a sword and you hand me a breakfast cereal?"""
1032,"Nope, no 2020 films as of right now according to IMDB or Wikipedia"
1033,I don't disagree.  I'm just thankful for the velvet.
1034,"Well said, but it‚Äôs funny you mention Hitchcock because he did exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. Hitchcock for years made thrillers, became the ‚Äúmaster of suspense. His budgets got bigger and bigger and bigger where he was making these dizzying, epics like Vertigo, and blockbusters like The Birds. He eventually grew to point where studios couldn‚Äôt handle the extravagance and demands that came with these stories to where Hitchcock nearly burned out.

Then, late in his career he decided to mix it up and do something totally unconventional and unprecedented by making a little film called Psycho.

Psycho, was a fraction the budget of his other films. It was all black and white. It was an almost schlocky horror/ proto slasher novel that wouldn‚Äôt have been immediately seeming to be something in Hitchcock‚Äôs wheelhouse. And yet, when it comes out completely changes the game and alters cinema as a business and as an audience experience forever.

He makes the film, which he demands audiences actually show up on time or be denied entrance ( unheard of at the time, people used to just show up whenever)

Then markets the film on a movie star, only to have them slaughtered, shockingly in the first 45 minutes. Makes it the first film to feature a toilet, and pushes boundaries on sexuality and inclusion of nudity in a mainstream film. After the film came out showing up to films on time became a norm BECAUSE of Psycho. And filmmakers were taught you take major risks on main characters to toy with audience expectations. 

Hitchcock zagged on his audiences in one of the most significant, major ways that ever occurred in cinema history way late into his career. It‚Äôs possible to do, and so rewarding when a director steps up and does it."
1035,Films cost way less everywhere outside of the states. American actors costs way more and the use of cgi is extremely cost prohibitive. How crazy is it that this beautifully shot movie cost less to make than Super Troopers 2?
1036,"Haha nah, it‚Äôs all good I‚Äôve seen it. Honestly I don‚Äôt think it really ruins much even if you haven‚Äôt. Just thought it was funny."
1037,Looks like Bale from Little Women
1038,"I'm a dickie, and a dickie I is."
1039,"""How many lembas marshmallows have you eaten?""

""Four."""
1040,"Psycho came out 2 years after Vertigo and 3 years before The Birds.  It was made so cheaply because Paramount did not want him to make it so he made it with his television crew. Even so, Psycho is not markedly different from Hitchcock's style and more importantly Vertigo is widely considered one of the single greatest films of all time, so it's ridiculous to say he stepped up from it."
1041,"what are you trying to say about super troopers 2, partner?"
1042,Also kinda looks like a little woman.
1043,Not much except I loved the 1st one and fell asleep during 2. And that it cost more to make than Parasite.
1044,Bob Dylan?
1045,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there a plan for a 21 Jump Street/Men In Black crossover?

Do Lord and Miller get credit for a film not being made?"
1046,"I don‚Äôt get the hate for sequels since they don‚Äôt change the original work.

I often want to see more of a character or a universe. If the new story is good, then everybody wins. If it‚Äôs not good, we can just ignore it and keep liking the first one(s)."
1047,I think you're confused about why there weren't more sequels...
1048,"24 Jump Street is currently In the works and may lead to a spin off with Tiffany Haddish and Awkwafina. 

https://screenrant.com/24-jump-street-phil-lord/

https://youtu.be/ftenN87QA_w"
1049,I feel the exact opposite.  More movies please.
1050,You obviously don't keep up with what they have going on
1051,"Yes, and i believe a 3rd movie (not the MIB crossover) is still trying to be made."
1052,"Because most of the people on this sub are unoriginal  and keep parroting the idea that every film should be a one off original film and remakes/sequels/reboots/etc. are bad.

Its really annoying and comes off as dismissive and pretentious. 

Unless the film is a shot for shot, word for word, remake/adaptation it still has merit since its still creating something to be on screen. It doesnt ruin the original work by existing.

I have never heard someone say a good film is now terrible because it has a bad followup."
1053,"Yep, 24 Jump Street is apparently in development."
1054,and i‚Äôll watch. if Lord and Miller direct of course
1055,Looks like 24 Jump Street is going to star Tiffany Haddish and Zendaya and be directed by one of the writers of 22 Jump Street.
1056,i‚Äôm out. can‚Äôt stand tiffany haddish
1057,"I think Alita would have been better as a full CG animated film.  The actress being completely CG looked awkward and was distracting the whole movie.

The directing was noticeably worse than Ghost in the Shell and the visuals were comparable.

Alita felt like a young adult novel movie, Ghost in the Shell was a dark gritty cyberpunk.

I quite liked Alita, but I don't see how you can say it was solidly better than Ghost in the Shell."
1058,"The problem with the live action Ghost in the Shell is that not only did they vastly dumb down the source material, but they also didn't really adapt the story, they made it more a knock off of Robocop. At least Alita actually adapted the story from the manga/anime, can't say the same for Ghost in the Shell."
1059,"Oh boy, directed by the guy who did A Ghost Story

hype"
1060,"Here‚Äôs a little bit [higher res](https://i.imgur.com/7DWdL7h.jpg) version of the poster! 

From IMDb: 

>	A fantasy re-telling of the medieval story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

Starring Dev Patel, Alicia Vikander, Joel Edgerton, Sarita Choudhury, Sean Harris, Kate Dickie, and Barry Keoghan. Directed by David Lowery (A Ghost Story). 

Dope poster, I‚Äôm super excited for this. Hop on over to /r/A24 as well if you get the chance!"
1061,That tagline font and orientation is incredibly hard to read.
1062,"I'm sorry, but the vertical lettering in whatever script that is was terrible. Whoever thought that would be a good choice for a poster layout confuses me. can someone just type out what that's supposed to say?"
1063,"Directed by David Lowery (A Ghost Story).
Looking forward to this."
1064,Is this a sequel to Green Book or Green Room?
1065,"Anyone know if this an adaptation of anything specific?
Always loved the legend of Gawain and the green knight."
1066,[And there was much rejoicing](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/IncredibleSevereFiddlercrab-size_restricted.gif)
1067,Lowery also did the charming The Old Man & the¬†Gun 2 years go. I know there's only 12 of us who've seen it but still think it's worth mentioning.
1068,By ze lady?
1069,Hi all- BRON Studios here. Thanks so much for all of the kind words about the poster! We can‚Äôt wait for you all to see the trailer tomorrow.
1070,"FINALLY! 

This movie has been on my list forever. Really excited to see another David Lowery movie :)"
1071,"Love David Lowrey and the cast. Not usually into medieval movies, but I can't wait for this"
1072,Wow. Really good poster. I hope it's a good film.
1073,If nothing else that is a superb poster
1074,this poster is delicious
1075,easily in my top 3 most anticipated this year. David Lowery is a genius and among our finest working today. so excited to *finally* see what this looks like.
1076,One of my favorite books as a kid. I‚Äôm pretty sure Sean Connery did a rake on this in the 70s or 80s?
1077,[Textless version](https://i.imgur.com/XaS7oOv.jpg).
1078,Isn't there already a Sean Connery version of this story?
1079,The best thing about this is Finchy is playing the Green Knight.
1080,This is one of my most anticipated summer movies
1081,wow. that's a really intriguing poster.
1082,"At this point I don't even need a trailer. 
I totally trust A24"
1083,Love me some David Lowery. Definitely watching this.
1084,"David Lowery is directing (Ain‚Äôt Them Bodies Saints, A Ghost Story, Pete‚Äôs Dragon, Old Man and the Gun) so it‚Äôs going to look fucking beautiful. Can‚Äôt wait to see a trailer"
1085,"This looks pretty cool.

Dune trailer when?"
1086,A medival a24 flick? Colour me interested.
1087,Remember the version with Sean Connery?
1088,Aight time to butcher some Arthuriana
1089,I'm interested!
1090,Fun fact: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight was the movie we were supposed to be watching in my senior English class on 9/11. You had to have the TV set to channel 3 or 4 for vcrs to work and that's the the NBC station here. The teacher was having trouble getting the vcr to work and as we waited we saw the plane hit the 1st tower. The rest is history. Don't remember if we ever saw the movie.
1091,The Sean Connery version of this movie was weird as hell
1092,[nice poster](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/909/034/22b.png)
1093,"My absolute favorite Arthurian legend. Tolkien did a great translation. I could never bring myself to watch Sean Connery version. 

This poster and the director makes me thing horror-direction, but not sure that would make a ton of sense, save the grisly opening scene.

*I see the mom and dad from The VVitch are reuniting in this"
1094,"I mean this has pretty much become the standard in recent years, hasn't it? 

Poster today, trailer tomorrow.

Also, FOR ZE LADY!"
1095,Isn't Joaquin Phoenix going to be part of this as well? He supposedly just finished shooting a movie with A24
1096,Been waiting for this for a while. And by a while I mean 700 years.
1097,This is my favorite story ever. I'm fucking hyped.
1098,"I remember the awful Green Knight movie with Sean Connery. Ooooooh it was bad. I remember the actor who played Gawain was like a parody of handsome. He had a huge square jaw, pale white skin, flowing blonde hair. He was like a cross between a romance novel cover and Hitler's wet dream."
1099,I‚Äôve never been to a Medieval Times.
1100,What does the text on the sides say My dyslexia doesn‚Äôt like it at all.
1101,sean harris...this guy can't escape medieval movies
1102,"*A24 farts*

1103,Marvel or DC??
1104,But he‚Äôs not wearing green!
1105,Holy Grail prequel
1106,"bad poster... sorry no hype from this.  No context or clue what its about from some random knight in profile with a foofy crown, incredibly hard to read text, desire to research further is minimal."
1107,Another 1?
1108,"No offense, but this does not look historically accurate (fiction or not) at all:

Cast

Dev Patel as Sir Gawain

Seriously?

Edit: and you can downvote, but it is still not accurate at all. That is a hard fact."
1109,Bro it's the black knights cousin
1110,Did A24 direct it?
1111,Can't wait for him to eat Green Eggs and Ham in a single take lasting 28 minutes!
1112,The Old Man and the Gun was great.
1113,With Martin Freeman? Easily one of the most disappointing films of the last few years.
1114,"> A fantasy re-telling of the medieval story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

I wonder if they'll lean quite heavily into horror territory with some of the more unsettling parts of the poem. I can see it either being a python-esque comedy, or a brutal psychological character study."
1115,"I hadn‚Äôt heard of this but Sir Gawain and the Green Night is one of the best medieval stories, and Dev Patel is incredible, so I‚Äôm suddenly really excited"
1116,That's quite the cast; I am hyped!
1117,Impressive design artwork.
1118,[this old classic again?](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/US1sheet.jpg/220px-US1sheet.jpg)
1119,"Sounds cool!

Barry *Keoghan* (pronounced kyohwan) is his surname."
1120,"Thanks, I wonder why mods let images with low resolution be posted here. I think a limit in minimal resolution should be setup to avoid this posts.(at least on posters posts)"
1121,"Great cast, I‚Äôll check it out."
1122,Fucking. Pumped.
1123,damn it I had the idea for this movie years ago lol
1124,"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is easily one of my favorite knights of the round table stories, very excited for this!"
1125,DEV PATEL OOO
1126,My thoughts exactly. At first glance I didn‚Äôt even realize it was text. Then I did and wasted my time figuring out what it said.
1127,The poster would likely look better without it too.

1145,Thanks for taking the time to see what the r/movies community had to say!
1146,">:)

:)"
1147,March.
1148,Right?! I'm really curious to see the trailer for this
1149,It won't be a horror version. The script is floating around and it's more fantasy-romance leaning.
1150,That‚Äôs a different film!
1151,People like what they like. Nothing wrong with that either way you look at it.
1152,"I‚Äôm no movie snob, in fact I hate most movies. My favorite over the past year was Godzilla KOTM. 

But everything I‚Äôve seen from A24 has been very enjoyable. I even liked Barely Lethal."
1153,"You're the outlier, then. I think the poster looks sleek and nice, though admittedly the vertical lettering is a little off-putting. Still, I like the contrasts and colors. I immediately wanted to know more about the project.

Better than seeing another low-effort mishmash of actors' faces against some generic city background with violet and orange coloring and *sparks,* or some shit."
1154,"I would imagine something to do with ‚ÄúSir Gawain and the Green Knight‚Äù.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight"
1155,"You're aware that we're talking about a story where a mythical knight meets a giant who can remove his own head, right? Why would you possibly care if it's historically accurate? What is it accurate to? It's not a ""hard fact"" to say it's inaccurate, because there wasn't a real Gaiwan to match the casting to."
1156,"It says it‚Äôs a fantasy retelling, so I guess they can do whatever with the source and setting, including a more racially varied cast than some old movies.

But also you did have a lot of islamic movement through Europe in the dark ages (before the crusades were islamic attacks on europe), so who knows where lone knight errant equivalents might have ended up."
1157,"Poem regarding mythical lore =\= historical accuracy 

... lets not forget that Britain hasn‚Äôt been white since the Romans too. 

Must be awful picking your cinema outings based on your own subjective perception of history :("
1158,">No offense, but this does not look historically accurate

Who ever said that was meant to be the point?

>Dev Patel as Sir Gawain
>Seriously?

Oh no. You're one of those."
1159,"Gawain is typically portrayed as white, but African and Middle Eastern knights were on the Round Table in major Arthurian works as early as the 1200's.  I'm not aware of any stories including an Indian knight but the round table was far better traveled than knights of the period would actually have been.  Arthurian legend takes place in a distinctly ahistorical world where the Welsh conquered the Roman Empire, so having a more ethnically diverse group of knights than would have actually been found in the court of a 6th century King of the Britons isn't really the biggest historical discrepancy the story needs to contend with."
1160,"First name A

Last name TwentyFour

And yes."
1161,"No, with Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara"
1162,"Nope, you are talking about Ghost stories. It's a bit disappointing indeed, but some people enjoyed it

A Ghosty Story is an A24 movie, starred by Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck"
1163,An Arthurian psychological thriller? Yes please.
1164,It's the director of A Ghost Story so probably not a comedy
1165,"yeah i'm picturing a pythonesque thing too :D

gawain: ""but, kind sir, you will surely die!!""

GG: ""nonsense!! it'll be but a scratch!!"""
1166,"Really, really solid cast all around. I haven‚Äôt heard of the story it‚Äôs based on before!"
1167,There's a JRR Tolkein translation available that is really great and easy to read.
1168,"This was my absolute favorite to read as a kid, haven't revisited King Arthur anything in a long while so I'm super excited!"
1169,"can't wait for it to be rated low on IMDB because Dev Patel ""doesn't fit the character's origins"""
1170,Yeah and that poster is amazing.
1171,It seriously is! I‚Äôm really excited for this.
1172,"Thanks for the clarification, I corrected it!"
1173,"""When honor was everything"" & ""When courage made kings""

I personally blame it on the low res. At good quality it won't be hard to read."
1174,"Thank you. Couldn't make that out on my phone screen. 

Edit: I have absolutely no clue why someone would downvote your comment when all you did was type out the script."
1175,And a [textless version](https://i.imgur.com/XaS7oOv.jpg).

1178,"9/10, if you had redone the main title as well I would have died laughing"
1179,"Honestly, I even think the original script wouldn't be that horrible if it wasn't in a perfect vertical line. But yeah, that is a lot better than the actual image"
1180,What did they reference before?
1181,Bluntman?
1182,It seems to be an adaptation of the medieval alliterative poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.
1183,no that's The Batman
1184,"We plan to be here more often! I handle the community management for the studio and I‚Äôm a Redditor myself, so it only makes sense that I bridge the Reddit professional gap.

1187,"It was more of a joke. I enjoy a lot of A24 movies, my favorite might be Good Time."
1188,"Not just the vertical lettering, ""the green knight"" in red?  Artistic maybe but doesn't work for me.  Maybe it is my cynical nature but I like my knights gritty and without the religious iconography.  Id take another Gladiator over noble crusaders any day."
1189,"Did read that, don't think I have ever heard of that fable.  Seen most if not all of the Arthurian movies but never bothered to read into it more.  Might be decent, if the purity and piety is not overdone, but with a halo on the poster I doubt that."
1190,"I mean, a greenskinned man is going to get his head chopped off and then he will walk over and put his head back on."
1191,"Read below, this is not something racist or subjective, take the fold out of your eyes. I mentioned it is as ridiculous as Ricardo Montalban as a japanese guy in that Marlon Brando movie and as stupid as Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in the Shell.

It actually resembles that campaign from Barnes & Noble about celebrating diversity that caused so much outrage.

But ok, I guess we can just wait for Leonardo Di Caprio to show up as Moctezuma in the next movie. I mean, why not? Let‚Äôs kill our subjective perception of history. üòÜ"
1192,"Im kinda with him. I still laugh about John Wayne being cast as Genghis Khan.

Im not outraged by it, but I am disappointed."
1193,"And then people ask themselves why that ‚Äúnasty‚Äù Brexit happened?

What is next? Kelly Marie Tran as an aztec woman? 
Chris Rock as Christopher Colombus?
Brad Pitt as a mayan?

Give me a break guys. There is nothing wrong in creating new, innovative, and diverse characters, why not? I am interested myself to watch Dev Patel as Arjuna for instance, in a serious movie, the same way I am interested in Chris Rock in that new Saw movie, and I am not interested in seeing Brad Pitt anymore üòÇ

But, replacing characters to fit a narrative in fashion? That is what makes some people angry and creates a bad environment for everyone, and if it was the other way around it would not be tolerated."
1194,"Oh, gotcha. I never saw that one but it looks like it's good."
1195,"He also directed Pete's Dragon and The Old Man and the Gun so I wouldn't take A Ghost Story as indicative of the tone of every film he will do. Nevertheless, considering the tone of the poster and the fact that A24 picked it up rather than a bigger studio I'm inclined to agree that it probably will be more similar to A Ghost Story and definitely not a comedy."
1196,"Black Knight sitting on a stool in the back because no legs, drinking mead through a straw because no arms:  ""We went to school together."""

1199,"[Good quality](https://i.imgur.com/7DWdL7h.jpg) got posted higher upthread, and the font is still terrible. Maybe if the letters were bigger and written horizontally it wouldn't be as much of an issue, but it's pretty bad as is."
1200,Thank you. I gave up on the second one when i tried to read it
1201,that's actually pretty cool and wallpaper-worthy. looks like Kanye West's next album.
1202,Could you remove the dude as well?
1203,Does the Green Knight have his own Megazord?
1204,Probably  Pete's Dragon
1205,C‚Äômon C‚Äômon.
1206,"Sure, I was a little thrown off by that too, but the Green Knight seems to be more of a secondary character so I think it's fine. And to my knowledge religion is still a major factor in medieval literature and the period itself, though I admit I don't know much about this particular story... I'm guessing that it will have a fair mix of both grittiness and religious subject matter. We'll see."
1207,Are you under the illusion that Sir Gaiwan was a real person?
1208,Or Ricardo Montalban as a japanese guy. God that was stupid and awful as fuck.
1209,">I still laugh about John Wayne being cast as Genghis Khan

Yeah, this isnt the same thing.

It's entirely possible Patel was the best audition. You cannot sit there and tell me that Wayne was the best audition for that role.

This is nowhere near the same situation."
1210,">And then people ask themselves why that ‚Äúnasty‚Äù Brexit happened?

Are....you telling me that Dev Patel caused Brexit by **daring** to go against your deepest wishes that he not take this role?

>makes some people angry

Yeah, mostly people who dont know what they're talking about and can be left to yell into the void ;)"
1211,Exactly what is being replaced?
1212,if you want to watch Rooney Mara eat an entire pie in one take then ya it's good.
1213,It's gut wrenching
1214,"It‚Äôs really not a good movie. I love me some low budget melodrama, but this was a pretentious pile of fluff. Legit one of my biggest disappointments for a movie after being told by reddit it‚Äôs good."
1215,"Oh, I was under the impression The Old Man and the Gun was also serious. Still need to see it"
1216,"I love how that short preview shows everything while telling nothing, its gonna be great!"
1217,"And Dunkirk! Smaller role, but I still thought he was good in it."
1218,"After looking at the high res, I will concede that it just isn't easy to read, but also it does look fantastic aesthetically the way it is."
1219,"Yes, but you'll be more likely to remember the tagline now after having put in the effort to read it. This coming from a death metal fan who discerns band logos as a lazy afternoon pastime."
1220,It's not bad. It's meant to be that way.
1221,Yeah but it's a great way for someone to stop and stare at your poster for a bit. It's a visually striking poster and the tagline is interesting so I'd want to watch a movie like that.
1222,The Yeez Knight.
1223,Yes but he has to play a flute-sword to wake it up.  And do a dance with a lot of high-stepping.
1224,"""I'm guessing that it will have a fair mix of both grittiness and religious subject matter. We'll see.""  I agree, maybe it'll be worth seeing after the trailer.

But I have to point out that while I have a problem with the religious aspects, which is purely personal, and you reply that ""to my knowledge religion is still a major factor in medieval literature and the period itself"" While other downvoted posts in this thread talk about it not being historically accurate and people reply to that with its a FABLE so it doesn't NEED to be historically accurate.. Jumping through hoops and double standards man...  Funny"
1225,"No, but the time period was, and you know what I mean (I hope). üòè"
1226,"Also, Genghis Khan was an actual person. This is based on a poem."
1227,"Again, if you would live out of the first world countries you would see it is exactly the same, and that is what I am trying to explain too. We don‚Äôt need white saviours, we need our minirity people to stop invading and trying to replace white people‚Äôs stories because it comes with the same backslash and looks as ridiculous as that John Wayne situation. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

1229,"He's upset that white people are ""disappearing"""
1230,"> after being told by reddit it‚Äôs good.

It is perfectly fine if you didn't like it.  [But it was not just reddit saying it was a good movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Ghost_Story#Critical_response)"
1231,Strangely enough. I would describe it as wholesome
1232,It kind of is? Definitely not a comedy but it‚Äôs not dark/gritty.
1233,"It kinda falls into the dramedy category. Not a straight comedy by any means, but definitely has some funny moments."
1234,Yeah as everyone else said it's certainly not an outright comedy but it's a completely different tone compared to A Ghost Story.
1235,Yeah really liked him in Dunkirk! He's amazing in an Irish film called Mammal too though the film is pretty bleak.
1236,I think it's just the letter 'e' needs to be a tad more distinctive and it would be ok.
1237,Kanye is King
1238,"Haha, yeah like I said I haven't ever read it and am not personally that familiar with it, so I don't know how heavily religion is portrayed in that story. I'm just aware of how important of a factor it played in everyday life at the time, but fables certainly don't always dive into that sort of thing."
1239,What year does Gawain and the Green Knight take place in?
1240,There will be a greenskinned man who survives decapitation in this film
1241,"That won't stop these people.

""Nuh UH, Sir Gawain was WHITE and PROUD"""
1242,">Brexit is a reality.

Please keep touting the global embarassment that is Brexit as a victory. 

Its wildly entertaining to hear you be so proud of when the UK announced they were going to drop their pants and shit themselves and then took 4 years to actually do it."

1244,"Buddy, I‚Äôm mexican, this is not a racist thing, it just can‚Äôt be. 

I am speaking as a minority that wants this crap to stop and want people to embrace their own cultural and diverse background and leave stories that belong to other people alone. Dev Patel does not need to replace white characters to be good, accepting it is accepting that only stories foreign to his heritage are good, it looks as ridiculous as The Rock as Hercules you know? üòè"
1245,"In my case it has nothing to do with white and proud, it just cannot be about it you know? üòÜ

It has to do with not being utterly stupid. 

And why is Dev Patel so interested in white roles and not in indian roles anymore coming from an extremely rich and diverse cultural background? 
India has a very big (and bad) history of caring too much about not being as white as they would love to, skin tone is extremely important for them, I know about it, I lived with an indian woman. This is just another consequence of the invasion they suffered, trying to culturally replace the oppresor, to get some payback, and it is dead wrong, it makes things worse. To each its own.

So what now? Since I do not agree with your crusade are you guys going to start educating the ignorant mexican that lives south of the border? 
Because only white boys know what is politically correct right my saviors? Typical white boys. Just fucking typical. üòè"
1246,"I don‚Äôt care, I am not british, in fact, I belong to a minority, you would be surprised to know which one, and still I am against cross-cultural replacements because they create an awkward and uncomfortable feeling that ends in those racial responses, and anyway, the world is so rich, Dev Patel‚Äôs culture is SO vast and big that even I can imagine millions of ways to put him in an amazing movie without insulting him with ‚Äúreverse-white washing‚Äù techniques and without trying to be ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù without looking just polemical, but ok, people don‚Äôt seem to get it for some reason."
1247,"I mean, Mexicans can be racist. 

Gawin is not a white character. He is a fictional character. He's not an Anglo character, he's a mythical character. He's maybe an English character, but so is Dev. But Gawin has no placement in any kind of history or real racial group. He's a myth. 

And of course Dev doesn't need this role to be good. He is good, which is how he got this role. 

The Rock as Hercules would be awesome. Heck, I can't imagine why it would possibly matter to have a Greek God have slightly brown skin. This is silly."
1248,">without insulting him

Now you're tripping over yourself trying to backpedal, trying to tell me that you were ACKSHUALLY worried about Patel the whole time.

Dude, the number of people you're fooling with that is less than zero.

>I don‚Äôt care, I am not british

And yet the inexplicable focus on Brexit. If I look in your post history, I bet I'd find shit about the ""GrEAt RePlACeMenT"" too."

Let‚Äôs just educate those bad and ignorant mexican racist bigots!"

You most probably are a white knight fighting for the good causes (typical anglo), a Kevin Costner in Dances With Wolves, well I am not, I don‚Äôt have that privilege and I am not crying about it or pretending to have an open mind. There is just no way I can be racist because racism has been directed towards me my whole life, something that, if we are assuming like you did, most probably has not happened to you at all. I am the minority here and I am explaining why these things are just nocive.

What I am saying is something most people around the world realize, if you would live in the third world you would see it, no one wants to see this ‚Äúpolemical‚Äù things, because they do not make any sense (they really don‚Äôt and here we just laugh at american things like this and just say ‚Äúah estos gringos con sus mamadas de nuevo‚Äù) and they do make things worse in white countries, and if you do not believe me then look at the box office numbers for ‚Äúwoke‚Äù content. Numbers don‚Äôt lie. You guys really don‚Äôt understand do you?"

1253,Yes! Loved George McKay in ‚Äò1917‚Äô. ‚Äò1917‚Äô will do so much for the careers of him and his co-star Dean-Charles Chapman.
1254,She really impressed me in The King. Looking forward to see what she does next.

1261,I turned the tv on saw a movie was about to start. Russell Crowe appeared almost immediately and I thought ‚Äúoh is this Noah? Maybe I‚Äôll watch it‚Äù. And it just got weirder and weirder and I was just baffled trying to figure out what kind of interpretation of Noah‚Äôs Ark this is. About 20 minutes in I realized I was watching Man of Steel.
1262,"Back in the early days of YouTube, before the lawyers descended, people would upload entire movies in 10 minute chunks cause that was the limit at the time. I remember watching Predator that way and my wife was like ""don't you have that on DVD?"" I was like ""yeah but it's on YouTube."""

1267,Obligatory ‚Äúnot a movie but‚Äù I did once leave the theatre at a play‚Äôs interval thinking that it was over. Turns out that plays aren‚Äôt typically 90 minutes long.
1268,I forgot to turn on subtitles when I watched District 9 so I had no idea what any of the aliens were saying for the entire movie. Still really enjoyed it though.
1269,Started half way? how? Did the file come in two parts? Did the disc launch at the middle?
1270,"I watched possession with it shutting off every 10 minutes after the halfway mark because the file was corrupted or something. 

It was aids to power on through but I did it."
1271,"Not a movie, but I started season 2 of Marvelous Mrs. Maisel thinking it was the first season, and I just assumed in started in the middle of the story due to the flashbacks in S2E1. Got about halfway through S2E2 until I felt like something was definitely off."
1272,"Downloaded an Estonian film and the subtitles didn't work. Watched it anyway with zero idea what was happening.

Also a few times if I'm reaaally not feeling a movie, I'll speed it up on VLC because I'm too stubborn to just bail on it. Actually maybe that's more of a pro tip"
1273,"When I first signed up for Netflix, when it was just a DVD service, I requested The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2. I quickly devoured and loved the first one, so I went to put in the second and realized that Netflix had only sent me the second disc. So I figured ""oh well I'll just stream the first half of the movie"" and I quickly noticed that none of the Vito sections were subtitled. I figured that it was like the restaurant scene in the first movie where you're supposed to be able to follow what's going on just based on facial expressions and visual context, and I spent about 2 hours resenting the movie because I had no idea what was happening, until I swapped to the DVD and saw subtitles for all the remaining Vito sections. 

So I guess the short version would be that I spent most of the runtime of one of the greatest movies ever made hating the movie because I chose a bad online stream."

1277,"I‚Äôve got an hilarious high school story about this. Me and two pals got talked into watching a movie on edibles called Adaption with Nicholas cage about a police man fighting internally with his disassociating other personality, the duality of the human spirit. 

It was a surrealistic study into absurd mental decline... we thought. 

Until we honestly realized we were fucking high morons and it was about two twins where one is just an asshole and how it kinda escalates regarding that."
1278,I think 2 or 3 times I've started watching either Jupiter Ascending or Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets thinking I've seen the other one but not entirely sure which one I've seen. I've definitely seen both but I kept forgetting if I've actually seen one or the other.
1279,"Huge fan of half baked. First decade or so that I was watching it, I was watching a VHS copy I taped off of comedy Central. All those years I really believed thurgood said, ""what's that stuff?

1281,"There's apparently a Disney+ bug some people have experienced that set default language to Dutch or something else non-English.

1282,"not a movie but my wife and I watched the last episode of Westworld. Waited for every show to air so we could binge. So I'm confused on what's going on. She's confused on what's going on and I say to her,""Ya, but you know this show is weird. We'll figure it out."" Previously she had stated she thought we fucked up but I would not be swayed."
1283,My family and I watched side 2 of the Amedeus dvd first. Still dont know how none of us figured it out until the end but I was young so that's my excuse.
1284,"I watched a movie on Netflix (Take Me to the River, I recommend it), and the aspect ratio is 2.35 : 1. When I watched it, I had not seen any trailers or knew that was the ratio, and when it started, I was instantly taken aback because the bottom black bar was about 50% taller than the top one. Logically I thought ""something's wrong here"", but after a minute, I was kinda into it and thought this must be an intended artistic choice since Netflix has never messed up for me in any way like that, and I just watched the rest. Nope, randomly watched the trailer sometime later, and it was simply 2.35. Went back to start it again on Netflix and it was normal like in the trailer. Felt like an idiot. At least I didn't miss anything, the frame wasn't actually being covered, it was just higher up on my television. Very odd. Now I'm wondering if a film has ever been purposely presented/framed like that for whatever reason."
1285,"Back in the day, I rented Stephen King‚Äôs IT double VHS. And, someone didn‚Äôt put the tapes back correctly, so I watched part 2 before part 1. Thought ‚Äúwell, that was a fine ending, what could possibly be on tape 1?‚Äù üôÉ"
1286,"Had to watch a foreign movie in class with subtitles in a different language than the film, so that was zero help."
1287,"On New Year's Eve, my friends and I watched a bootleg version of the new *Cats.* Honestly, the blurring and multilingual gambling ads were a big improvement."
1288,I watched Dunkirk after barely sleeping for 2 days. That movie is supposed to be gripping and immersive. I slept through half of it.
1289,"I once watched a thematically accurate version of Captain Philips that was missing the Somali-to-English subtitles. At first I thought it was an incredibly bold creative choice, to keep the audience as nervous and in the dark as the ship passengers, but after it went on for like 5-10 minutes with no Americans in the scene I knew something was amiss."

1292,I watched Interstellar but not in theatres.
1293,"Not me, but my mom once watched Fight Club and turned it off with 20 or so minutes remaining. She said ""I don't get what the big deal is, this movie is dumb""

Movie stupidity runs in the family though. When I was a teenager, I watched Seven for the first time. I'd gotten it on DVD, and about halfway through I got a little bored and started reading the titles of the DVD chapters. One of them, near the end, was titled 'Her Pretty Head.' Needless to say, all surprise was nixed.


Oh also when I was a kid I went to see the Lion King and went to the bathroom during the scene when Mufasa got trampled. When I came back, Simba was just staggering around in the desert. I asked my mom what happened while I was gone but she didn't answer. So the rest of that movie was confusing as hell."
1294,"As David Lynch once said ""It's fucking stupid that you can watch a movie on a cellphone"". So I think that all the times I've watched good movies on my phone was stupid."

Then looked at everyone else there and realized I was the only one with 3D glasses. I had the lame privilege of watching those kids getting to the park twice."
1297,"I once decided that i have to watch The Godfather. I saw an hour and a half without understanding anything an then realized i was watching The Godfather III. I started the first film right away and didnt enjoy it because 3 and a half hours of Godfather in a row was a bit too much for me.
 To this day I'm scared to try again."

One night my dog had to go out to pee while I was watching Jacob's Ladder. I didn't want to stop the movie, so I copied the file over to the Zen, and head out the door.

It's after midnight and I'm standing outside in the pitch dark, and I get so engrossed in the movie that I forget that it's after midnight and I'm standing outside in the pitch dark.

I just about had a heart attack once I looked up and realized where I was."

1315,"I watched a bootleg of John Carter that didn‚Äôt have subtitles for all the martian dialog. It was *great* and I recommmend it to everyone. It makes the movie better, knowing as much or as little as John Carter does."
1316,Wait...you thought that Donald's screenplay was the plot of the movie?
1317,"I had a kid a few years ago and have since seen dozens of movies on my cell phone, grabbing time whenever I can. Absolutely nothing wrong with it."
1318,If you hold it right up to your face it's almost like you're at the theater.

1332,"2003 was an amazing year for me as a fan of  films, Thanks in no small part to working at a little place called Blockbuster and a filmmaker named Park Chan wook and his movie *Oldboy*. I quickly found a copy of *Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance* and knew I had found something special. Not long after I found myself loving *Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring*, and then *Tale of Two Sisters*. A new world of unique perspective and tales of the human condition were suddenly opened up to me, and I've been in love ever since.

I was really excited to see Bong and Korean cinema get some mainstream/hollywood recognition and to see this ""new world"" of storytelling be opened up to so many more lovers of film. I've been a fan since *the Host* which I find to be an amazing time and a lovely take on the monster genre. And *Parasite* truly is an amazing film and deserves recognition on the world stage."
1333,"I can‚Äôt believe there is no mention of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon on this post."
1334,"The list above is specifically from 2003. 

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was released in 2000, along with Battle Royale, In the Mood for Love, Yi Yi, and JSA. A really strong year for Asian cinema, but based on fewer titles."
1335,"It's not a horror film. It's a sometimes horrifying film, but it's fully a revenge thriller."
1336,"It‚Äôs definitely more along the seven and silence of the lambs thriller type then jumpy traditional horror.

1338,"Oldboy is a straight thriller, it's very very violent but it never tips into horror."
1339,"You‚Äôre good to go.
It‚Äôs a ‚Äúmindfuck thriller‚Äù in my opinion and has no horror at all, just some probable shock value here and there."
1340,"It's not a horror film at all.

It's just an extremely harrowing, extremely disturbing thriller that has some pretty horrific themes thrown in. Think a super r-rated revenge film with some amazing action sequences and some truly wonderful twists."
1341,"It‚Äôs really not a horror at all. More like a very tense thriller/mystery, so I think your dad would enjoy it"
1342,It‚Äôs just extremely violent and graphic.  Brutal. A fun viewing.
1343,"I would say it's definitely not a a horror movie.

It's more of a psychological thriller akin to Silence of the Lambs."
1344,"It's not horror.

>The two of us have watched and both enjoyed things like Seven, The Silence of the Lambs, Saw, and Zodiac.

Based on those, you and your dad gonna enjoy Oldboy too."
1345,It‚Äôs not horror but it can be graphic like horror films.
1346,Thanks for the help everyone. This is basically what I was expecting. Looking forward to checking it out.

1352,"I‚Äôve said this 100 times and it‚Äôs often overlooked.  Cameron construction of the screenplay is brilliant.  To use modern research hunters showing the audience how it sank before it happened in the movie was great storytelling.

Furthermore no other filmmaker on the planet could‚Äôve made this movie."
1353,"I would take out ‚Äúsome other adjectives that I can‚Äôt think of‚Äù for starters.

‚ÄúThe ginormous Titanic, the seamless CGI shots of the Titanic‚Äù: I would use a different adjective than ‚Äúginormous‚Äù and instead of the second ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù I would say ship, things like that would improve how it comes across. You could say something like ‚Äúyou feel the breathtaking size of the ship and the seamless CGI creates an incredibly realistic experience‚Äù just as one example. 

Your enthusiasm for the film comes across which is great."
1354,What do you guys think of my review? Open to any criticism to improve.
1355,"Don't use words like 'ginormous' and 'iffy'. Also try to stay away from adverbs, it's lazy writing when overdone. And ' the single most infamous tragedy of humankind' is hyperbolic. How about the holocaust?"
1356,"Letterboxd has been my go to for years now. It‚Äôs pretty incredible how easy it is to find cool films from browsing lists, by genre, by decade, by year etc.

Only thing that I don‚Äôt like about it is the vocal tumblresque community. At least they stay away from older films for the most part.

Edit: Also, If you get pro you get a snazzy [stats page](https://letterboxd.com/cymro2011/stats/), which I really dig. Kinda encouraged me to get into older films to balance out the 'By Release Year' bar and recently, watch stuff from different countries to fill in the world map."
1357,None.
1358,Imdb but I adjust them for the type of movie and how long it has been out. I'll watch a six in genres Im a big fan of  but need higher for others. New films ratings tend to be higher than equivalent older ones
1359,"Metacritic. I prefer their method of ""rate it from 1 to 100"" rather than RT's ""Do you approve or not?"""
1360,"I typically don't use any ratings site. I'll just watch teaser, trailer, & final trailers to get a idea if I want to see it or not. Not by someone else's biased point of view."
1361,"I follow 2 critics I like and understand, so none I guess."
1362,"> Like everyone else I always check a movie rating before deciding whether to spend the next 2 hours watching it or not.

Not everyone else but some and some only use those sites occasionally. I don't check them at all. For examples my sources or tools are:

* written articles

* top lists such as TSPDT, Sight & Sound, AFI, Roger Ebert's great movies list

* director's body of work (if large I narrow it down first using online sources)

* certain critics' highly rated films

* Youtube videos such as Cinefix top videos and Mark Kermode's best of the year videos

* word of mouth (friends or people online)

* festival winners

* Oscar winners (best picture, cinematography, foreign)

It doesn't take much convincing for to want to see a film if the source is a good one. After I've decided to watch a film (and added it on my watchlist) I avoid trailers, conversations, articles, etc. until I've watched it."
1363,"I don‚Äôt 

Edit: actually I do add films with high Letterboxd ratings on watchlist. Don‚Äôt go with IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes.

IMDB is so hugely effected by recency bias and the ratings seem to be very heavily skewed by popularity.

Rotten Tomatoes is the worst, if 100% of the critics give a film more than a 5/10 then it will have 100% on The tomato meter even if no one gives it a 10/10."
1364,Dvdsavant is a good one
1365,">""Imo IMDB > RT & the others because of the sheer number of audience reviews instead of solely hardcore critics but I don't know really.""

I use both IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. IMDb to get an idea of how enjoyable film is, IMDb reviews and Rotten Tomatoes to get an idea on whether it has something unique to it and what film's strong suits are (you can see from the summary and the snippets how film is praised).

>""Not sure about the biased part though, why would the average joe leaving a simple review or rating on imdb be affected by bias?""

IMDb ratings come from people that use IMDb, and some people use it more than others. For example, there are more folks aged 18-29 than 30-44 (more than twice) and there are twice more males. Those inequalities definitely affect the scores, e.g., people find different things interesting at different ages. Some films will be overrated, some underrated.

Also, IMDb scale is to measure some overall satisfaction with the film, but a lot of artistic and art-house films are notable not because they are overall great but because they are different kind of cinema itself, or different kind of storytelling, or different kind of cinematography, etc. It may have some 6.8/10 IMDb rating and you'll say to yourself 'not bad but nothing special, and premise is so-so, I can find something better' - when in fact that film is unlike anything else you'll ever see. Those kinds of films you're more likely to spot using RT Tomatometer or individual reviews (including IMDb reviews)."
1366,"For new movies I just find someone on youtube who has the same general tastes as I do. Even professional critics will have a natural bias. Chris Stuckmann and Jeremy Jahns are usually pretty on point with their reviews and are both good at avoid spoilers. 

For older movies I tend to use IMDB since it generally has a higher amount of separate ratings. Especially for super obscure movies, a lot of crappier movies have high ratings on RT because the 3 people who rated it are doing so because they specifically sought out that movie. In general which ever website has the highest voting population will be the best to go with.

For me I generally don't watch anything rated under a 6 on IMDB. Then if it is rated 6 I only watch if it is relatively short (a crap 90 minute movie is better than a crap 180 minute movie) or if it something I really want to watch."
1367,IMDB usually. I'll read through a number of users reviews and see what the consensus is. Wish I'd checked Jay and Silent Bob Reboot before watching it on sentiment and nostalgia alone üòÇüòÇ
1368,"General > IMDb

Less mainstream > used to check MUBI and Fandor

See the ratings to map my expectation."
1369,"Fandango usually has the RT score and an audience score side by side. I'll check those ratings before deciding whether to see a movie in theaters or not. If I'm just streaming something at home I'll usually just go by the trailer, but if I'm still unsure then I'll use IMDB"
1370,"I look at IMDB which has the meta score on the same page, so that way I see what the general audience thinks as well as the critics. But at the same time, if I want to watch a movie and it interests me, I‚Äôll watch it anyway and make my own mind up about. Ratings and reviews can just help when I‚Äôm not sure about a particular movie."
1371,"Filmweb and RT.

Filmweb tends to have lower ratings than Imdb, which sives out fanboy ratings. They also added separate viewers general ratings and critics general ratings, also allowing you to see which critic gave it a specific grade, which is a great feature. *(sometimes I do compare Filmweb ratings with Imdb though, when I suspect they're too low, like in case of ""Hot Girls Wanted"" and ""Snowpiercer"".)*

I check RT for critics and it helps me judge how well made a movie is, so I can fully appreciate it."
1372,I just wait for Half in the Bag reveiws
1373,"I dont, I just log onto Troma Now and look for something I havent seen yet."
1374,IMDB but it doesn't decide if I will watch a film or not unless it's horribly bad and also not my type of film.
1375,"I look at a few facts like who made the movie, where it is from, running time, etc. I then go to rotten tomatoes and read the reviewer comments (both good and bad). Sometimes I get it from external sources like fresh air on NPR (i.e. that turned me onto Parasite)"
1376,"If it's a movie I'm not hyped for and I need to pick between a few, I'll glance at Rotten Tomatoes audience score, nothing more and go from there. If it's at home and not a theater, I'll pick whichever has the lowest run time cause free time is non existent in my life now."
1377,"For new releases:

Trailer usually comes first, followed by IMDB for films that have just released to get a general idea. Then perhaps a few reviews if I need to see justification for why a movie is rated particularly low (say below 7 if I expected it higher).

If a film is rated decent and above (say 7 or higher) I'll generally try and make time to see it at the cinema. Exceptions are movies with particular actors or themes I like and will see regardless of score.

I use RT additionally if it's not an obvious decision.

I have a rough idea in my head what I expect each movie's score to be and work around that."
1378,"[Filmaffinity](https://www.filmaffinity.com/) is my go to site. I always find IMDB scores swollen and this site use to have more accure ones. It started in spanish but now it has full english support. I really recommend it.

Also it has a soulmate thing where you can find people with similar scores and that's a fantastic way to find movies that people with similar taste like."
1379,none
1380,Rt and flixter
1381,I don‚Äôt use ratings. I just go on JustWatch to see what movies are available
1382,"I follow a couple different reviewers on YouTube as well as 4 pop culture/film-based podcasts; however almost all of those people are American, Canadian or British so there are some movies, usually European ones, they never see or review that come out in Spain where I live. As such, I also check out Rotten Tomatoes and I always read the highlighted comments or I look for critics I know from places like The AV Club. I might be weird because I usually focus on reading the negative reviews if it's a movie I know nothing about (I do the same on Goodreads) because there are things that some people will have issues with that I won't and other things that some people have no problem watching that will bother me. I like checking lots of different sources because everyone is bringing different viewpoints and backgrounds to their viewing habits. I recently joined Letterboxd too and I'm kind of obsessed. 

If it's a movie I'm very excited for, I'll just go see it though and will usually avoid reviews until after I've seen the movie. 

There is no reviewer or critic whose impressions line up perfectly with mine, ha, but I put a lot of stock in the opinions of Dan Murrell and Roth Cornet from Screen Junkies. I think they give things a fair shake and they spend a fair amount of time explaining their thoughts which I appreciate. If they say a movie is worthwhile, I'll probably at least give it a try. That's how I ended up seeing Jojo Rabbit (a movie I was pretty iffy on based on the premise) and 1917 (I can count on one hand the number of war movies I've seen) and I liked Jojo and LOVED 1917. It's not perfect - I couldn't get into Dolemite is my Name - but nothing is."
1383,Imdb
1384,A don‚Äôt read reviews watch it decide yer self most reviewers know fuck aw
1385,Any rating that isn‚Äôt an online audience score.
1386,"They did start out pretty decent, but the subculture spawned of trying to outwit each other is rather appalling."
1387,">the vocal tumblresque community   

I've never been on Tumblr, what does that mean? Do you have an example?"
1388,So where do you find films to watch?
1389,"Fair point, I respect that. Not sure about the biased part though, why would the average joe leaving a simple review or rating on imdb be affected by bias?"
1390,"I agree with your sentiment on Rotten Tomatoes, the binary rating scheme is pretty horrible."
1391,"Ouch thats rough haha, unlucky man."
1392,IMDb has an issue with movies starring black people
1393,"Kinda hard to put into words but I guess I can boil it down to there being a lot of obnoxious personalities and a few too many 'woke' feminists for my liking. They're not a big group of letterboxd users but they are very vocal.

Maybe the 5 star reviews of [Ghostbusters 2016](https://letterboxd.com/film/ghostbusters-2016/reviews/by/entry-rating/) will shed some light on what I mean."
1394,You can find movies very easily without looking up reviews
1395,"Netflix, shops, trailers/adverts, other people/word of mouth, if I like an actor I'll usually try another one of their films, directors are similar though I know less directors, book to film adaptations

Point is I've seen a lot of films and have never really looked at rating sites before watching. Its more fun to do it afterwards imo"
1396,"I look at what's in the theaters, read what the movie is about, cast etc.

But I don't check sites like rotten tomatoes etc. They're just like Amazon reviews."
1397,"Well their point will be biased no matter what. It is their opinion on the movie, and shouldn't sway me one way or the other from my opinion on seeing the movie or not."
1398,uh can you expand on that?
1399,"Yup, as soon as there is a specific online activist community who feels strongly about a film, the IMDB score becomes meaningless."
1400,I totally agree. Generally these are the highest rated reviews right? Thats the only thing I don't like about the app. I wish I could always sort reviews by recent on mobile.
1401,"I know, I'm just curious about where they find films to watch."
1402,"Ah yeah aha didn't think of it like that, fair enough man."
1403,">highest rated reviews right?

yeah

on the app it sorts by review popularity by default and then you can sort by most recent if you click the settings on the top right. It is a pain having to do it every time though."
1404,At the local cinema/streaming service of choice.
1405,La Isla Minima (Marsh Land) is a decent detective/procedural thriller.
1406,I enjoyed Toc Toc.
1407,I quite liked ‚ÄúThe Invisible Guest‚Äù [2016]
1408,"Any film by the director √Ålex de la Iglesia.  The last films of him, ""El Bar"" and ""Perfectos desconocidos"" are very good."
1409,Not sure quite how old it is but the movie The Fury of A Patient Man is excellent and reasonably recent
1410,Amores Perros.. it's much older. But still a great movie
1411,"Not from the last two years, but have you seen El Metodo? (The Method).

Amazing contained character film that all takes place during a group interview for a job."
1412,"Qui√©n a hierro mata. ""Eye for an eye"" it's a good drug Thriller."
1413,"In the great category there is **El Reino** by *Rodrigo Sorogoyen*. It's a political thriller, but a particularly well made one. The art of tension is mastered, so many scenes are ambitious and work perfectly, the powerful performance of *Antonio de la Torre* was more than convincing, it perfectly knows what it tries to tell and what it has to tell, it's not the greatest movie ever but it's damn good. 


*Rodrigo Sorogoyen* made also **Que Dios Nos Perdone**, which I haven't seen yet but seems to be as good as **El Reino**. 

I've heard good thing about the animated **Bu√±uel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles**. 

**Everybody Knows** is quite nice and has a great lead. 

(And you can check the Goya maybe)"
1414,Mirage. If you're into sci-fi dramas like looper or predestination.
1415,It's from 2012 but I really liked Mientras Duermes.  Also Relatos Salvajes (2015) was an interesting and funny black comedy.
1416,"I usually struggle to get into Spanish comedies but I liked Kiki El Amor Se Hace which is a sex comedy but the humour isn't raunchy in the way that US comedies are. It's about 5-6 people who are turned on by paraphilias but not the illegal kinds. 

+1 for Perfectos Desconocidos. 

I also just asked my colleagues and they said to check out movies by Am√©nabar"
1417,Pain and glory 2019 staring Antonio banderas. Was nominated for best foreign film this year. It's pretty good.
1418,"I loved his las brujas de zugarrumundi, it's one of my favorites horror comedies of the last years"
1419,"Excellent film, but Mexican."
1420,"yup, Banderas is fantastic in this. and Almodovar‚Äôs use of color is beautiful"
1421,"With such a varied filmography with this to the The Good, The Bad, The Weird (wacky Western), I Saw The Devil (grim serial killer revenge thriller), to The Age of Shadows (espionage thriller), Kim Jee Woon has certainly emerged as one of the most interesting action film directors in Asia. It's a shame that his sole Hollywood effort (The Last Stand) turned out to be so rote, though not by his choice I presume."
1422,"I love how different his filmography is, he basically tried every genre apart from sci fi (horror, noir, black comedy, western, thriller, action, drama) and always succeded to me. His The Last Stand is by far his worst movie but it was really fun to me and not that bad."
1423,I'm still mad about what he did to Jin Roh. Still a big fan of his other films though.
1424,Didnt he do the good the bad and the weird?
1425,Yes he did :) it's one of my favorite westerns of that decade
1426,"Yeah great film, I watch a bittersweet life straight after the vengeance trilogy, boy was I on a roll"
1427,"Bittersweet Life it's still one of my favourite movies of all time, love that movie so much. Also his A Tale of Two Sisters is one my favorites horrors, along with The Innocents and The Exorcist. One of the few movies that properly scares the fuck out of me when I watched it lol"
1428,no plot details yet but it'll be set in Iran.
1429,"One of my favourite directors. *A Separation* , *The Salesman* ,  *About Elly* and *The Past* are all must sees."
1430,"""A Separation"" should have been the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture award for 2011. It's brilliantly-written and the acting was superb."
1431,"TBF with Kiarostami having passed and Panahi being dogged by the Iranian government, Farhadi has zero competition in getting his films into the Oscars. I do think that Cannes made a mistake by giving Loach a second Palme instead of awarding a film like The Salesman top prize."
1432,Let's hope this one is in American language.
1433,Farhadi films almost always have intense climaxes but The Salesman‚Äôs is insane.
1434,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and definitely the best I've seen from after the turn of the century. I haven't seen it again for maybe two years but I still think about it every now and then. Its empathy is stupefying."
1435,"The jury made a mistake with not awarding Toni Erdmann, Elle, or Paterson the top prize at Cannes"
1436,Kiarostami's movies were never Oscar material. so there wasn't any competition to begin with.
1437,Right? He's amazing at heightening social drama to near thriller like proportions.
1438,"I would have been happy with Aquarius, The Salesman, or The Handmaiden. I would venture to say that most people think I, Daniel Blake was a head scratcher."
1439,Yeah that and Dolan's movie getting second place were pretty bad choices.
1440,defitnly not give the prize to The handmaiden was a theft. And it wasn't even nominated.
1441,"Considering the ""twist"" in the first movie, are they just going in a different direction?"
1442,2 Brahms 2 Calm
1443,The 2nd Boy
1444,"I won the first movie on blu-ray from a mod contest here on /r/movies. That said, any person that allows their kid to dig up a creepy doll and keep it around is not a fit parent and deserves whatever supernatural fate is heading their way."
1445,They are hiding inside the doll now
1446,[Boy 2 special TV spot] (https://www.facebook.com/spongebob/videos/remember-when-smitty-werben-man-jensen/258359111376662/)
1447,"He was in Star is Born, wasn‚Äôt that a dramatic role?"
1448,You really bowled us over with that pitch
1449,Reminds me of St. Vincent starring Bill Murray.
1450,Never saw it. Got it confused with silver linings playbook. Aint talking about shit like that. Real griddy stuff.
1451,I lose sleep at night thinking about dialogue.
1452,That's what I was thinking!
1453,All you‚Äôre talking is shit. And it‚Äôs ‚Äúgritty‚Äù.
1454,Who the fuck you wanna be? You wanna be you? Or you wanna be me? Look what I have going on. Sure I'm paying bills. but I'm surving.
1455,It's the exact same premise. Not discrediting OPs dreams though I love Chappelle and agree that he would kill a dramatic role.  Get Dave in the next Safdie bros. movie.
1456,"im not talking shit, and thanks for the correction. gritty and griddy sound alike. Sorry you think im talking shit, I dont mean to."
1457,You better get your ass out there William!
1458,Definitely checking this out!
1459,Hell yeah!
1460,"Thanks a lot, will check it out tonight."
1461,Sounds like earth vs spider 2001 sci-fi horror.
1462,Earth vs the spider
1463,"Yes, that's it! Thanks a lot! You guys are good. lol"
1464,Yup! Thanks!
1465,My take is that she has manic schizophrenia and the films narrative tries to accurately portray it
1466,"Well, those aliens can move them throught time. Why would they? I don't know."
1467,"The movie wants you to go back and forth wondering if the main character is dealing with mental illness, or real and bizarre events happening, or going crazy because of said events. 

I guess ultimately they want you to believe it was real, because another character saw the horse in the beginning, when it could have just as easily been the main character who looked up, in which case by the end the uncertainty would have remained."
1468,"""Money Heist""

I know it's a tv show and I've actually heard good things about it but the title is just so terrible I can't bring myself to click it on Netflix."
1469,I remember when I was a kid I used to think xXx was a porno since that's all that came up when googling it.
1470,"Midnight Meat Train destroyed itself with its title. 

It's based on a Clive Barker short story of the same name, and the film is genuinely fun, gruesome, and horrific. However, Barker wouldn't allow them to change the title, and audiences understandably stayed far away from it upon its release. I'll never forget seeing the trailer for the first time in the theater... the place went quiet, people were absorbed, a few folks even screamed -- then the title card hit and everybody just lost it laughing."
1471,Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. Dear god that‚Äôs a dull movie title.
1472,"John Carter.

It's way too normal sounding a name for a film that is a crazy sci fi fantasy adventure. No kid will hear the name John Carter and want to see the film. 

Even the book it was based on was called ""A Princess of Mars"". Why they felt the need to change the name into something more basic and boring sounding, i have no clue."
1473,Took me a while to get around to watching Good Will Hunting cause the title sounded like wordsalad.
1474,"Fant4stic. It‚Äôs just such stupid design choice. I get it a 4 kind looks like an upper case A. But still, I saw that and immediately knew the film would be shit.

(I know it‚Äôs still just Fantastic 4, but the design choice is just so atrocious that this movie will always be Fant4stic to me)"
1475,"As a kid I repeatedly had *The Princess Bride* recommended to me, but scoffed because I was an 8 year old boy and the only word in that title that didn't sound awful was ""The"".

Needless to say it's one of my favorite movies ever."
1476,Dredd was marketed as Dredd 3D and the trailers made it look like cheap trash. I only checked it out because I saw it was getting good reviews. Glad I did!
1477,"One rather famous example; one of the reasons ""The Shawshank Redemption"" didn't do well upon first release was because of that unwieldy title. And said title was already condensed from the novella, which was originally ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption."""
1478,"The change from the cool and original ""Pacific Rim: Maelstrom"" to the horrible and unoriginal ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" ruined my faith in that movie.  And it ended up being bad so maybe it deserved that title."
1479,The Constant Gardener
1480,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World has a way too long title, been in my watchlist for seven years."
1481,"Rise of Skywalker, I didnt like the idea of the use of someone's name in the title. Empire Strikes Back, Phantom Menace, Revenge of the Sith, cool title names. Rise of Skywalker? Its like episode 1: Origin of Vader. Episode 3: Kenobi high grounds or episode 5: Luke's family reunion"
1482,"The Princess Bride probably, to me at least. I need to see it soon though"
1483,"I found Reservoir Dogs to be an odd title, but I enjoyed the movie."
1484,"The Sun is Also a Star (2019)- Whenever I saw the trailer, which is a a lot because it seemed to be in front of EVERY movie I saw for a year, I found the title to be needlessly wordy and pretentious for appeared to be just another romance movie."
1485,"Rise of the Gaurdians picked literally the most generic title it could‚Äôve. Disappointing, since the movie itself is decent now that I‚Äôve watched it."
1486,"Probably Baby Driver, for a long time I thought it was some movie for kids."
1487,"Sex Lives Of The Potato Men

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368259/

Mackenzie Crook was famous from The Office (UK) at the time, and Johnny Vegas is funny, but... Nah."
1488,"Mystic Pizza, dafuq?"
1489,Motherless Brooklyn. What the fuck does that even mean? I know that's the name o the book but it's not unusual for the film to change the title.
1490,Still haven't seen Snakes on a Plane.
1491,"American beauty, but I was so, so wrong.


Opposite scenario; Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, knowing Jim Carey was in it, had it been called something else there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm watching that movie, but it was freaking amazing."
1492,"Yes, a recent example, Birds of Prey: having the word ""fantabulous"" in the title is screaming at me ""THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU"". That is not necessarily a bad thing, movies can have different target audiences and it's likely I wouldn't have seen that one even with a different title, as soon as I saw in the poster that Cassandra Cain looked like a character from a Disney Channel sitcom. What beats me is why they decided to make it R-rated while they target tween girls."
1493,"""Don't Fuck With Cats"" on Netflix is the most recent example."
1494,"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). Sadly, Heath Ledger's final movie, and I will never see it because of the achingly pretentious title. It wouldn't be so bad if The Simpsons hadn't spoofed movies like this with fictional washed-up actor Troy McClure's doomed vanity project [The Contabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/The_Contrabulous_Fabtraption_of_Professor_Horatio_Hufnagel) Eerily, the Simpsons episode preceded ""Imaginarium"" by over a decade: I think they were primarily spoofing The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. There is something about these twee little movies that attracts actors that should know better like moths to a candle.

Ten years later I watched Zero Theorem, and despite the cooler title, I think it was another Contabulous Fabtraption in disguise."
1495,*The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel* seemed like it would be too much for me but it was actually really good
1496,"boring title movies put me off, I think. Like *The Hunt*, *Loving*, *In This Corner of The World*, or *Official Secrets*."
1497,"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, Fallout, Rogue Nation. The names are just confusing, what order are they in? I don't remember which ones I have watched or not."
1498,"mother!

Fuck your lower case M and fuck your exclamation mark."
1499,"Mechanic: Resurrection (2015) made it seem like it was a reboot or a long awaited sequel to some movie in the 80's or 90's called Mechanic, but no, it was a sort-of sequel to The Mechanic which came out in 2011. Think about it: The producers of this movie sold it as if it were a reboot of some old franchise, because apparently that's what people like now right? reboots and sequels of old stuff?"
1500,"There's a Rami Malek movie on Netflix called ""Buster's Mal Heart."" It's not a bad movie at all but that title is such a word salad. Also I'm pretty sure it's not even grammatically correct, unless there's some clever double meaning that's going over my head. Even if that's the case, I still just don't like it as a title."
1501,Honey I Blew Up The Kid (1992) I wasn't interested at all to see it.
1502,Thoroughbreds. My girlfriend wanted to see it and I thought it was gonna be about these pair of friends who like horses. But I saw the RT score and thought might as well see it. Ended up being my favorite movie that year.
1503,Collateral Beauty is the dumbest fucking title to a movie I've ever heard.  I will never see that pretentious piece of shit no matter how strong the recommendation.
1504,"*The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford*. Should have just been called *The Assassination of Jesse James*. Great movie, but I ignored it for years and still think the title was a terrible mistake. It easily could have brought in a larger audience simply by not making the title sound like a history essay."
1505,"Edge of Tomorrow. Seemed so boring because of it. Turns out the original name was All You Need is Kill.

Also, Jonh Carter of Mars. Sounded like... a police movie or something"
1506,The Man who killed Hitler and then Bigfoot
1507,"I still don‚Äôt understand why it was Dr. Sleep and not ‚ÄòThe Shining 2: Dr. Sleep‚Äô

Oh and let‚Äôs never forget ‚ÄòPrecious: based on the novel ‚Äòpush‚Äô by sapphire‚Äù ..... like what?!"
1508,My Blueberry Nights. There's nothing in the title that interests me at all.
1509,"The Long Kiss Goodnight.  

Back when Netflix was mainly a DVD-by-mail service, my Dad and I received The Long Kiss Goodnight.  It must have sat on the counter for 2 months because we both thought it was some kind of Rom-Com and weren't really interested.  Finally, Dad's gf convinced us to give it a shot one night.  It's become a family favorite, and we can quote almost the whole thing now.    We almost never watched on of our favorite movies because of the title."
1510,"Recently, The Rhythm Section. The trailer seemed ok, but that title did absolutely nothing for me. When the bad reviews came out, that was enough for me to skip it. I'm not exactly sure what would have worked, and I have no idea of the relevance of the actual title, but something else could have got me to the theatre."
1511,"Mars Needs Moms. The title wasnt changed for the UK release, no one here is going to see a film with a 'moms' in the title."
1512,"RoboCop is and was a ridiculous title.  I had no interest in seeing it until I saw a late-night TV spot that represented the movie better and I ended up going to see it with a friend.  It was so good, we just stayed in the theater to see what would happen and nothing did, so we watched it again."
1513,"Even though I enjoy Little Nicky, the title kinda sucks. It doesnt really tell you alot like Waterboy (occupation/sports) Billy Madison ( a child like name) or Happy Gilmore (sounds sporty and similar to Billy Madison). I feel like calling it ""Hell of a good time"" or ""Hell of a city"" would be a better title. Hell even ""He's the devil"" would be better and funny."
1514,">""film title that has made you not want to see the film""

>""or changed your view on the film before you even saw it?""

I think that Parasite (2019) is a bad title for that particulr film - a great film by the way - but if you know nothing about the film that title feels gross and does not covey that you're facing a black comedy. If it is crucial to reflect parasite theme in the title, they could have used multi-word title that clarifies that it's metaphorical, like Dreams of Parasites or whatever. (Just an example of a multi-word title, obviously DoP is a lame title.)

Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) implies some Apocalyptic scale but not much happens and the whole thing is over in two or three days.

Antichrist (2009) isn't a bad title but I didn't want to see an Antichrist story by Lars von Trier. Funny thing is - I've learned that there is no Antichrist there, but still can't get past the title."

1517,"""The Mummy"" (2017 Film)

It's not terrible, just confusing. I kept seeing the trailers for it and wondering if it was a reboot of the Brendan Fraser films. Little did I know that it is more than just a ""Mummy"" movie, but also ties in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Should've called it something like ""Dr. Jekyll and the Curse of the Mummy,"" which sounds more like a classic adventure/monster movie."
1518,"An example of terrible translation, because the original title is La Casa Del Papel - which translates directly to English to ""The Paper House"" or ""House [made] of Paper"". 

And the show is about robbing a mint / money printing facility. So it's a rather clever play on words - the direct meaning, plus referring to the plan being risky.

Pretty average show though."
1519,Goodness it sounds like it stars Tara Reid and Nicolas Cage
1520,"I feel the same. It's just such a blatant title. Especially given the numerous heist films I've seen. Feels like I've seen the whole thing before even watching it, just based off the title."
1521,"House of Paper would be accurate. Or House of Money at least as it's translated like that in my country

I suspect it might have something to do with House of Cards so they changed it.

1527,"The movie was re-titled John Cater of Mars early on in development since the movie borrowed heavily from other books in the series (not just ""A Princess of Mars"") and was obviously meant to be the start of a franchise. 

Then the true dumb title change came where they dropped the of Mars part and just called the movie ""John Carter.""

The reason behind this change was that ""Mars Needs Moms"" had just bombed horribly for Disney and they didn't want the word Mars in the title of any movie since the last Mars movie had done so badly."

""A Princess of Mars"" would be a misleading name for a franchise too. But the book series is called 'John Carter of Mars'. That 'of Mars' makes it so much better and it was already there, no need to come up with anything."
1529,"Tragically, they changed the title at the last minute from John Carter of Mars, which has a wonderfully pulp/boy's own adventure feel to it. John Carter is just a ridiculously bland title for an expansive sci fi."

\* Well technically ""Force"" isn't a made-up word, but it would make absolutely no sense in that title except with its Star Wars definition."
1554,"Ohhh my god I liked the movie but the title is truly awful. I thought they would justify it by making the new name for the Force users rising out of the ashes of the Jedi but no.

It's supposed to be intentionally bad. It's a parody.

Even its title (good mention in this thread) was confusing. Nobody knew if it was a Birds of Prey movie or a Harley Quinn movie, and judging by the fact that the Birds of Prey have very little to do with it until the ending, they'd have probably made more money if they just called it Harley Quinn and let it lead into other things."
1617,"I'm not saying that there isn't an adult target audience for campy, but not all of it is going to go for an R-rated superhero movie. Surely you have to attract a larger, younger audience too. This is not like a TV show, where you can succeed with a niche audience, this is a movie intended for blockbuster status. The budget may not be particularly high by superhero movies standards, but it's still very high. It can't afford to be niche."

1622,">""That sounds horrible lol.""

It really is! It's just an example of multi-word title with a word 'parasite' in it. Good title takes time, and I don't care to brainstorm great milti-word title for hours - it will never be used anyway, that's a waste of time."

That may be my favourite part of the franchise (now I'll be downvoted into oblivion). But that doesn't make its title any better.

>""It's supposed to be intentionally bad. It's a parody.""

That's why it's listed in a section 'bad but very appropriate, you know that it is either exactly for you or you should never see it'.

>""The three X's refer to his three strikes, which leads to life in prison or death. It's supposed to reinforce the fact that Cage is a criminal, which is what puts the film into motion.""

It‚Äôs just a word. The trailer alone has Harley snorting coke out of the air to get hyped up to kill some people. It‚Äôs definitely not a tween movie and I really don‚Äôt think, outside of the colours and that one word was it really marketed toward tweens.

Maybe that‚Äôs part of the failings of the film. People see the marketing and think it‚Äôs going to be some tween aimed Hot Topic movie. But then it has an R rating so teens aren‚Äôt going to see it because they can‚Äôt."
1641,"I think that's exactly the brilliance of Parasite's marketing. The name and poster both seem like there will be some sort of sci fi element to the film. And Bong's filmography definitely points that way too. But the film is pretty normal, and even coaxes you into thinking nothing out of the ordinary will happen until towards the end of the second act. I went into it completely expecting something out of the ordinary and I know a lot of other people online felt the same. It's one of the things that gives Parasite its shock factor."

Though I do not think that they tried to do so, Bong Joon-Ho even said that distributors were against that title for that very reason."
1650,Bad move admitting Attack of the Clones exists if you‚Äôre trying to get new people into SW.

The trailer and poster are sci fi esque- nothing about them really say anything though. It‚Äôs really quite ambiguous and I think most of the sci fi connotations are put on by us rather than the marketing itself. I think calling anything about it‚Äôs marketing nefarious or a disrespectful hustle is a leap. The film is Korean, if they were trying to make money it wouldn‚Äôt be."
1655,">""I just think the film is really special.""

It is special but because of the contents, not because it has a divine title that fits the theme of the movie. It could have been called The Rock, The House, Families, Stairs, Korean Gambit, etc and it still would have been an amazing film, and it still would have been a film about leaching, and marketing still would have been ambiguous ('not exactly knowing what you‚Äôre going to get'). I'm not critising the movie, I'm critisizing an arguably misleading title.

>""are put on by us rather than the marketing itself""

I agree. But it was obvious that many will have that very impession, and they did not made an effort to prevent it. Inaction is also a choice."
1656,That‚Äôs fair. Inaction is definitely still a choice. All that being said I quite enjoyed not exactly knowing what the film would be like. And the ambiguous marketing really helped that for me.
1657,">""All that being said I quite enjoyed not exactly knowing what the film would be like. And the ambiguous marketing really helped that for me.""

Good for you! I also saw it without knowing what it is about, or even that it is a black comedy. I love that kind of experience but that doesn't happen that much nowadays since there are too many bad films and one should be carefull."

The shipping container is opened by two smugglers and patient zero escapes and evades capture throughout the movie while everyone and the whole city's infrastructure goes into a panic. As everything and everyone around them starts to crumble, the story follows a doctor and her daughter, as they go through the city and try to escape the outbreak. The ending was a schtick in my opinion, but it involved the daughter dying and screaming and telling soldiers not to shoot her mom, as a mob tried to overrun soldiers fending off a quaratine line.!<


I'm fairly certain the movie you are looking for is ""The Flu"" because of how you described patient zero and the shipping containers. This scene itself is distinctive enough to identify the movie.

1666,"Not my favorite of Yorgos Lanthimos either. Interesting for sure, but he has made better fims. The Lobster and The Favourite for example."
1667,"I think some of the reason you don't like it are reasons I really appreciate it (it's probably my favourite from *Lanthimos*). I love the coldness of the human relationship, I love the almost absurd/surrealist atmosphere which is balanced by the very and cold tone of the movie. 

[The spaghetti scene](https://youtu.be/dzRw5m18kdw) Is a perfect example of what I love in this movie, on one side the surreal exchange proposed by the boy, and on the other side the tragic situation of the wife. I also love the reversed power balance which make the scene feel a little bit like a very serious scene in a mafia movie in which the big bad is made very menacing while telling a little story and doing some random and normal stuff (which is natural in this situation, because the ""big bad"" isn't a mafia boss). 

>	Yet he invites him over to his house, let‚Äôs him be alone with his kids and then let‚Äôs him take his daughter out on a walk alone.

I don't see this as a problem. It's in line with the rest of the movie, *Collin Ferrel* sees himself as a sort of subtitution father for the boy. 

>	parents can just sense that sort of thing

Well, the parents are abnormal enough for this to be perfectly normal in this movie. 

>	Next, they never explain what the hell this high school kid did that not even top doctors from all over the world could solve.

And it doesn't matter, it's some fantastic in a non-fantastic movie you should accept as what it is. An idea that is there to developed a story and not think about the plausibility of the idea. It's the same thing as the hypnosis and special operation in **Get Out**, it's the same as the clone world in **Us**, the submissiveness drug in **Creepy**, etc... (i fail to find other examples right now, but there are a lot more) On the opposite, I'm sure it would have been a great waste if it had been explained."
1668,"I liked the story, but I did find the and robot-like acting/personalities to be weird.  I do think that this is to create more tension, and it definitely had a weird effect on me; it even resonated with me well after the film ended.  

I know this won't be a popular opinion, but I couldn't even finish David Lynch's Blue Velvet due to the weird acting.  It just comes off as disingenuous and found it distracting and annoying.  Even some of the scenes weren't believable like the closet scene near the beginning.  Maybe I'll give it another shot another time."
1669,"The movie is a modern interpretation of the Euripides tragedy Iphigenia in Aulis where Agamemnon decides to sacrifice his daughter to ensure victory over Troy.

Most of the answers to your questions, though, are answered by the knowledge that everyone had been drinking prior to surgery when the boy's dad died on the table and Colin Farrell's character feels incredible guilt over it."
1670,"It's honestly my least favorite of his films, possibly because I just couldn't buy into anything that was happening in such a real-world setting.

Part of the reason his other pictures work so well is because the locations, worlds, and time periods understandably blend with his style. Sacred Deer just begged so many questions, felt too alien, and had trouble interweaving his quirk with the bleakness of the story."
1671,"‚ÄúWell the parents are abnormal enough for this to be perfectly normal in the movie‚Äù 
Ok but why are they so strange. I get why the creepy kid is, but a Doctor? Who has to talk to and meet new people on a daily basis? I don‚Äôt think so. The movie expects to much suspension of disbelief which is funny you bring up Us because I also didn‚Äôt like that movie for the same reasons. In Get Out they at least tell us it‚Äôs hypnosis, in this movie there is literally nothing known of what the kid did. Lastly I think you have to agree with my last point about Collin Ferrels character killing his kid instead of his wife, you know that was dumb."
1672,"He is actually a heart surgeon, though, not a normal family doctor.  many surgeons lack the bedside manner of a family doctor.  Although that issue is kind of immaterial as in a movie where magic seemingly exists, should we necessarily be questioning the realness of other aspects of the film?"
1673,"Still your opinion. If you copy paste the reviewers' words, that's different story."
1674,"as long as you aren‚Äôt blindly going with what reviewers say, you‚Äôre good. it‚Äôs okay to change your mind about a movie when you hear someone else‚Äôs perspective"
1675,Sale people do it all day... every day.
1676,"On the DVD there's an option for subtitles to pop up during the ""Bar Story"" flashback where the narrator is speaking in Cockney Rhyming Slang. Its HILARIOUS. Also the Snatch DVD has ""Pikey Subtitles"" which is almost as good.

""don't plain and simple with me Bazza... Its for Spanking"" I love the villain in this movie almost as much as I Love Bricktop"
1677,Have you seen snatch?
1678,"In a movie with great characters and even better dialogue I loved this scene the most: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksMydLGN1oc

Guy Ritchie is a great visual director!"
1679,"Oh and eh, lads, it‚Äôs been emotional."
1680,My favorite part of this movie is the surprisingly good performance that Sting puts in. I wish he appeared in more movies.
1681,That one's on my watchlist now as I just watched Snatch the other day & it was really great!
1682,"I love Lock Stock. I think its Ritchie's best movie (Better than Snatch, although I do also like Snatch).

Fackin Northun Monkies

Fucking southern fairies"
1683,*Probably* my favorite Guy Ritchie movie. I've seen the movie countless times and that ending always cracks me up.
1684,It gets better every rewatch.
1685,Jesus I‚Äôm old
1686,"The Gentlemen was so-so... too much talking, not enough Matthew McConaughey."
1687,"I watched it, didn't like it. Maybe its like snatch, didn't like it the first time i watched it but liked it more each subsequent time and now ive seen it like 30 times and fucking LOVE the movie."
1688,"I love both this and Snatch but I gravitate more toward Lock, Stock.  

A combination of the movies color scheme, lack of known actors, and the low budget feel just makes it feel more gritty and down to earth to me. 

Snatch has like that Hollywood sheen on it that adds some glamor to the movie."
1689,"My uncle put me on To that movie a decade ago, classic."
1690,">On the DVD there's an option for subtitles to pop up during the ""Bar Story"" flashback where the narrator is speaking in Cockney Rhyming Slang

Interesting. I've only ever seen this version, even on TV. And I'm in the UK."
1691,Ya like dags?
1692,I haven‚Äôt seen his Snatch yet but definitely will at some point this year. I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs one of his best films. I‚Äôm also interested in watching Revolver and RockNRolla at some point too
1693,"""I WILL kill him!"""
1694,The old dvd I used to have didn't have it as an option. It was just always there.
1695,it's fer me ma
1696,I fucking hate pikeys!
1697,Oh...dogs. Yeah I like dags.
1698,"In my humble opinion, Snatch is top of the food chain as far as Guy Ritchie films go. Lock Stock is top notch, but I think Snatch will blow you away. So many great scenes, great characters, and outstanding style. Plus you get Bricktop in Snatch and that guy is one bad motherfucker."
1699,I can‚Äôt help that I laughed because ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen his snatch yet‚Äù
1700,Snatch might be one of the best movies of all time in my opinion.
1701,"Snatch and Lockstock are the only two Giy Richie films anyone ever needs to see. Both great, the rest are somewhere between poor and utter dog shit."
1702,/u/hitchlikersguide is correct. Snatch and Lock Stock are the only good movies he ever made. The rest were trash. Snatch is by far his best film.
1703,Skip Revolver or leave it for last. His weakest film next to Swept Away.
1704,Same. I just thought that was part of the movie.
1705,Periwinkle blue
1706,Your what?
1707,"I don't care if hes Mohammed ""i'm hard"" Bruce Lee, you can't change fighters!"
1708,"To me it's the other way around. Snatch was great, but I prefer the more downplayed humour and sluggish pace in Lock Stock. Snatch always seemed to me like it was Lock Stock 2.0, massaged to appeal more to a US audience. That's not a bad thing at all. I just preferred the style of the first one."
1709,It‚Äôs a fucking anti-aircraft gun Vincent.
1710,Stop me again when I'm walking!
1711,"Sit down & shit up you bald, fat fuck"
1712,In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary..... Come again?
1713,No thanks Errol. I'm sweet enough.
1714,"ya take sugar?

nah, i'm sweet enough!"
1715,I thought of Madonna. Happy cake day!
1716,I'm glad I wasn't the only one who found that funny hahaha
1717,I cant pick a beat scene in snatch.
1718,The Man from U.N.C.L.E. was good too. Not the same style of film but very watchable.
1719,"RockNRolla was good, man, don't know what you're talkin about"
1720,ouch! it's not that bad.
1721,cause he dodges bullets avi
1722,You can take bets at the fight!
1723,I agree -- l think all the parts came together in a better and more intricate way in Lock Stock. Something about how the violent pikeys fixed everything in the end of Snatch rubbed me the wrong way. A borderline deus ex machina.

1725,Ari...
1726,"Nope. Not his worst; rock, King Arthur etc... but def not good in any way"
1727,It was fucking dog shit.
1728,"Yeah maybe not THAT bad, lol!"
1729,"My favorite is still: ""The Japanese are our only allies left, and between you and me, they don't really look that Aryan."""
1730,Another great moment: Jojo insists that Jews love ugly things and then sees his own scarred face in the mirror. One of my favorite movies of 2019
1731,"I liked ""Fuck off Hitler"""
1732,"Thomasin Mckenzie is an incredible actress for someone so young. I recommend ""leave no trace"" which was cruelly ignored by the academy"
1733,"Here's another badass line:  ""Shoot him again, his soul is still dancing!"""
1734,"It's badass. Then again, it's easy to be badass when you only have to intimidate little Jojo. I thought Elsa was more badass when the Gestapo guys came and she coolly pretended to be someone else.

But anyway, in that scene I suppose that Elsa was saying it more for herself than for Jojo, as a way to remind herself that even if they were persecuted and treated like dirt, there was nothing to be ashamed of in being Jewish.

Regarding the opinion some have expressed in this thread, saying that it's a supremacist statement, I think it's all a matter of context. there's nothing wrong in feeling proud of what you are and where you come from, as long as it doesn't make you think you're better than anybody else. I don't think in that scene Else meant that Jewishness was something to be proud of, not that everyone else was inferior to them."
1735,"*""Yes, that's where we live, in your stupid head.""*

My fav film of last year <3"
1736,"Elsa: Say it. Say it. Say what I am. 

Jojo: A Jew.

Elsa: *Gesundheit*

I really loved this line."
1737,">JoJo:  What did they do?

>Rosie:  They did what they could.

I thought that was the best line.  And great foreshadowing."
1738,"This was such a simple line but I loved when Hitler goes to Jojo ""Can I give you some really good advice?""."
1739,"Me and my girlfriend saw this just recently, towards the end of its run. We both loved it way more than we expected to. I appreciated that it didn't compromise in showing how it feels to be someone that's living under heavy propaganda or who's been brainwashed. The movie never says ""This person is a bad person"" but instead it shows that they're simply living in a manufactured reality, that they need help.

A very unexpected part was how the actual violence was very grounded, with very few exceptions. You directly connect that ""Oh, it's not just JoJo, this is the fallout of when this happens en masse."" Fantastic movie that nails its intended message, which is very serious, while still being the best comedy I've seen in quite awhile."
1740,I liked the one about how dancing is for people who don't have jobs.
1741,That line delivery was stellar. One of my favorite parts of the film.
1742,"Dude the screenplay was so good too, I just finished reading it and it deserved the Oscar."
1743,"I‚Äôd love to see more stories revolving around jewish pride. I remember that as a kid I‚Äôd get tired of having an eternal mental image of jewish people as victims to pity for the holocaust and little to nothing else (Which obviously they were, and was horrible). So when Inglourious Basterds came out and proudly portrayed a jewish platoon running around occupied france it was a real kick. Just destroying the fascists left and right."
1744,Would you say it's a hidden gem?
1745,"Seems like reverse racism to me /s

Ninja edit: Oh wait. People said this unironically"
1746,"I liked:     

‚ÄúThis is just a picture of my head.‚Äù      

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs where we live.‚Äù"
1747,"Sam Rockwell is my next ""oh wow he was good in that,"" actor like Gary Oldman. I don't think there was a single weak performance in JoJo Rabbit."
1748,I kept hearing this in Christoph Waltz‚Äôs voice
1749,"FTFY: ""You were chosen by a pathetic little man you can't even grow a full mustache."""
1750,"I seriously thought it would win best oscar maybe i was delusional because i really liked it.  One of the best movies i have seen other than ford vs Ferrari.

And yet have no desire to see any of the other nominated movies. Edit i did see once upon a time."
1751,"You misquoted the girl's description of Hitler. In the linked scene she says:

""...pathetic little man who can't even grow a full mustache."""
1752,What does it mean? I don't know much about Jew and Aryan culture.
1753,was Hitler fat? i always see him as slender in any photos/videos
1754,"It's also a reflection of the mocking of Jesus on the Cross. 

Matthew 27:39-41
>39 The people who were going by shouted blasphemies at Jesus. They shook their heads at him.


>40 ‚ÄòSo!‚Äô they said. ‚ÄòYou were going to destroy the Temple and build it in three days, were you? Save yourself, if you‚Äôre God‚Äôs son! Come down from the cross!‚Äô

>41 The chief priests, too, and the scribes and the elders, mocked him."
1755,Hitler wasn't fat though.
1756,"That clip is apparently for kids, according to YouTube."
1757,"""Fuck off, Hitler."""
1758,"Line is cool, but wrestle angels is massively underselling what happened with Jacob. He wrestled *God* and basically won."
1759,"> We were chosen by God 

Yeah, it be nice if they stopped using that as political propaganda of their own in the middle-east."
1760,"I still can‚Äôt believe this movie was his first time acting, and the movie was nominated and won awards, this kids gonna have a great career"
1761,This really was the best movie of 2019.
1762,Not so much. Judaism and the Talmud teaches that Jews are the master race and that gentiles  (non-Jews are) unclean and unworthy to be treated as friends or equals.
1763,/r/Im14AndThisIsDeep
1764,"I loved the movie and that quote has some epic on it. However I thought that they will tell in some way how that quote is just the same as being proud of bein arian. That there aren't races better than other and all of them are humans no matter what they believe in.

It bugs me that they let this reference like that, knowing that the whole movie message is about fighting against the extremism and critical thinking."
1765,Love jewish supremecists pretending like they are right
1766,LOOOOOOOoOOOOOOLLLL!!!! OK I have absolutely GOT to see this now.
1767,"""Chosen by God"" 

That character definitely would have grown to be a Zionist"
1768,"You could replace ""Jews"" with any group of people who think they are superior to everyone else, and you end up with the same problems we see today. 

People believe and act as if antisemitism exists in a vacuum. 

If only Reddit didn't learn history from Hollywood propaganda."
1769,Movie was just not good. Jokes fell flat. The message has been done before in better films. The characters were written very poorly. Taika is overrated.
1770,"Sounds like a bunch of psych ward babble to me, but I'm not really into myth propaganda."
1771,Oh that was great. I need to memorize this and slightly alter it for Trumpers.
1772,"> What a fucking badass thing to say to a child who mocks your race because of Nazi propaganda.

This movie technically is Jewish propaganda.

Judaism is a religion, not a race. They're considered 'ethnoreligious' even though it's mostly just religious.

As a collective group, their identity is somewhat elitist, what with that whole Chosen people stuff and their religious values can tend to be somewhat bigoted. This scene from Knocked Up for example:

https://youtu.be/ziQJsG6s8c4?t=75

Not really saying this to bash on Jewish people but holy hell, just cool it with the Nazis for a bit."
1773,sounds like the same bullshit the nazis peddled just reversed tbh
1774,That kid was unbelievable. The hugs between him and Jojo were priceless with the little leg kick.
1775,Miniature Nick Frost was indeed a highlight.
1776,"^This!
Was by far my favorite line and was looking for it here."
1777,Haha yes!!! Loved this movie.  I really liked it when he said he was going home to get a cuddle from his mom!!
1778,Literally the best place they could‚Äôve put their one f bomb
1779,"That seems to be Taika's favourite too.


Korg(tries to kick Loki's hologram): Fuck off, ghost!"
1780,This may sound oddly specific and am not nitpicking but I would have found it so much funnier if he kicked him in the balls instead of just kicking him through the window
1781,Taika Waititi presents: ‚ÄúHitler Bad: A Wes Anderson Parody‚Äù
1782,Seriously.  I can‚Äôt wait to see what she does in the future.
1783,"I didn't realize it was the same actress. Yeah, she's got quite a career ahead of her. *Leave No Trace* was really powerful and criminally under-seen. I checked it out because it was the same director as *Winter's Bone* which I regard as one of the best American films of the 21st Century."
1784,"I watched this right after watching Jojo Rabbit and she is incredible.  Mark my words, she'll be holding an Oscar one day."
1785,I knew that as a line from the song Coffin Dance by AJJ. Wonder if it can be traced back further
1786,Hey could you give me a quick refresher on when that line was said?
1787,That‚Äôs is indeed badass!
1788,Loved the Gestapo scene.  She looked a lion in the eye.

Unless the ""anybody else"" is nazis. Fuck nazis. Lower than pond scum."
1790,"I love that line along with the line she gives at the dinner table when asked what she does all day.

Rosie: ""What I can."""
1791,"There are a lot of good lines in the film, but this one got me thinking."
1792,Even the Nazi captain who dreams about being back on the front line ended up being a good dude at heart
1793,It did win adapted screenplay tho
1794,Are screenplays for big movies like this easily available? Any website where I can find them?
1795,I know this thread is a bit of a Jojo jerk off but I much preferred Little Women. The quality of the writing in Jojo is really good but the substance is tone deaf & incredibly misguided IMO.
1796,"Kinda missed the point then. It was basically a role reversal in many ways, especially the first scene with the German officer and the Bear Jew. If you'd turn it around, with an Allied officer refusing to disclose the location of his fellow soldiers and getting beaten to death with a baseball bat by a Nazi it would clearly be to establish the Nazi as the antagonist. 

But now, because of a greater historic context and a reversal in uniforms, people cheer it on blindly.

The whole movie (Inglourious Basterds) is basically telling us that everyone in war is bad, that *war* is bad, that what is permissible and acceptable depends on who wins the war and only afterward do we decide who we, as outsiders, were supposed to cheer for and who we were supposed to hate.

The same with this quote in many ways. ""I am descended from those who wrestle angels and kill giants. We were chosen by God."" is being used as an excuse to do some horrid shit in Palestine. And 'we' can't comment on it, because history decided who is good and who is bad."
1797,Definitely not an uncut one though.
1798,"You can't out-awful reality, you should have learned that by now."
1799,"I mean, circumstances and context do matter a lot. It would be rather troubling if someone stated the line in question as a general view on life (and there are religious sects that use this sort of mentality to justify being insufferable cockbags to everyone else). But in the context of the film and what she was facing, yes, obviously it's about facing down someone who sees you as less than human. But this is reddit...you can't expect people to have actually watched the damn film they're opining on. /s"
1800,"If you go looking for the ugly in people, you will always succeed."
1801,"The nominated movies this year are actually all pretty decent films, not one I'd consider a stinker (although that's not to say there weren't other films also worthy of consideration). Each of them is worth your time.

Your tastes are your own, of course, but give them a look if you get a chance."
1802,"There are a couple of Biblical references in the quote. Jacob wrestled with an angle for a night. David killed Goliath. Obviously, they were Jewish, God's people. 

Hitler called the people he deemed superior Aryan. They were ""superior"" because of blonde hair, blue eyes, white skin etc. Basically, Elsa uses the Biblical history of the Jewish people to impress Jojo, to scare him. She has to keep him under the thumb or he might tell on her."
1803,"In Biblical passages, all of the religious prophets are Jews who commit supernatural feats (fight angels, defeat giants, and many more) under the blessing of God - hence, they are the ""chosen people"". Even Jesus was a Jew. 

This is a popular notion. Heck, even my religion acknowledges that they are special because of this fact.

Hitler encouraged the idea of an ""Aryan"" race during his time in Germany during World War 2, an ideal and superior race. Jojo, a German boy with blue eyes and blonde hair, boasts about this fact and also about his features as an Aryan. Before his significant character development in the film, he viewed the Jews as less than human because of the propaganda against them. 

Elsa won't take his shit and proceeds to beat him, while stating the quote above. This is an amazing example of defiance."
1804,"The line is actually, ""you were chosen by a pathetic little man who can't even grow a full mustache."""
1805,"Yes he was. And he had one testicle. His penis was only a quarter of an inch long, and it grew out of his hairy bellybutton.

What you going to do? Defend Hitler?"
1806,"Child actors, even good ones, often do not have great acting careers as adults. I have to agree, though, that the kid who interpreted Jojo did an excellent job. It was not a particularly easy role, having to sell his inner fantasy world, his childish belief in the nazi ideas he had been taught..."
1807,It‚Äôs not being said in the context of squatting on Palestinian land. It‚Äôs said in the context of World War II.
1808,"I agree with you that in a modern context I would assume any Jew who said some shit like this was a bigot and not to be trusted. This is the type of thing someone would say to you right before going on a rant about how we need to kill all the Palestinians or something.

But in the context of it being said by a girl whose family was murdered, whose people are being exterminated like animals and who the entire world seems to not give a fuck about I don't have a problem with it. When you're facing total genocide and the world has abandoned you I don't think there's a problem with believing in the strength (and maaaaybe even superiority) of your people. It's something you need to do to keep your will to live."
1809,"People misinterpret this quote and think that it's implying that the Jews are better than everyone. It's always about something political. 

No, this was a great quote because this girl who literally can die any minute still finds the strength to take pride in her identity as a Jew and draws strength from her ancestor's achievements. She will not let a little boy talk shit about her people because she knows that her people are great and therefore, she is great and not just a piece of shit that the Nazis would like to slaughter."

1846,"Aryan was pushed before WW2 in a build up and justification for Germany to go to war again the lesser Slavic races for land for the German people, called lebensruam, which was already an older concept dating back to the early 1850s. It   wasn‚Äôt a during the war creation."
1847,"I know, but still, that whole dialogue is about whose race is best. The message is harmful in everyway if tok out of context, that in that scene is to mock the idea of the aryan race. My headcannon is that they use that to mock every supremacist set of beliefs as absurd."
1848,"I think it's similar to that one scene in Game of Thrones with Sansa and Myranda:

Sansa: ""I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home, and you can't frighten me."" After Myranda subtly tries to scare her by suggesting that Ramsey might kill her by throwing her to the dogs

She's literally gonna be offered to him on a silver plate, she hates him because he invaded her home (Winterfell), and she's bathed by someone who hates her (Myranda), and she's alone with no one who can actually help her. But she takes comfort in the fact that Winterfell belongs to the Starks, it is the home where she grew up in and where she belongs, no one can take it from her, and she won't let a mere nobody threaten her in her home.

Of course, what happens next is sad, but in that one moment, Sansa felt defiant and powerful."
1849,"Yes, I understand the context and it's ok. I find it more like a meta problem. In the sense that they opened a great way of talk about supremacism in any form, but they just went for the easy thing for making the audience cheer.

It's not bad, I understand it, and it's a cool moment, I liked it. But it bugged me for that lost opportunity. This is a movie that's not historically accurate and takes a lot of licenses to equate out modern world to this WWII depiction. For example JoJo's bedroom all filled with propaganda as if hitler was a fabricated celebrity idol nowadays, the clones (wich is a reference to a movie), the Captain and his new uniform. It won't feel awkward to talk a bit more about supremacism in genral.

However I'm ok with it, just bugs me because I felt it as a lost opportunity."
1850,"I understand the intention of the quote. But it's relying too much, IMO, in wich one is more powerful or the best. When I think that stating that some race is better than any other goes against the point they are trying to state. However is just a minor thing that bugged me in an overall movie. Not because I'm feeling offended, but because I felt it like a cheesy way to earn a cheer from the audience by staying on the surface of that question."
1851,Sorry I'm too busy being oppressed by white people to spell correctly
1852,"Oh I‚Äôm ready. I know Taika is the current big deal and everyone loves him, but I honestly can‚Äôt stand him. I‚Äôve seen 4 of his films none made me laugh or were enjoyable. Most were very cringe."
1853,Perhaps in context. Maybe I need to see the movie.
1854,"RES to the rescue:

>I'm not 100% sure about this but apparently the British attacked German cities before the Germans attacked British cities.  Here's footage from the Dresden Firebombing

-

>Yes it happened, but the entire thing could have been avoided, and the blame doesn't completely fall on the Nazis.

-

>No, it could have been avoided if the British and French governments hadn't kept pressuring the Germans after WW1. All of that stuff was due to local national politics and didn't have fuck all to do with the Jews until the Zionists got involved.

He might not be a Nazi, but he sure is Nazi-adjacent."
1855,"The Nazis were a European political party that lasted between the mid 1930s and 1940s. That was over 80 years ago yet here you are calling me a Nazi because Hollywood shoehorns Nazis into everything the possibly can. 

Fuck the Nazis. Hitler was an idiot.

Your media system acts like Trump is like Hitler. How the fuck does that work considering Trump does whatever Netenyahu tells him? Israel just named a settlement after Trump yet somehow he's also the leader of white supremacist anti semites?

The US has the biggest military in the world. Because of the way the US military is embedded into Hollywood, they've put out over like 1800 movies and TV shows that are laced with propaganda.

The US has also been at war for almost 2 decades in like 6 different countries which is nothing compared to the laundry list of countries overthrown by the CIA.

The US destroyed it's journalism industry by letting big media companies engulf it and turn it into tabloid & partisan garbage industry designed to cause divisions and make people call each other stupid names like Nazis."
1856,">I don‚Äôt necessarily hate Nazis

>I don‚Äôt even particularly like Jews

All the bigots show themselves eventually"
1857,"> Tbh I don't necessarily hate Nazis and support Jews. 

The Nazis were horrible and the Jews are alright. 

> This post isn't really about anything political or religious.

To you it's not but it is to Israel who uses the Nazis as a way to gain sympathy, free financial, and military aid.

[This dude](https://anothermanimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1200/349-0-1260-1395/azure/anotherman-prod/370/4/374447.jpg) is Palestinian. This picture went viral. Israel doesn't like people seeing images like that because it ruins their public image.

Here's a good documentary on this subject.

1858,No they won't. They're a T_D poster.
1859,"""I'm going to go home to my mom, I need a snuggle"""
1860,"""JOJO!"" *Launches a rocket into a building.*"
1861,When hes handed the gun and without hesitating charges right into battle screaming.
1862,There isn't actually any rule. Just guidelines.
1863,"Gunners palace, is a PG-13 war documentary with 42 uses of the word fuck. I think it was originally rated R, but after appeal they gave it a PG-13 rating.

> Under normal circumstances more than one use of the word ""fuck"" would get a film an R-rating. In this instance, the MPAA reasoned that a person old enough to be recruited by the army should be allowed to view a documentary on actual army life. However the rating also carried the notice that it was awarded on appeal to provide a better cautionary warning to parents concerned about what their children are viewing."
1864,"‚ÄúHow many F-bombs do you need, Mr. Spielberg?‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Spielberg, we‚Äôve covered ourselves in F-bombs for your movie!‚Äù"
1865,The Martian definitely has more than 1 as well.
1866,He's freakin' gone.
1867,"Ah, right"
1868,"Oh I thought they meant it was from Jojo rabbit, thanks anyway!"
1869,"Holy shit, I need to give that flick another try. When I first saw it I didn't really like it but that was years ago with younger eyes."
1870,Well I know what I‚Äôm watching tonight.
1871,"When I watched it I thought there was a good chance he knew/possibly even helped the resistance.

Operation screw up seemed on purpose to me, Scarlets character seemed familiar enough to hit him and not expect retribution, he's 100% gay"
1872,Wow didnt pick up on that
1873,"I fully agree

On a side note, it‚Äôs kind of weird to me that Joker was nominated for adapted screenplay because it was only using characters and not a direct story from the comics"
1874,It‚Äôs a jerk off when everyone is just repeating the same 5 damn talking points about it.
1875,"I don't think it handled the holocaust well at all. I think if I had to whittle it down I'd say the amount of joy it has in the first half of the movie feel problematic when the second half is just way too light on the subject of war. We didn't need more jokes during the battle scene, but Taika was in his own way about it. 

This is all made worse by trying to make Sam Rockwell's character sympathetic while the soldiers liberating the town were played to be assholes and cruel. WW2 was not a ""both sides' situation.

Edit: Replied to a few of these but honestly it is not worth my time or energy to hear people defend nazi's. Acknowledging that the allies did bad things does not make WW2 a nuanced thing and is the equivalent of people trying to frame the US Civil War as about state rights and poking at the North's war crimes. Like, holy shit y'all it should not have to be explained that genocide is above pretty much anything else and the people who were on the side of it do not need defending!"
1876,"Do the same for Jewish scientists and artists, and it's pretty clear that Hitler was wrong."
1877,"Maybe don't say the phrase ""Hitler was right"" on a response thread about an antifascist film. You can always get your upvotes on thedon*ald or something.

You might be shitposting, but as the film itself makes clear, you guys really have shit for brains."
1878,"Then you would be a goddamn idiot.

The only good thing Hitler ever did was to kill Hitler."
1879,Ah yes but only look up the famous ones with the highest accomplishments and don't look up ANY other ethnicities
1880,I don't think that's a point that really needs correcting.
1881,"Try to understand this in the context of the situation of the film. Imagine you are a girl whose entire people is currently being wiped out. Now this little boy is talking shit about your dying people. You're less than human in his eyes while he deems himself as superior. As if things couldn't get worse. 

How dare that little boy mock you. Of course, after months and months of living as an animal, Elsa lashed out and she shot down his notion of superiority through attacking one of the biggest sources of his pride. 

You wouldn't relate until this happens to you. 

People misinterpret this quote and think that it's implying that the Jews are better than everyone. It's always about something political. 

This was a great quote because this girl who literally can die any minute still finds the strength to take pride in her identity as a Jew and draws strength from her ancestor's achievements. She will not let a little boy talk shit about her people because she knows that her people are great and therefore, she is great and not just a piece of shit that the Nazis would like to slaughter."
1882,Nah.
1883,"Try to understand this in the context of the situation of the film. Imagine you are a girl whose entire people is currently being wiped out. Now this little boy is talking shit about your dying people. You're less than human in his eyes while he deems himself as superior. As if things couldn't get worse. 

How dare that little boy mock you. Of course, after months and months of living as an animal, Elsa lashed out and she shot down his notion of superiority through attacking one of the biggest sources of his pride."
1884,It's not a director fault if you just had a bad taste.
1885,"Based on my RES tags, they're a Holocaust denier, which pretty much puts them in the Nazi category."
1886,"I lost you at Trump. 

 Taika didn't make the movie for americans. Why do you have to shoehorn Trump into everything you possibly can?"
1887,"> The Nazis were a European political party that lasted between the mid 1930s and 1940s.

Oh my, what a wonderful day. An actual, honest-to-god ""you can't call me a Nazi because I'm not a literal NSDAP member from the 1930s"" comeback. 

I thought they were just a myth."
1888,"
>yet here you are calling me a Nazi because Hollywood shoehorns Nazis into everything the possibly can. 

Yeah why does Hollywood keep shoehorning Nazis into a movie set in WWII era Germany?"
1889,And they'll never see the movie. They don't do anything that would risk broadening their mind.
1890,"Yeah, it's about context. The Martian had two."
1891,"Ayy, matey."
1892,Mr. Spielberg we've got your buckets of blood over here.
1893,"Fuck you, Mars. What else?"
1894,"Good rule of thumb. Disney will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever EVER allow an f-bomb, regardless of what they're allowed. Ever.

Edit - If released under the Disney or Marvel banner. Need to clarify."
1895,"Dude had a pink ""battle outfit"" and was EXTREMELY close with his military buddy hahaha it was pretty out there"
1896,"Nothing weird about it. The script adapted existing characters. It‚Äôs an adapted screenplay. 

Basically, if a film is based on any existing intellectual property, it‚Äôs an adapted screenplay."
1897,">‚ÄúLiberating the town‚Äù
 
ü§î 

I‚Äôd suggest reading up on the Battle of Berlin if you think that the soldiers involved were portrayed as being ‚Äúassholes and cruel‚Äù in Jojo. It was called ‚Äúthe Rape of Berlin‚Äù for a reason, and it was infinitely worse than the film portrays. (And I‚Äôm not suggesting that the film needed to go there, but the soldiers in it were definitely not unfairly portrayed.)"
1898,"WW2 wasn't a both sides situation, but there were decent Germans in the German army. There were even (a small number of) decent Germans in the Nazi party - Oscar Schindler was a member, John Rabe was another. There were also war atrocities committed by the allies. Recognition of these facts does not mean that you think the allies were as bad as the Nazis, not a point of view the film takes - it's absolutely anti-Nazi.

The juxtaposition of humour and horror isn't for everyone, and it clearly didn't appeal to you, which is fair enough.

Personally, I found Little Woman decent but not good enough to be on the Best Picture list. It was nowhere near as good as Ladybird, for example. I just think the material it drew on was too stale."
1899,"I would disagree. For one, this is not a film about the holocaust. This is a film about a boy in the Hitler Youth slowly finding out about the reality of Nazi Germany. And he comes to his conclusions without even seeing the death camps (which most Germans only seen after the war, though their existance was assumed). 

As for Rockwell's character: I liked him the way he was. He was somebody not fit for the Nazi ideology, yet he managed to hide this successfully. People like him existed. And I don't think showing him feeds into the clean Wehrmacht myth. They are responsile for plenty of crimes, yet down to the individual soldier we can't say all of them were evil or war criminals.

And while there were jokes until the end, this was a comedy drama after all. In my eyes, it didn't take away from the emotional moments, the gut wrenchers or the depiction of the senseless carnage that was this war. 

And last but not least: Yes WW2 was a ""both sides"" situation. Every war is. Don't get me wrong, I am thankful the allies won. But let's not forget how the Red Army raped through the countryside and the Western Allies commited warcrimes like bombing civilians too. Yes, the greater evil was stopped, no doubt. But that doesn't absolve the other side from their share of evil deeds. 

In any case, I thought the depiction was fair. >!The worst the allied forces did was shoot prisoners. Though we don't exactly know the circumstances, as we only hear the gun shots after Sam Rockwell's character starts fighting his guards.!< And it's not like the movie portraits fascism positively in any way. It's either ridiculed or shown for the dangerous toxic ideology it is. At no point had I the feeling that it glorified Nazi Germany in any way. And I am sensitive to that."
1900,Taste is subjective. And yeah he‚Äôs a bad director I‚Äôm one of the few that can see past his bullshit and see what a hack is really is.
1901,"One of his comments:

>The main reason why a political party from Europe, 80 years ago is mentioned almost fucking daily is due to decades of propaganda disguised as entertainment 

Definitely a Nazi sympathizer"
1902,"Cry-Baby has 4. Three of which are in a single sentence! Still PG-13. 

Hair has f bombs and titties and dick. Rated **PG** (though, this was prior to the PG-13 rating, but still. TITTIES AND DICK and they didn‚Äôt give it the solid R rating). 

There is no ‚Äúone f bomb per PG-13 movie‚Äù rule. That‚Äôs just some stupid internet meme. There really aren‚Äôt any rules. The MPAA just makes up shit where they want. Gay romance gets rated R where similarly graphic straight romances are PG-13 (only mildly better than decades past when any gay relationship automatically got the movie to NC-17 status (ahem But I‚Äôm A Cheerleader would be PG-13 by today‚Äôs status, let‚Äôs be real)). 

If you want to learn about the MPAA and how ludicrous they are, check out the documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated."
1903,That‚Äôs probably my favorite RLM moment of all time
1904,"I had to look it up because I couldn't remember exactly where it was: 

> After the surgery is performed successfully Watney leans back and says a single word: ""Fuck."""
1905,Why's that?
1906,"Ahh alright, I thought it only pertained to books, plays etc"
1907,"There is a scale to these things. Nazi's were pure evil. Plain and simple. In a movie trying to condemn them, we did not need to have it portrayed that some nazi's were nice and some allies were cruel.

I never once said that the allies didn't do shit, but that it's not a both sides situation. There is what they did and then there is fucking genocide."
1908,"I've seen this argument and I couldn't disagree more. The holocaust is too important of an event to have any ww2 movie set in Germany that features Jewish characters not be about the holocaust. To say that it isn't is just whitewashing history. That atrocity is too huge and the wound still hasnt healed for us to not acknowledge that.

If you fought in the german army you are a war criminal. This is dangerous territory that we could, even for a second, say ""not all Nazi's were evil"". He partook in indoctrinating hundreds of people into nazism. I'm sorry thats black and white. Even if he did a nice thing here or there it doesn't outweigh that. Saving Jojo doesn't count for shit when the whole reason Jojo is in this position is because of the evil he taught him.

The senseless carnage was completely undercut multiple times by goofy ass jokes like rebel wilson with the kids. 

The war in europe was 100% a black and white situation. There was a country trying to take over the world and exterminate an entire group of people and those trying to stop them. It's not like WW1 or something. Faults on the allies side should be acknowledged in their own right but not in this context and not like that. 

It didn't glorify nazi germany, I never said that. The movie had good intentions. But it botched it's condemnation of them."
1909,"Although I agree in you in that the movie fell flat for me, Waititi's other films (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What we do in the shadows, heck even Ragnarok) are all pretty great so calling yourself ""one of the few that can see his past bullshit"" is just patting yourself on the back for being different and edgy. That being said I agree on the fact that taste is subjective and I very much disagree with the guy above you calling your taste bad because you dislike a director's work."
1910,Just dripping with edge there.
1911,"Don't worry, this comment from /u/tetayk comes from a genius that makes comments like this

https://www.reddit.com/r/NSFWFunny/comments/f2cfm6/tattoo_commitment/fhd8ynd/

He wouldn't know anything about taste, just a cringy greasy redditor"
1912,">There is no ‚Äúone f bomb per PG-13 movie‚Äù rule. That‚Äôs just some stupid internet meme.

To be fair, I'm old (by internet standards anyway) and people have been saying this since long before the internet, let alone memes, were a thing."
1913,"I read this entire post expecting you to say ""fuck"" four times and got none, so I'd like my money back, please"
1914,Nothing will ever beat the osteoporosis dance IMO.
1915,Because it's Disney. They ave a history of being extremely family friendly and wholesome. The Guardians Of The Galaxy IP is more than likely their limit on foul language. It'd be headline news if a Disney or Marvel movie had the work fuck in it.
1916,Whiplash was considered an adapted screenplay when it was nominated because they considered it based on the short film Whiplash that was just a scene from the full script produced to help.get funding for the full movie.
1917,Movie remakes are also considered adapted screenplays. When they presented the A Star is Born nomination last year they said adapted from the 1954 and 1976 films.
1918,"
>meme
>/mƒìm/
>*noun*
>an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, especially imitation.

The word meme came about in the 70s and comes from an old Greek word. 

The one-f-bomb rule counts. 

Also, I‚Äôm old by internet standards too."
1919,"Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. 

Threw in an extra one for your trouble."
1920,We'll see what happens with Deadpool 3 then
1921,Same with Sling Blade in 1996
1922,haha that's wild
1923,Well that is a pretty cut and dry adaptation
1924,"Yes, but you specifically said ""internet meme""."
1925,"Crazy that movie had a $1m budget and most everything nowadays has to have at least 10x that number 

I think Taiki Waititi keeps it pretty cheap, though"
1926,Well that‚Äôs what it is now isn‚Äôt it?
1927,"I didn't find it to be outright scary. There are just some intense, unsettling moments that play through-out. It's a brilliant movie. Highly recommended."
1928,It's not scary at all. Just tense and suspenseful and I'm not a horror watcher.
1929,"Wasn't scary to me... Good, intense situations and great acting.

Wierd story, for sure."
1930,"At the end, the old lady said that Tokyo used to be mostly under water, and maybe that's the way it's meant to be. All the fish-themed stuff of the water phenomenon also hinted that maybe the place is supposed to be part of the ocean. Other parts of the movie showed that the whole ""sunshine girl"" being sacrificed to preserve dry weather has happened before. Hina and Hodaka chose to break the cycle of having girls sacrificed to keep the area above water, and return it to its natural state."
1931,"I would say something in the line of ""You don't have on sacrifice yourself to change something that can't be changed, something which can't be stopped."" And I'm not sure, but wasn't a large party of the bay of Tokyo under water a few hundreds years ago ? This could also be a way to say ""fuck"" to the previous generation of people who contributed to destroy and deform the environment."
1932,Krull
1933,"Actually a source says the miniseries is actually going to tell stories that the film left out or did not explore fully (e.g. the housekeeper‚Äôs face, her relationship with the original architect and how she knows of the bunker). 

Source: https://www.indiewire.com/2020/01/parasite-tv-series-bong-joon-ho-six-hour-movie-1202205540/

In my theory, I feel Mark Ruffalo is maybe going to play either (1) one of the Germans who rented the house at the end of the movie, (2) the architect himself (not sure if the architect was actually featured in the movie) or (3) another new character."
1934,"Getting Mark Ruffalo to Star is a power move and must mean the script is good. Since the year 2008 he‚Äôs had 18 ‚Äòfresh‚Äô scores on rottentomatoes and 4 ‚Äòrotten‚Äô scores. In fact, since 2013 he‚Äôs only had one film score below a 75%. 

Bong Joon Ho is apparently involved so I have a little more hope for this than I did when it was initially announced, but your skepticism is warranted!"
1935,"Saw it yesterday . I very much enjoyed it .  It would have to maintain the same story arc for me to be interested in it. The absolutely  foreign place, people and language is what was so intriguing to me."
1936,"The HBO limited series is supposed to expand the movie, not a total remake. I do not want it to be separate from the movie. I want it to share a common theme at least if it stands under the same title.

I do not necessarily want it to be in Korean unless they cast the exact same people from the movie (which is likely to be imposssible). It would be interesting if it were made in Korean with subtitles though.

I do not want it to introduce other social elements such as racial conflicts. The movie parasite was not meant for that. Parasite be Parasite."
1937,"Interesting. While I dont expect much, it won't detract from the movie so I'll check it out"
1938,"The architect was named Namgoong Hyenja; highly doubtful that's who Ruffalo will be playing. And given that we saw the patriarch of the German family who moved in there, that probably won't be it either. He almost has to be a new character."
1939,Most of those fresh scores are from MCU so it doesn‚Äôt mean much
1940,"Probably my dislike to him is one of those things where you just don‚Äôt like people, but recently watched Spotlight and he was pretty good."
1941,"\*Bong AND Adam McKay are both involved, so I am definitely down for this if they're both hands on."
1942,"That‚Äôs what I meant, but I feel like you should watch the show and think of Parasite rather than watch Parasite and think of the show"
1943,"Spotlight, Dark Waters, and Foxcatcher are his only non blockbuster films in the last 6 years and they‚Äôre all fantastic. He‚Äôs also done a lot of great films in the past. It doesn‚Äôt mean the show won‚Äôt be shit, but I‚Äôd rather have a high-profile actor associated with high quality work than one who isn‚Äôt lol"
1944,"Don't really know why you gotta disparage the MCU like that. The movies are well made, and for the sake of the discussion, Ruffalo is always a highlight in those movies (namely Ragnarok and Endgame)."
1945,Intouchables- Great film!

2001,Kid-sized cigarette jokes... what a time to be alive
2002,splendid
2003,"How the fuck is Red Hot Riding Hood not in the  National  Film Registry?

I get other animated snubs  like Fritz, and The Pink Phink a but Why Red Hot Ridding hood?"
2004,"Yeah, whistling with his fingers and everything."
2005,"Not only that, but I didn't realize how closely this entire scene is referenced. The exterior of the club, rolling up in a stretch limo, the interior of the club, and the ways he reacts at the table (hitting himself with a hammer, whistling) are directly lifted from this."
2006,"King-size, actually. But still, cigarette-related jokes at all."
2007,Sometimes movies just don‚Äôt land for whatever reason. Shrug it off and move along. No need to dwell.
2008,"Funnily enough I did something similar and considered asking the same thing on here but figured being seen to step out of line with the critical consensus is just asking for trouble.

I watched Uncut Gems for example and found it unengaging and generally underwhelming and by its conclusion I was bored with watching a guy repeatedly make obvious apocalyptically bad mistakes.

But beyond that I‚Äôve felt the same thing that these films that get all the hype and plaudits are just not landing with me anymore. Not sure why. Perhaps my taste has changed. Perhaps being, for the most part, off social media (dumped Twitter, Insta and FB last year) has meant I‚Äôm not aware of some meta narrative behind the scenes that everyone else has been following to add more context to the plaudits. 

What ever it is, it seems to me that something has changed that I can‚Äôt put my finger on, either with myself or the way critical media hypes things and the consensus that builds around a property declaring it ‚ÄúBEST ThINg EvARrrr!‚Äù.

The net result either way now is that I tend to listen to opinions and if everyone goes in a single direction en masse I automatically drop my expectations by 50% 

I‚Äôve not seen Parasite yet and I‚Äôm hoping it will be good and I‚Äôm open to it being as amazing as everyone says but based on the past 12 months of ‚Äúmasterpieces‚Äù my expectations are currently middling."
2009,"I bought ad Astra because a number of people said that it was an epic space movie.
I was deeply disappointed. 

I no longer trust any of the film critics or recommendations. Like the irish man, i was so bored I turned it off. Their are other movies that were stated as good that I completely disagree with. I don't have a problem with someone liking or enjoying a movie that I don't. but when its stated as best movie of the year. I have a real problem with that."
2010,"Why does it matter what others think?

When you watch a movie, who are you watching for?  And why?

I'm not trying to be glib or put you on the spot.  You might be worried about what others think, you might be worried that you're not growing enough as a person...

If you can elaborate on these details, it would help us put our answers in a meaningful context."
2011,"Nope, there's definitely been a huge decline in the quality of movies over the past decade, that's not to say there aren't some gems hidden in there, I feel pretty much the same way you do, which is why I switched to Asian cinema, lots of high quality Korean and Japanese movies, especially if you haven't seen many"
2012,"Who said it was a great movie? Never heard that before

Regardless, I find that, especially for older movies, IMDB rating is most accurate to how good a movie is (unless you're one of those Canne film festival is true art kind of person). But even for modern films, I think the best films of the year (1917, Ford v Ferrari, Marriage Story, Parasite, Joker are consistently rated 8 or higher)"
2013,"Hard disagree. Paul Thomas Anderson, Tarantino, Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, Coen Brothers, Fincher, Bong Joon Ho, Spike Lee, Guillermo Del Toro, George Miller, Edgar Wright are all still as good as ever, then you have tons of new auteurs like The Safdie Brothers, Jordan Peele, Greta Gerwig, Ari Aster, Taika Waititi, Robert Eggers, Barry Jenkins, Damien Chazelle, Ryan Coogler, Denis Villeneuve, Alex Garland, and more 

Like, if you take all the films these people have made in the last 10 years, that‚Äôs a fuck load of great movies lol"
2014,"How did you cobble up all those names but forget Denis Villeneuve, lol"
2015,"Whoops, I put him on there but accidentally deleted him again, fixed!"
2016,The King of Comedy
2017,"Fight Club, 12 Monkeys, Memento, The Machinist, Talented Mr. Ripley, Seven, The Game, Donnie Darko, American Psycho, Fracture, Cape Fear, Requiem For A Dream"
2018,Bad Lieutenant
2019,"If you want bleak but brilliant I'd suggest ""Into the Void"" ""Prozac Nation"" and ""Requiem for a dream"", all hard to watch but excellent."
2020,"Zodiac

Se7en"
2021,"Night Crawler, Good Time, Willard (2003), No Country for old men, Drive"

2026,Would you add night crawler to that list?
2027,Nice list
2028,"All of these, but add Basic Instinct. That movie slaps. She is the perfect female psycho. It also doesn‚Äôt hurt how stunningly beautiful Sharon Stone is."
2029,I second this choice...also *Requiem for a Dream*.
2030,I would.
2031,Drive too?
2032,"Film taste is subjective. I greatly appreciate both actors but came away unmoved, theme that was empty, no feelings for the characters.  A film many will say it's arthouse, but empty to me also."
2033,"Just got out of it and thought it was tremendous. All I will say is that if you are the type of cinema goer who laps up the churned out Hollywood superhero, Rock films etc. You‚Äôll probably leave the cinema bored and wondering what went on, until you close your eyes at night to sleep and find yourself wondering what Thomas meant by, ‚Äòye should have never spilled yee beans lad!!‚Äô."
2034,"I keep getting down voted for saying the same thing, but I agree with you. It is pretentious and falls short."
2035,">Eggers has lost me as a fan

If I like a movie someone made and then don't like another movie they made why would this be my conclusion?"
2036,"It‚Äôs a good thing people have their pwn opinions, because I respectfully disagree with yours."
2037,"You can have any opinion you want, but if you present it with a title like that and then don't even put in the effort to write more than 3 and a bit lines of content, why should anyone take it seriously?  
What is your intention with something like this?  
The ""story"" moved with pretty much every scene of the film, what you mean is there wasn't much plot which is true. But also not a problem in and of itself, what the film was interested in was to up the stakes (and craziness/atmosphere) with every scene until it climaxes. If that didn't work for you, fine."
2038,"Hmm I just watched the Witch recently and loved it after my friend suggested it and the Lighthouse. Now I‚Äôm even more curious, I haven‚Äôt watched the Lighthouse yet."
2039,K
2040,"I think there's far more to the film's intentions than you've imagined.  I think it's a great film, made like a work of Art."
2041,"I really hope this won't be my experience. I've yet to watch it, but friend of mine with whom I tend to disagree a lot about films and who disliked The VVitch (somehow) has seen it, and said that he liked it."
2042,The film was not awful the film was amazing your mothers hand jobs are awful
2043,"I agree with it feeling empty

And i hate that when indie cinema sucks it is called arthouse. Nooo ive seen plenty of good arthouse movies"
2044,"its pretty polarizing because of the structure, pacing, and the ambiguity at the end. but all of that was very obviously intentional. it's top 2 movies of the year for me. it's definitely one you'll still be thinking about well after you've seen it."
2045,Buckets of human waste and dripping semen is considered arthouse these days.
2046,"Sounds great! Honestly the fact that it can be polarizing is already a very good sign for me. Two recent fairly polarizing movies that come to mind are Midsommar which I liked and the Suspiria remake which pretty much instantly became my favorite film ever.

I'll try to avoid getting any more information on it until I watch it."
2047,it may be intentional but intention is separate from enjoyment
2048,You're confusing Pornhub with Art House.
2049,"yea, thats why it's a polarizing movie. i found it brilliant, while the person i saw it with didn't like it."
2050,Actually the film director is confused.
2051,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/esvjmz/official_discussion_the_gentlemen_spoilers
2052,"Guy Ritchie's best crime film. Clever, funny, beautifully paced. Sharp performances from Grant, Hunnam and Farrell. The dialogue was so well done. A real love of language on display. The Gentlemen is a blast."
2053,Hugh Grant was great but The Gentlemen was no Snatch
2054,Snatch is the GOAT
2055,"Rango is a mashup of old westerns, Chinatown and The Road Warrior, which is a Mad Max movie from 1982, also a George Miller classic."
2056,Nicely considered. Good job.
2057,""" We don't take kindly to strangers round here""."
2058,Holy shit...they got Rango‚Äôd
2059,Both movies borrow heavily from the same (much older) movies.
2060,"""Furry Road""?

Great observations!

I've said a similar thing about Skyfall and Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows (seriously, they're the same film)

I love Rango, it's animation is on another level completely. Even recent Pixar releases (with the exception of possibly TS 4) can't match the level of character detail (and Rango is now 9 years old)."
2061,"I loved rango, can't say I felt the same about fury road"
2062,The visual comedy in Rango is great!
2063,I'm with you there.
2064,I'm with both of you.
2065,It's about a blue hedgehog that runs very fast. Didn't expect it to be a work of art. When it comes to movies like this all I really want to know if it's going to entertain my family of all ages when they to come visit me next week.
2066,"This is just one review. 

Amd this review couldn't be more snobby than it was. This guy is sad."
2067,"i miss gene shalit and other reviewers who will tell you to go see a stupid but fun movie, and just mention you should check your brain at the door first"
2068,"The argument that it‚Äôs a kid movie in defence of this movie‚Äôs quality doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Many kids films can hold up in quality for kids and adults alike.

I loved Sonic as a kid nonetheless so will probably see it."
2069,"Holy shit. He actually expected Sonic to be an Oscar film. I feel sorry for this guy's kids. 

What a pretentious-sounding reviewer. I'm still gonna watch it, it sounds fun. Others have praised it and I'm sure I'm gonna have a blast watching it. Some film reviewers are really fond of blowing hot air off their asses."
2070,"Wow, people are super defensive for this movie without even seeing it. Fast & Furious and similar stuff gets shit on because it's nothing more than ""dumb fun"", yet when Sonic does this, it's great? Alrighty then."
2071,"Of course it's not gonna rock. It's *Sonic the Hedgehog*, not fucking District 9. This film isn't going to be layered with subtext or a deeper meaning to analyze. It's a family film video game adaptation from a first time director. You can't seriously expect it to be award worthy.

Film's been getting decent reception from those who've seen it early. Fingers crossed it ends up being at least okay."
2072,No shit. It's Sonic.
2073,Is Jim Carrey at least funny enough to make the movie worth watching? Because that's honestly the only reason I want to go see it at all. I've been starving for more Jim Carrey doing his over the top Shtick for years.
2074,breaking news: paint-by-numbers nostalgia bait movie is generic
2075,"This was never going to be a ‚Äúgood‚Äù movie, even if they re-did the CGI so Sonic stop looking like your children‚Äôs sleep paralysis demon."
2076,Well this movie is definitely gonna do that.
2077,Yeah. movies are just like Pokemon. They're doing battles for the powerless peasantry who have no one else to defend them.
2078,I just love how the film starts and ends at the base of a tree.
2079,Really nice summary. Thank you for taking the time to put this together. One lone person on the inter webs appreciates it kindly.
2080,And then you add the insane work from roger deakins to make it one shot. The cinemaography is incredible in this movie.
2081,I was blown away when I watched this film. A true masterpiece.
2082,"I literally wept through half the film BOTH times that I saw it.

I wish so much that it had gotten more recognition."
2083,It‚Äôs ahead of its time.
2084,A film has never affected me in that way before. I can't stand that the film and Mendes weren't recognized more in the US.

Abstract: States adopt minimum wages to improve workers‚Äô economic circumstances and wellbeing. Many, but not all, studies find evidence of health benefits from higher minimum wages. This study used a rigorous ‚Äútriple difference‚Äù strategy to identify the associations between state minimum wages and adult obesity, body mass index (kg/m2), hypertension, diabetes, fair or poor health, and serious psychological distress. National Health Interview Survey data (2008‚Äì2015) on adults ages 25-64 (n = 131,430) were linked to state policies to estimate the prevalence odds ratio or mean difference in these outcomes associated with a $1 increase in current and two-year lagged minimum wage among less-educated adults overall and by gender, race/ethnicity, and age. In contrast to prior studies, there was no association between current minimum wage and health; however, two-year lagged minimum wage was positively associated with the likelihood of obesity (prevalence odds ratio: 1.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.16) and with elevated body mass index (mean difference: 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.04, 0.49). In subgroup models, current and two-year lagged minimum wage were associated with a higher likelihood of obesity among male and non-White or Hispanic adults. The associations with hypertension also varied by gender and the timing of the exposure."

Authors: Laurent Bouton, Paola Conconi, Francisco Pino, and Maurizio Zanardi

Journal: Review of Economics & Statistics *(Forthcoming; Posted Online Jan 23, 2020)*

Abstract: We study how electoral incentives affect policy choices on secondary issues, which only minorities of voters care intensely about. We develop a model in which office and policy motivated politicians vote in favor [of] or against regulations on these issues. We derive conditions under which politicians flip flop, voting according to their policy preferences at the beginning of their terms, but in line with the preferences of single-issue minorities as they approach re-election. To assess the evidence, we study U.S. senators' votes on gun control, environment, and reproductive rights. In line with the model's predictions, we find that i) election proximity has a pro-gun effect on Democratic senators and a pro-environment effect on Republican senators; these effects arise for senators who ii) are not retiring, iii) do not hold safe seats, and iv) represent states where the single-issue minority is of intermediate size. Also in line with our theory, election proximity does not affect votes on reproductive rights, due to the presence of single-issue minorities on both sides.

6,"The write-up misses the main point of the article, which has to do with the spatial and temporal statistical nature of singling in the neocortex during 'consciousness'. The stimulation is a way to drive the particular frequency (50Hz) across cortical regions. The idea that the thalamus supports wakefulness and sleep is not new, nor is the idea that stimulation can wake up an animal. For instance, you can get a partial awakening with tactile stimulation (pinch). Nurses use the sternal rub to arouse people. This information goes through that thalamus before the cortex. The thalamus is involved in consciousness like a router is involved in the internet - a necessary relay, but not the source of content."

33,"> ""Specific to heterosexual relationships, girls may use more violence on their boyfriends to try to solve their relational problems, while boys may try to constrain their aggressive impulses when trying to negotiate discord with their girlfriends,"" said Sameer Hinduja, Ph.D., lead author and a professor in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice within FAU's College for Design and Social Inquiry, and co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center. ""It's unfortunate to be thinking about dating abuse as we approach one of the most romantic days of the year, Valentine's Day. However, it is clear that digital dating abuse affects a meaningful proportion of teenagers, and we need to model and educate youth on what constitutes a healthy, stable relationship and what betrays a dysfunctional, problematic one."" 

Considering that women have been found to be equally aggressive towards their male partners or even more aggressive (there's not enough research to say which it is yet), it makes sense that males will get the brunt of it. 


> Results of the study, published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, showed that more than one-quarter (28.1 percent) of teens who had been in a romantic relationship at some point in the previous year said they had been the victim of at least one form of digital dating abuse. These included: whether their significant other looked through the contents of their device without permission; kept them from using their device; threatened them via text; posted something publicly online to make fun of, threaten, or embarrass them; and posted or shared a private picture of them without permission.

> In addition, more than one-third (35.9 percent) had been the victim at least one form of traditional (offline) dating abuse (i.e., they were pushed, grabbed or shoved; hit or threatened to be hit; called names or criticized, or prevented from doing something they wanted to do).

> Interestingly, males were significantly more likely to have experienced digital dating abuse (32.3 percent) compared to females (23.6 percent), and more likely to experience all types of digital dating abuse, and were even more likely to experience physical aggression. No other differences emerged with respect to demographic characteristics such as sexual orientation, race and age. 

Female aggression is normally believed to be less physical than male aggression by researchers, so this certainly is an interesting result."
34,"As the parent to a 15 year old girl, I can attest to this being the wild-f-ing-west when it comes to the integration of tech into their lives. I can't say I've seen her be abusive to her romantic interests online, but I've definitely seen it pointed at her. There is so much happening online with this generation that we dumb ass X'ers are not aware of that it would be amusing were it not terrifying. Things happen instantly with them, and the effects of those instantaneous actions can go across an entire school within literally ~~5 minutes~~ seconds. In that time, if you ask the kid involved, their lives can ""be ruined"".

Dating, in particular, is an entirely different ballgame from when I was in HS. You have a disagreement at school with your bf/gf? Gotta wait till you can get phone permission to continue it, or table it until the next day - when cooler heads prevail. Now? You're always in touch (until the parents shut the phone down for the day) so those interactions are constant and ever changing. And when they go sideways, they go very, very sideways. Their texted conversations under duress are brutal because they're not looking at each other face to face. 

Anyone that has ever parented a young teenage girl knows firsthand how f-ing crazy those people are emotionally. I have little doubt that she's lashed out at a boy that she feels treated her in a way she didn't appreciate and I can only imagine what that lashing out entailed. Again - it's the instant-access that social media allows that is the issue here. There is no 'cooling off' period and it's 24/7

It sucks for kids today. Tech hasn't made their lives easier. IMHO, its made it harder, and its made them far more susceptible to damage from peers."
35,"Also studies on violence in relationships show that men are the victim more often.

What saddens me about it, and tell me if you feel otherwise, is that it appears to be seen less of a problem if men are the victims than if something happens to women.

Especially for young boys today that must be devastating. And I would not be surprised if it was one of the reasons why boys commit suicide 4 times more often than girls."

No sources available to explore this though."
43,"Or we could teach everyone how to respect each other on a relationship.  Boys have been hearing it for years, now we have to start telling the girls as well."
44,From the article I gather that would be girls.
45,"> Interestingly, males were significantly more likely to have experienced digital dating abuse (32.3 percent) compared to females (23.6 percent), and more likely to experience all types of digital dating abuse, and were even more likely to experience physical aggression.

I was confirming that anecdotally you are right. I run a support service for men and have had many victims of DV disclose a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.

This is partly due to them being denied care and harmful interventions by the police and child protection services, due to the men being the presumed perpetrators.

My country has about 600 make success each year. There are on average 10 adult male and 14 adult female family violence deaths. 

I'm claiming that there are at least 24 men killing themselves annually due to being the victim of DV, with that being about 5 percent of annual suicide deaths. Seems very likely to me."

>Abstract
>	Strategies to reduce, halt, and reverse global declines in marine biodiversity are needed urgently. We reviewed, coded, and synthesized historical and contemporary marine conservation strategies of the Kitasoo/Xai‚Äôxais First Nation in British Columbia, Canada to show how their approaches work. We assessed whether the conservation actions classification system by the Conservation Measures Partnership was able to encompass this nation‚Äôs conservation approaches. All first‚Äêorder conservation actions aligned with the Kitasoo/Xai‚Äôxais First Nation‚Äôs historical and contemporary marine conservation actions; hereditary chief management responsibility played a key role. A conservation ethic permeates Kitasoo/Xai‚Äôxais culture, and indigenous resource management and conservation existed historically and remains strong despite extreme efforts by colonizers to suppress all indigenous practices. The Kitasoo/Xai‚Äôxais‚Äôs embodiment of conservation actions as part of their worldview, rather than as requiring actions separate from everyday life (the norm in nonindigenous cultures), was missing from the conservation action classification system. The Kitasoo/Xai‚Äôxais are one of many indigenous peoples working to revitalize their governance and management authorities. With the Canadian government‚Äôs declared willingness to work toward reconciliation, there is an opportunity to enable First Nations to lead on marine and other conservation efforts. Global conservation efforts would also benefit from enhanced support for indigenous conservation approaches, including expanding the conservation actions classification to encompass a new category of conservation or sacredness ethic."

And different religions focus on different moral axes:  Haredi Judaism focuses on sanctity and loyalty, whereas Quakerism on care and liberty.

There's a extensive literature about disgust, the ""behavioral immune system"", and its relation to politics, though less on Purity-axis religious morality.

Many atheists/agnostics rate high on the care, fairness and liberty axes. The nature of their (*our*) self-selection means that in more religious nations they (*we*) aren't representative of the general population on the authority and loyalty axes. They become blind spots (to the extent I have difficulty comprehending them as moral axes at all).

>This study finds that the online ‚Äúfake news‚Äù game,¬†*Bad News*,¬†can confer psychological resistance against common online misinformation  strategies across different cultures. The intervention draws on the  theory of psychological inoculation:¬†analogous to the process of medical  immunization, we find that ‚Äúprebunking,‚Äù or preemptively warning and  exposing people to weakened doses of misinformation, can help cultivate  ‚Äúmental antibodies‚Äù against fake news. We conclude that social impact  games rooted in basic insights from social psychology can boost immunity  against misinformation across a variety of cultural, linguistic, and  political settings.

# Questions about inferring causation from the data:

1. Was this a pre-post design (in which everyone receives the ‚Äútreatment‚Äù and there is no random assignment to a control group) or a randomized controlled design (randomly assigning people to a ‚Äútreatment‚Äù and ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù condition)?
2. If this is pre-post rather than randomized, then can one conclude that the game can ‚Äúconfer"", ""help"", or ""boost"" anything?
3. If we cannot infer such causation, then what can we infer instead?"
66,"My biggest issue is not the pre-post design, but that they ignore basic tenants of learning and skill acquisition literature.

>We showed participants (*n*= 134 to¬†*n*= 379 for the full pre-post survey) 3 fake and 3 credible (control) Twitter posts before and after playing the game and asked them to rate their reliability on a 1-7 Likert scale

There are transient practice and true learning effects. Transient effects of practice influence measurements immediately after practice but then fade. We don't know from this study if these effects persist into the future when reading fake news. If not, then we'd have to play a game before reading the news everyday. They need to conduct a transfer test to understand how ingrained these results are to participant reading/understanding strategies."

What are the threats to validity here and plausible third variables? Time is unlikely as this was asynchronous. They did control for individual level variables (education, gender, politics). Pre-post isn't great but I don't think this is worthless either...

They note ""randomized trials with the English version of the game have been conducted (Basol et al., 2020), highlighting similar results across diverse groups (Basol et al., 2020)."" So the new information here may be that a study conducted across many nationalities (Swedish, German, Greek, and Polish) is consistent with randomized trials. Not as ideal as a randomized international set of trials, but still some level of value in a world of research where money is a real constraint on any study."

> A major challenge college students face is retaining the knowledge they acquire in their classes, especially in cumulative disciplines such as engineering, where ultimate success depends on long-term retention of foundational content. Cognitive psychologists have recently recommended various techniques educators might use to increase retention. One technique ( spaced retrieval practice) involves extending opportunities to retrieve course content beyond a customarily short temporal window following initial learning. Confirming the technique's utility requires demonstrating that it increases retention in real classroom settings, with commonly encountered educational content, and that gains endure into subsequent semesters. We manipulated spaced versus massed retrieval practice in a precalculus course for engineering students and followed a subset of students who proceeded into a calculus class the following semester. Spacing versus massing was manipulated within- and between-subjects. Within-subjects, students retained spaced content better than massed content in the precalculus course. Between-subjects, students for whom some retrieval practice was spaced, compared to those for whom all practice was massed, performed better on the final exam in the precalculus class and on exams in the calculus class. These findings suggest that spaced retrieval practice can have a meaningful, long-lasting impact on educational outcomes."

82,Globally or in one particular country?
83,"The public has long thought that handguns are more responsible for human deaths, including suicides, than long guns such as rifles and shotguns, which have been believed to be more commonly used for hunting or protection from wild animals. But now, in an analysis of data from 16 years of gun suicides in Maryland, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers found that long guns were used more often in suicides by kids and teens than by adults, and were more commonly used in suicide by people in rural counties.

The researchers say their findings, published Feb. 3 in Injury Epidemiology, suggest that adopting safety measures for rifles or shotguns may prevent suicides, particularly among young people and rural-area residents.

‚ÄúOur goal as clinicians at Johns Hopkins Medicine is to save lives, and it‚Äôs concerning to see that it‚Äôs not just handguns, but long guns that are used commonly in youth suicide,‚Äù says Paul Nestadt, M.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ‚ÄúMany of the safety protections that we have in place around the country typically don‚Äôt apply to long guns, and the data suggest that our strategy needs to be modified.‚Äù
In many states, there is no minimum age for owning long guns, and federal background checks are only required if buying from a licensed gun dealer. Requirements for permits and safety courses for rifles vary from state to state.

All these factors would benefit their ‚Äúfindings‚Äù aka what their bias would be.

Controlled burns take a ton of prep time, on the ground work and crossing of fingers the weather cooperates on the day of the burn. It's not possible to do controlled burns in an unmaintained eucalyptus grove understory, it requires hundreds of man hours prepping, removing lower limbs, hauling the cut brush and chipping it. 

There's also the issue of liability and jumping containment. You need permission to do burns on private lands and there will always be pushback from the community from an air quality perspective.

There are also environmental concerns. You have to make sure you aren't burning sensitive habitat or causing mass ecological damage. 

Then there is the whole timing aspect. You have to schedule crews and set the burn timeframe weeks, if not months in advance. If the weather doesn't cooperate, you're screwed and it's a pile of public moneys down the drain.

Most agencies and governments aren't against controlled burns as some deflection of climate change, it's just a really difficult and costly approach to mitigating fire risk. 

A much more effective method that is less labor intensive is to create shaded fuel breaks, keep grasses down, allow burn piles and force property owners to maintain and clear an effective defensible space area. 

The reality is that government is never going to have the resources or ability to mitigate fire risk in communities, with or without climate change. Private property owners have to step up and work together to make safer communities and understand just how much needs to be cleared to make their properties safe."

> In the 1990s, prominent biologists and journalists predicted that by 2020 each of us would carry a genome card, which would allow physicians to access our entire genome sequence and routinely use this information to diagnose and treat common and debilitating conditions. This is not yet the case. Why not? Common and debilitating diseases are rarely caused by single-gene mutations, and this was recognized before these genome card predictions had been made. Debilitating conditions, including common psychiatric disorders, are typically caused either by rare mutations or by complex interactions of many genes, each having a small effect, and epigenetic, environmental, and microbial factors. In such cases, having a complete genome sequence may have limited utility in diagnosis and treatment. Genome sequencing technologies have transformed biological research in many ways, but had a much smaller effect than expected on treatments of common diseases. Thus, early proponents of genome sequencing effectively ‚Äúmis-promised‚Äù its benefits. One reason may be that there are incentives for both biologists and journalists to tell simple stories, including the idea of relatively simple genetic causation of common, debilitating diseases. These incentives may have led to misleading predictions, which to some extent continue today. Although the Human Genome Project has facilitated biological research generally, the mis-promising of medical benefits, at least for treating common and debilitating disorders, could undermine support for scientific research over the long term."

165,"Thought this spacex email was relevant as it addresses similar points. 

There is a creeping tendency to use made up acronyms at SpaceX. Excessive use of made up acronyms is a significant impediment to communication and keeping communication good as we grow is incredibly important. Individually, a few acronyms here and there may not seem so bad, but if a thousand people are making these up, over time the result will be a huge glossary that we have to issue to new employees. No one can actually remember all these acronyms and people don't want to seem dumb in a meeting, so they just sit there in ignorance. This is particularly tough on new employees.

That needs to stop immediately or I will take drastic action - I have given enough warning over the years. Unless an acronym is approved by me, it should not enter the SpaceX glossary. If there is an existing acronym that cannot reasonably be justified, it should be eliminated, as I have requested in the past.

For example, there should be not ""HTS"" [horizontal test stand] or ""VTS"" [vertical test stand] designations for test stands. Those are particularly dumb, as they contain unnecessary words. A ""stand"" at our test site is obviously a test stand. VTS-3 is four syllables compared with ""Tripod"", which is two, so the bloody acronym version actually takes longer to say than the name!

The key test for an acronym is to ask whether it helps or hurts communication. An acronym that most engineers outside of SpaceX already know, such as GUI, is fine to use. It is also ok to make up a few acronyms/contractions every now and again, assuming I have approved them, e.g. MVac and M9 instead of Merlin 1C-Vacuum or Merlin 1C-Sea Level, but those need to be kept to a minimum."

182,"I'm not sure this is totally a bad thing. The jargon is often a word with a discreet meaning that needs to be discrete because it's a complicated subject with similar terms that need to not be confused with each other. It is very easy to get a definition, and if that definition contains jargon then it is easy to drill further down until it is understandable.

Someone confused over something like 'inflammable', and unwilling to check the meaning, should simply not be involved with anything inflammable. It may be safest in that instance that they were disinterested, and by not wanting to check the meaning they almost ARE bad at science. I mean, it is the essence of finding out things you don't know after all..."

There is a purpose and an audience when journals are written. Their purpose is for scientists to understand extremely complex topics and data and information about the most extreme depths of a subject. To explain and write a paper about a certain particular polymer chemistry for example requires a ridiculous amount of complex term and complex arguments. This is not jargon even though 80% of people could not read it.

From when I started school years ago there is no possible way I could understand the large majority of academic papers but further into my degree I gained more and more confidence and understanding specialized to my field.  

As others have pointed out you cannot conflate academic journals and science journalism. There is a clear distinction between both."

From there, you get a Greta Thunberg saying, ""Listen to the guys who know what they're doing.""

201,"When I was in college and looking for research jobs on campus through our schools database of active labs, I was amazed at all of the incredibly specific and niche types of research that were being done in one university. Pretty much all large universities have this kind of database you can google and find. The lab I ended up working for was doing research on the auditory cortex and its link to memory and how music neurologically stimulates the brains of animals. It‚Äôs sad to think about how little awareness and interest there is of all work being done by the scientists of today - a lot of it due to the intimidating jargon preventing people from learning more about what they are doing.

I also worked in science journalism for a quantum physics lab and it really is a huge challenge trying to break down complex information and work around the jargon in a way for a general audience to understand."

203,"I teach emergency medicine and this is a big problem for students with no medical background. Standardized testing, for example, uses words like hypoxemia or cyanosis when the common meaning is that there's low oxygen in the blood or that the skin is blue. A student who may know exactly how to fix said problem in plain English may have a tough time when they aren't well versed in the vocabulary.

I find that a lot of students struggle through topics significantly less when they have a good understanding of the jargon involved. I have even unofficially tested this by looking at the scores of quizzes written in jargon versus those written in plain English.

As a result, I periodically ask my students to explain medical concepts in simple terms. I find that those who can do this well tend to have significantly higher rates of first time passing in both the course and their certification exams."
204,"As a critique of the study, the way they offered definitions of the jargon was by having readers mouse over the confusing words. I think that's actually a bad way to do it, and may contribute to readers feeling alienated.

When I write for a non-scientific audience and need to use jargon from my field, I define it as best as I can within the text just before or after introducing the word.

If the word is introduced in the text itself, it's part of the flow and invites the reader to learn the jargon. When the reader has to mouse over it, that forces them to acknowledge that they don't know the word (which is frustrating) and breaks up the flow of reading.

I would be interested in a follow-up study where a piece of jargon is introduced in a more natural way vs the method they used here."

229,"As I've always been told, the moment that you as a researcher use the phrase ""dumb it down"", it's because you yourself don't understand the topic/work enough to explain it to the current audience. If you truly understand something, your explanations should be an ever evolving dance flowing from complex to common comparison laden to offer applicability to the unexposed dependent upon your audience. While people do have a propensity to doing and saying stupid things, the truth is that almost all people have the capacity to understand and learn if something is presented properly. Whenever possible, dont shift the blame to the audience, instead look at how to better relate your work to others.

However, in certain publications, it's important to use all the correct terminology. If I'm reading a publication in JBC and someone writes ""this protein has a sugar on it"", that's not good enough. Is it a GAG, is it an N- or O-glycan, complex or hybrid or high mannose? There is a place for proper jargon and terminology, not everything can or should be made coherent to someone not exposed to the field because at a certain point too many details get thinned out if substitutes that are more common are used. It's important to maintain a balance and to present properly to the audience. I wouldn't expect non-research oriented person to like many methodology papers, but that's not their purpose and someone shouldn't read those as a general application to science. That's what Nature and Science papers are for, big science and generally very good science for a wide audience. If interest is piqued then go into specific journals of target fields like journal of biological chemistry or journal of cell biology."

Nothing there implies that the article is trying to censor anything. It's not talking about writing intended for peer review."

276,"I'll weigh-in as someone who wrote articles in science, health, space and technology for more than a handful of years.

I had an editor sending me about 8-9 new studies a day I had to attempt my best to read, understand what they're claiming, and find a way to make a 300 word article about it so it would show up in SEO on Google. It was not easy jumping from cell cancer research to a new quasar discovered to a new Samsung patent all in just a few hours.

You're 100% right, there is no way I could have attempted to truly understand what I was writing about, I was having to wrap my mind around months to years of research in a matter of an hour or so, then attempt my best to translate what I learned to the public. 

The alternative, though, is I also wrote about a lot of research that was never picked up by other news outlets. So our ability to produce high volumes like that is a bit of a catch 22 in that it makes it difficult for journalistic quality control, but also helped highlight research that no one else may have even care to write about. Weird seeing the bee colony collapses take headlines when I was writing about those studies more than a decade ago."
277,Scientists often dont realize how smart they are being.
278,"I agree with you. And while I don't doubt the findings of the study I'm not so sure the answer is to stop using jargon in science journalism altogether. Certainly there is a market for a more accessible and easily understood way to connect with what's going on in the science world and I think that should stay (and improve), but to me what this study really highlights is that the average reaction to something people don't understand right away is negative. We should be trying to figure out why that is and trying to find ways to encourage people to do research more often when they don't understand something. It's okay to not understand something! That is just an opportunity to learn something new. And to be clear I'm not advocating that everyone spend all of their free time researching science. But if someone was interested in a topic enough to read an article but didn't understand a few terms then use that interest as motivation to learn."

Sure. Are you offering to chip in for salary?"

Yes. You start by having a healthy consumer market for paid journalism comprised of customers who are willing to pay a premium for well written science content. Then you pay a premium wage to attract top talent who will produce that content for you. If there is more demand for content, you hire more journalists. 

The problem is that everyone wants high quality content but few are willing to pay for it. So you get stuck with clickbait science journalism because that‚Äôs what actually pays."
281,"I made this point elsewhere. If we dumb down scientific journalism to appeal to folks who dont want to put in the effort to learn the terms and learn about the subject, then whats the point? Theyre not there to learn, theyre there to be entertained. Which is fine enough, but thats not the goal of most scientific journals- the goal is to educate. If were dumbing down to the point where its no longer educational or even true is some cases, why bother?

And this isnt calling people stupid. Anyone could learn this stuff if they wanted to. And its fine that people dont want to. But leave the true learning for people who actually are invested in learning it.


Eta: its like steak. Some people eat their steak gray and dry with ketchup and all kinds of seasonings, and do so with relatively expensive cuts. Thats fine- but that means that youre not a person who really likes steak and youre wasting your time and momey consuming a ""higher quality"" product in such a transformational way, you know?

It sounds elitist but it really isnt. Theres no real barrier to entry to science other than desire to learn. Anyone can learn and enjoy different branches of science if they chose and no ones going to stop them"

Kids loved it! I had numerous questions from kids that were interested in science.

289,"That being said, outside of sciences some organizations do use a completely made-up jargon to obfuscate things. I'm French, and our Ministry of Education is infamous in this regard."
290,"As a scientist, I politely disagree. When you‚Äôre writing in a high level journal like Nature, Science, PNAS, etc, scientists in other disciplines might want to read your work. If it‚Äôs full of jargon, they‚Äôll probably lose interest (I do). 

For example, I have a paper coming out about where insects wings came from, where I use as little jargon as possible: Insects evolved from crustaceans, so one theory is that wings evolved from side lobes on the proximal part of crustacean legs, for example gills or the plates that cover the gills. Another theory is that insect wings grew out of the back, and did not evolve from any structure in crustaceans . I used CRISPR cas9 genetic engineering to knock out leg patterning genes in a crustacean, then compared my results to previously published results in insects. I found that the legs of crustaceans and insects can be aligned in a one to one fashion. However, crustaceans have two additional proximal leg segments relative to insects, which suggested that insects had incorporated these two leg segments into their body wall. So I compared the expression patterns of two other genes, and found that they are expressed in the proximal leg of my crustacean but in the body wall of insects. Therefore, it appears that insects incorporated two ancestral leg segments into the body wall, which moved the lobes (gills or plates) up into the back to later form insects wings. 

You and everyone reading this likely understood everything I just said.  But if instead I had written the following, it would be correct, but even people in my lab who work on slightly different things would have trouble understanding it. But I‚Äôm generally very anti jargon, because I don‚Äôt want my audience to be tripping over new jargon even for a millisecond, which might make them miss important components of my line of reasoning, which then might make them dismiss my ideas or not fully understand them. 


Insects evolved from crustaceans. The paranotal theory proposes that insect wings evolved from paranotal lobes, while the exite theory proposes that wings evolved from crustacean exites. I used CRISPR cas9 to knock out five leg gap genes in the amphipod crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, and compared my results to previously published functional studies in insects. I found that the distal six podomeres of crustaceans and insects are homologous. However, the crustacean precoxa and coxa are not accounted for in insects, which suggested that these two ancestral podomeres now form the pleurites of the insects pleuron . I compared the expression patterns of genes expressed in the Drosophila notum , and found that they are expressed in the precoxa and coxa of Parhyale but in the pleuron of Tribolium. Therefore, it appears that insects incorporated two ancestral podomeres into the pleuron, which moved the exites dorsally to later form insects wings."
291,"The use of jargon simplifies speech when the audience is well versed in the matter but it makes it practicaly impossible for someone who doesn't know the meaning to understand. You can be scientifically accurate without using jargon. At the very least, the jargon should be explained to the audience in an introductory section."

297,"Yeah, I totally agree with most of the commenters here that specialists need their special words, but the field of economics is a very different case versus a field like physics.

Economics is such a necessarily political field that it's crucial that we all discuss and debate it. And economics actually had a long period of being fairly intelligible to a literate reader, but jargon and maths have penetrated the field over the last few decades in a similar way that Latin became the written language of the Catholic Church. And this change hasn't made it any more scientific or accurate as the harder sciences it is clearly attempting to ape. The result, in mediaeval religion and in modern economics is the same: laymen are fenced off from the debate, whether that result is accidental or intended (I suspect a bit of both)."

308,">I'm not a scientist. not that big into politics either but i know enough jargon to not feel dumb when reading the topics.

That depends on what you're reading. For real technical journals, there will always be jargon you don't know if it's not your field. You don't know enough jargon to really understand them. You can't know all the jargon.

Now, the feeling dumb part is as much or more about your response to realizing you don't know something as it is about not knowing something. That is, realizing you don't know something doesn't mean you're dumb or should feel you are dumb."
309,"Did you even read the article?

It matters because the public is increasingly uninformed and disinterested in topics when those topics are communicated using language they don't understand. It's pretty simple, really.

There's a serious need for honest and knowledgeable people who can write about these topics to bridge that gap."

‚ÄúYou can see how important it is to communicate clearly when you‚Äôre talking about complex science subjects like climate change or vaccines.‚Äù

If you start using extremely specific terms, define them when you first use them.  For example even if I use a really basic engineering term like ""duty cycle,"" I will give a 1/2 sentence definition of how I'm using it which costs me almost nothing and prevents my reader from having to open a tab to a dictionary and break their whole train of thought.

If people want to read about science they should be ready to actually learn a little bit, and that includes getting familiar with the terminology and concepts.
A lot of science journalism reduces concepts to the point where the title is essentially all you need to understand.

Naturally, you can also use jargon unnecessarily, as in your second example, where colloquial language already possesses sufficient precision to describe and disambiguate your statement.  This should be avoided for accessibility's sake.  Depending on your field, some jargon may be more or less necessary - in maths, you get used to papers being composed entirely of jargon because the alternative is either saying nothing of use or including entire textbooks in your papers - but there will certainly still be many cases where there is no reasonable alternative but to use jargon."

Its not that the writing changed its that the field did, as better methods became available where the theory and postulation can actually be tested much more rigorously.

Its the Field moving from a soft social science like psychology towards a hard science like physics (it likely won't end up there but will likely end up more maths and data heavy then many hard sciences), where the field is almost entirely maths, data, and models.

391,"IMO, it is a good idea to keep articles between 500-1000 words, explaining the thing in general terms, then provide a link to a more detailed news article about the thing, and another link to the actual article. 

Because 90% of people will just read the basic thing (and if it takes over 3-5 minutes to read with relatively little knowledge of the subject, people will just stop), 9.9% will go to the more detailed article (maybe 30 minute read) and if lucky, 0.1% of the readers will go into the actual science behind it. 

It's simple, cause most people have basic knowledge and are curious, but overestimate their intelligence (I definitely do) and think they're stupid if they can't understand a few words. Then the minority have some knowledge and know they aren't that knowledgeable about this thing, but want to learn and because of that will spend time to educate themselves. 

Then there are the people that actually understand what's being said. And they want to learn because it might help them in their fields. And they are the ones reading the actual science behind the articles.

So to do good science journalism, you cannot just have a science journalist. You need to have a physics journalist and an astronomy journalist and a medical journalist and a chemistry journalist, et cetera. But most places won't even hire a general science journalist."

That is to say, we have a huge problem of teachers being years if not decades behind the latest and greatest in educational practice because the last time they got any sort of educational theory was in college (and even that was probably seriously diluted).  If we want teachers who may only have a bachelor's degree to use the latest and greatest out of educational research, then the research article itself has to be written for the lay teacher in mind."

Personally that‚Äôs more depends on the subject matter to me."
403,"Many people in academic/scientific fields are self-important and come up with ""novel"" language as a way of creating a moat that establishes and protects their disciplinary ""supremacy."" So a significant amount of jargon is pointless beyond erecting protective silos for academic status strivers and tryhards."
404,"Yeah, that's the exact point they're making. Just because you're being precise, accurate, and careful doesn't make it automatically unreadable. You do realize that coherent, easily digested writing is a skill right? And that most researchers aren't interested or motivated to put the extra work required to polish their results so that they're easily digested.

Edit: seems like this is controversial.

Let's suppose there are two ways you can rate a paper: how technical it is, and how readable it is. 

Obviously, the more technical a paper is the harder it is to read.

Obviously, how readable a paper is determines how large the audience capable of reading it is, how quickly all readers of the paper can understand and digest its contents, and the less likely mistakes and misunderstandings are going to be hidden in the paper or taken by the reader.

Now the implication of the first goal is ""the less readable a paper is, the more technical it is"". Obviously, this is false, because you can make anything unreadable. 

Therefore, if a paper is unreadable, then you can't say that it's unreadable simply because it's technically complex. It could simply be because the author is a bad writer, and considering the demographics of the kind of people that write these papers, that seems very likely. Therefore, since there's ""extra unreadability"" that's not inherent to the subject matter, it should be possible to teach the author better ways of writing so that there's as few barriers to understanding the actually hard parts of the paper as possible.

I'm not advocating for papers to be written at a fifth grade level. That would be stupid. I'm instead saying that there's a cultural problem with academic writing, where the clarity of what's being said is not seen as important. To rectify this, I think that people should start talking about the problem, and people need to start paying attention to not only the content of papers but also how effectively that content is delivered. 

If papers as a whole became more readable, it's pretty unlikely that the average layman would find it easy to read them. However, for educated people, expanding the range of papers that can be read would be extremely useful. The kinds of people that would benefit from more readable papers include scientists in the same field as the paper, scientists outside the papers field, hobbyists, and proffessionals. Making papers more readable improves the understanding of everyone who reads the paper, including the intended audience of professional scientists well versed in the papers field."
405,"It's main audience may be people in the field, but there are also people new to the field that want to enter it. And more and more research requires mixed competences, so if you can attract a broader audience that should be a good thing. So whenever the conciseness is not strictly needed, it's good to avoid it in my opinion.

I replaced almost every single ""novel"" in my latest article with ""new"" because my colleague just had the habit of using ""novel"" when writing articles. Because it just sounded silly, and wasn't very concise either. I only left novel when talking about our own ""novel technique"" to highlight what was our contribution."
406,"I would argue *most* research papers are straight up poorly written, because many times there is clearly no intention whatsoever to explain the information in a reasonable fashion. 

They use needlessly technical terms when they *aren't* necessary. The papers are littered with pointlessly complex grammatical structure. Often times they use triple the amount of words necessary to explain certain subjects, while completely glossing over others, when in the context of the paper both should be equally prioritized.

Its just bad writing. They depend on the density and complexity to convince others that its not *bad*, rather, they're just too dumb to understand. 

But someone who actually understands what you're talking about can easily see where you had the opportunity to use better, more efficient phrasing, yet chose to go for heavy jargon instead to convince people you're more legit or whatever. 

The fact it actually works though is the sad part honestly."
407,"I can tell you for a fact that there is an incentive for researchers to write more terse, jargon-filled papers. The less easy it is to understand a paper, the more likely reviewers are to gloss over it and consider it strong. After all, if the math is so complex and involved that it'd take you, a seasoned researcher, days to parse it, it must be a good paper, right?

425,"Yes, making the term more generally understandable - even at the loss of accuracy - is the point.

&#x200B;

Many people, in the example of surgical robots, may not totally internalize the precision required in some fine surgeries. You're just cutting open someone and sewing them back up, why do you have to be that careful?

The term ""motion scaling"" in the example is probably the most insidious one - in my experience (as a college science instructor) students have a big issue with the idea of ""scaling"". I can't imagine the general public. It's a word that doesn't seem like jargon, but really is. They're thinking bathroom scale, not map scale."
426,">Are journals not for people involved in a field?

Yes? Did anyone say otherwise? Or even mentioned the use of jargon in journals specifically?

Neither? It's about how laypeople react to articles that use jargon. Did you read it?

What does this have to do with anything?"
427,"The findings or exploratory subject of the science is the new thing. The technical jargon being the new words used to succinctly and accuratly describe it. Lay friendly language being the ""old words"".

428,"The second form of the paragraph also contains significantly more nuance e.g. The result applies to two specific species, whist the first refers to insects and crustaceans broadly.

That is a significant difference in meaning and has an impact on interpretation."

431,You think he read the article? That's pretty generous.
432,"Maybe there should be two versions of each article, one for those in the know and one for those who aren‚Äôt familiar with the subject matter, like how medical websites have pages aimed at doctors and clinicians, and pages aimed at patients."
433,"I don't even think it's a trend. The common person has never been interested in the topic other than superficially. Hell, I studied medical history in the early 20th and doctors back then we're also lamenting the lack of interest by the masses in science and the over-interest iin pseudosciences."
434,Exactly; it's not a specialist's fault if some thicko doesn't understand long words & couldn't be bothered to go educate themselves. What they term jargon in this report are words used to explicitly reduce jargon by virtue of their specific meaning.
435,"Exactly.  It‚Äôs not intentionally gatekeeping, but specific terms mean specific things, and ‚Äúlayman‚Äù substitutions might require a paragraph or more of explanation, which people may not have room for (or if the do, the length will throw off readers as much as the jargon)"
436,And sometimes the same term might mean something completely different depending on the field or situation.

441,"I‚Äôm a nurse and there is a huge push now for physician notes to be easily accessible to the patient online. It sounds great because it offers transparency, but it‚Äôs definitely caused some ‚Äúnote bloat‚Äù as doctors try to write for a larger audience. Patients can track their chart online, so some of them are sitting in their hospital bed on their phone and basically keeping up in real time. Then they call me in and ask me to translate. After discussing it they‚Äôll say ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt he just write this in plain English so I can understand it?‚Äù Well, because the words mean specific things. ‚ÄúGross drainage‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to cut it in the medical world. 

I think patients should have access to their records and the things that are being said about them for sure, but there needs to be a way for professionals to communicate as accurately as possible. I‚Äôd be happy If there was a way to ‚Äúlock‚Äù notes until discussed with a doctor or nurse perhaps? And there still needs to be a ‚Äúsensitive note‚Äù option for scenarios like suspected abuse where we don‚Äôt want the caregiver to potentially have access until the appropriate people can be be called in.

I've found that can often be true when it comes to people who might be very good at mathematics / computer programing / algorithmic thinking. It's true to some degree for myself (it doesn't help that I'm dyslexic), I can read something technical and not get it first time, then once I do get it I think ""wait a minute couldn't you have just said x,y,z instead"".

One of the best technical writers I know comes from a humble working class background. Why I don't know perhaps they weren't brought-up to use pompous language or had to communicate their work with family members who weren't well educated...

454,Where should a teacher wanting close that gap a bit to catch-up go to learn how to do so?
455,"Nice job explaining the theory-practice gap to the general audience of Reddit.

That said, do you want to have to explain that everytime you reference it to another educator? Or is simply saying theory-practice gap easier?"
456,"I think your argument is perfectly sound. However, education is a rather special case when it comes to academic research. Jargon allows a number of complex concepts to be discussed in a single packet, which is rather crucial for efficiently communicating at the frontiers of a technical field. Papers have to be maximally precise; analogies and common English are typically insufficient. I do think the typical academic work could use a pass or two at de-jargoning, but it should only be applied where it can be gotten away with."
457,">we have a huge problem of teachers being years if not decades behind the latest and greatest in educational practice because the last time they got any sort of educational theory was in college

Not to be a cynic but, in my experience, even when practicing teachers know the theory, it often doesn't help very much, for a variety of reasons."
458,"At a guess is say that there's a term for predicted grades, or the poorer kids etc that lay people won't know?

My housemate for example is a teacher and drops the odd term. SEN for example, so a lot of lay people isn't necessarily known, but is perfectly understandable to those in the industry.

The theory practice gap absolutely applies, and is important to bridge, but there's also a theory-lay person gap which is even bigger.

Within research contexts I'd absolutely say being concise and using correct terminology to prevent confusion is more important than bridging that gap."
459,I find it interesting that you use jargon (theory-practice gap) and have to contextualize it before carrying on. It would be exhausting to do this constantly. For writer and reader.
460,Depends on the field. I refuse to believe that there's any significant amount of people outside the field reading catalytic electrochemistry papers.
461,"Personally I prefer short and extremely dense articles with easy to digest abstract and conclusion. Then you get it both ways. A 40 page paper takes too long to read when you have a 100 papers to read. And when I write a paper I prefer short and concise. I absolutely only write to my peers. But the abstract, posters, perhaps figures, and 50% of the discussion/introduction I try to make more general. Even then papers tend to be over 20 pages long. But yes, it's important to communicate out from the ivory tower but time and money. Too little of either."
462,"Within-field academic writing should be short and to the point even if it includes jargon. Scientists have to read and digest an insane amount of material to keep up in their field, and when you know the material it's much easier and quicker to read the jargon.

For example, I unfortunately read many papers adjacent to my field (math) which are written by people slightly outside my field (CS). Mathematical writing becomes long, clunky, and cumbersome when it includes all computational steps without omitting obvious ones, and when it and avoids using words like ""functor"" and ""colimit"" except as an aside. Most of the 40 page papers I've read shortened into digestible 3-5 pages of mathematics that would have taken me significantly less time to read and communicated the point more clearly to people in the field."
463,Why would you not want the average person to understand the article?
464,"I agree, but there are definitely niche scientific fields that rely on jargon for concision. There‚Äôs also the argument that the vocabulary used in niche fields is ubiquitous in their individual communities, so any reader will likely already be familiar with the jargon. This isn‚Äôt always the case, though."
465,I think he means that if every research paper had to explain everything in plain English it would get a crazy amount bigger. Like behind a lot of the jargon are some very complex ideas and theories that could take a paper themselves to explain in plain English.
466,"I just joined the field of catalytic electrochemistry, and have to look up stuff very often. I look through some of the articles and don't see how the articles could be written without jargon, without seeming almost ironically dumbed down. And I don't see why they would remove the jargon, because the only time someone without at least a bachelors degree in the field would read the papers, is when the university PR department want to overhype a new release."
467,"In many scientific fields, the concepts being talked about, the prior research being treated as a given and known to the audience, is so vast and so complex that it is just not feasible to make it readable to a lay audience. You don't just go and make a physics paper ""easily digestable"". It's full of math! You don't just ""put in extra work"" to make a genetics paper easily digested. It's just not feasible and not necessary.

These papers are so specific, if you broke them down in simple language, they would stop being useful to scientists who speak the language of science. At least in the hard sciences, being understandable to laymen is not a desireable goal."
468,"Yes, that is where scientific journalism comes in, to translate the study for the lay person. 

If every single academic paper had to be readable to the common person, they would basically be statistics text books"
469,Coherent to a lay person is not the same as coherent to someone in the field.
470,"In order to be precise and accurate, you almost always need to use jargon, which is what you're arguing against. Dumbing down research papers isn't going to do anyone any good."

When you replace one or two _sentences_ with a couple words, it makes catching someone else up _a lot_ faster, notes shorter, diagnosis far more difficult to misconstrue when it's an exact term instead of a loose description, etc, etc. It also helps a lot when working in other countries. Instead of a doctor going, ""crap, I don't know the French word for infection, how do I say this...""

Unified terms also make international R&D infinitely easier for similar reasons.

Latin/Greek in the medical field does make sense. Though journalists are still fully capable of overusing the terms, of course.

To use gravity again as an example, Issac Newton made a law of gravity. He made an equation to explain it. But a theory of gravity would be developed much later as the result of research by Einstein and other scientists that tried to explain why gravity exists and how it works."

A theory tells us why something happens. Curvature of space-time, hot molecules bounce harder off the walls.  Theories take all of the relevant observations and weave them into a story that explains why the things we saw happened. 

If I see something happen once (a better joke in the comments), it isn't a law of nature. If I see the same thing every time across multiple scenarios (the real joke is always in the comments) it starts to gain acceptance as a law. I can now use that law to support (or invalidate) other ideas, because it is accepted that it will always happen. 

I have a hypothesis (an unsupported explaination) that better comedians don't submit, but only comment. There is a competing hypothesis that commenters have the ability to improve on the OP because they have a chance to respond to feedback in the comments.

I can make observations to test my hypothesis, (looking to see if ""real joke"" commenters ever submit jokes) if I find examples where my hypothesis doesn't work, I refine it, or outright reject it.  Eventually, with enough evidence the community will accept one of the explanations.

They contact the user and ask ""hey, I noticed an application using SMTP is being blocked by our firewall from your computer. Any idea what might cause that?"" Of course, user has no idea what that is. The analyst doesn't know that SMTP is simply email. They could have asked the user (had they known) ""hey, is your email acting funny?

Someone who has literally spent their entire lives studying, trying to understand and possibly even teaching others about a given theory or model are not going to be eager to disprove it and will not uncommonly go to rather comical lengths to deny any attempt to do so. The Great Debate in astronomy and astrophysics is a fantastic example of this. 

That said there are also matters of maintaining access to research resources to keep in mind as well. Whether or not someone is directly told to come to a certain conclusion there may be pressure to do so out of fear that they will lose access to critical resources for further research. Most research scientists operate on very minimal budgets and every penny counts, losing access to what little funding they have can be disastrous."

That's just within one undergraduate degree. Now consider that scientists have worked within their field through at least their master's and are primarily concerned with figuring out what is true and disseminating that information efficiently to others who will make use of that information, as well as absorbing new information efficiently.

Did you mean 'almost comically'? :)

In any case, I agree, the point of 'jargon' is that you can carry a whole paragraph of meaning (or even way more) in a single word. This is bad for people not in the field, but that's not who research papers are aimed at - it is however very good for efficient communication between people in the field.

Sometimes, there is a tendency to make sentences sound more complicated than they need to be, I have noticed that before - it makes your argument sound more learned e.g. in a paper. In my opinion, that's a bad thing - but most of the 'jargon' discussed by OP's article is not unnecessary complication, it's just technical terms without which science can't really function."
515,"> At least in the hard sciences, being understandable to laymen is not a desireable goal.

Neither is it in the not-so-hard sciences. *Every* science relies on using a set of defined terms that each would take quite a while to explain to a layperson, if they could even understand it by itself without first having to learn a whole host of other terms.

Science just can't be simplified and still be useful for scientists in the same field. It can be simplified so it's more understandable to laypeople, which is of course perfectly fine, or rather, definitely necessary, but that's not how state-of-the-art or cutting-edge research is conducted."

531,"Good scientific articles (those that could equally be explained verbally) focuses more on what we know about a process through causation than on simply describing the different components (of which there'll be many to memorize) and observations. I refer to papers describing causation in a process as knowledge papers and the other as observational papers that basically describe the data.

Knowledge papers provide insight into the process rather than just describing different categories of events/data typified in observational papers. An observational paper will typically have a lot of technical jargon. It makes sense that such papers are hard to read, since the gist of the paper is clouded by terms instead of a description of the causative process.

The vast majority of scientific papers are observational papers, mostly because it's much easier to write and publish given publish or perish academic environment. Knowledge papers are extremely difficult to write since everything you write must be falsifiable and evidenced. The same does not hold for observational papers (just needs some evidence interpreted using some peer-accepted approach)."
532,"But again, the amount of extra information that is needed to explain it requires a whole paragraph.

""Topological insulating chalcogenides and the effect of strain"" would literally require you to tell people:

What topological insulators are, what the family of compounds are that are chalcogenides, what strain is defined by in this paper, and then what the applications are (which typically are complicated in their own right).

Name almost any solid state exotic phenomenon, without including even compounds yet, and try to explain it and it's applications to a layman. Superconductivity is arguably the easiest, yet even it is extremely complex, and summerizing the phenomena doesn't do it justice as many applications are due to the consequences of ~ 0 resistance rather than the 0 resistance itself. For example you can't explain superconductivities applications in NMRI's without also explaining how moving charges create a magnetic field, which begins to open up more cans of worms."
533,Not true in math and physics. You'd need to do a lot of explaining to get around the technical terms. It's not gatekeeping and more just a communication short cut.
534,"In the context of science, I have no idea what I would be doing without jargon. 

Remember that post a little bit ago about the woman on the plane who reported a guy for ""writing in a foreign script"", when it turned out he was doing math? 

That's kind of what it feels like. A lot of specific terms/symbols are immediately understandable to experts because they spent weeks learning about them in school/being exposed to it during training.

Not to say there's absolutely zero gatekeeping, but in the sciences a lot of the jargon conveys highly abstract concepts that do legitimately take weeks to explain in plain English"
535,"Would you provide some examples? I'm interested.

All jargon I've encountered so far has been out of necessity/tradition. You could (even when communicating with non-layman) use common words to convey the same meaning, but that takes time and time is often a luxury. Obviously, when I explain something technical to a non-layman I always try to keep it simple and make sure they understand before proceeding. Sometimes that means going on tangents, because they lack the background knowledge.

(The recent Coronavirus has been worrying many of my friends, so I'm referencing recent conversations.)"
536,"I got my BA in physics and business and I felt that the jargon used in text for science was necessary however there‚Äôs a huge need for translations into more layman‚Äôs terms. But people who speak using all of the correct jargon are usually gatekeeping.  
On the other hand a lot of the jargon used in my business courses felt a lot like gatekeeping.  Especially when people start having conversations to others who are not studying business."
537,"Yea, definitely not true for programming.

I've had conversations with co-workers during which I've passively realized that almost every active word is some jargon that would mean nothing (or the wrong thing) to someone outside the field.  But most of those things have specific meanings that are otherwise difficult to describe."
538,"From my own experience, legal jargon is definitely a mixed bag. Sometimes lawyers use specific words and phrases because they need precision and reliability; but other times it's because lawyers get a kick out of being impossible to understand. 

The garbled sentence ""Said plaintiff did then bring suit against said defendant for said amounts, aforesaid, under the terms of the written instrument, and for any other relief as the court may, in its determination, find said plaintiff to be entitledto."" could just as easily be ""Plaintiff sued Defendant for the amount owed under the contract and for any other relief to which he may be entitled."" It loses almost no meaning in the law or in layperson's terms. 

The sentence on Louisiana property law ""Donations inter vivos of incorporeals and immovables are absolutely null unless made by authentic act."" can be explained ""Gifts of things you can't touch (like bank accounts or ownership shares of a business) or big things like land or buildings must be made  in writing and must be notarized.""

Scientist aren't using jargon just because they want to alienate people or make things needlessly complicated. It's because it takes A LOT of extra effort to get away with NOT using it while still effectively communicating what you're trying to say.

All humans learning jargon must at least partially implement their own framework. Even if they read explanations, there is some internal translation going on to get the idea cogent in their minds.  This is probably why it kills people's interest: it's hard to do."

But you can't get around that, otherwise the reader will not even have a basic imagination of the subject. You will need to explain at least bits of high school chemistry for that.

Then you will have to explain what makes them so interesting. The only thing that will be directly interesting for the reader are applications. However, that's where the disconnect really is. Most research is focused on studying interesting phenomena, discovering new physics, finding a deeper understanding of nature, and possible applications might just not be forseeable yet and if so, it might be a rather vague idea. The scientific progress itself will be ""hard locked"" behind a basic understanding of solid state physics. You can deliver that to someone that has an undergrad in physics without much hazzle, but in any other case you'll finding yourself explaining at least basics from quantum mechanics and electrodynamics as well.

And that article shouldn't generally bother itself trying to explain what topological insulating chalcogenides are. Probably not even mention those kinds of terms at all if the audience is general enough.

Important ideas need to be distilled into three general formats. A technical paper fit for a journal with peers in mind; a less technical article for those with a strong interest and/or background in science/technology, but maybe not in the specific subject; a very simplistic article for a general audience.

594,"""Dingoes are wild canids living in Australia, originating from domestic dogs. They have lived isolated from both the wild and the domestic ancestor, making them a unique model for studying feralization. Here, we sequence the genomes of 10 dingoes and 2 New Guinea Singing Dogs. Phylogenetic and demographic analyses show that dingoes originate from dogs in southern East Asia, which migrated via Island Southeast Asia to reach Australia around 8300 years ago, and subsequently diverged into a genetically distinct population. Selection analysis identifies 50 positively selected genes enriched in digestion and metabolism, indicating a diet change during feralization of dingoes. Thirteen of these genes have shifted allele frequencies compared to dogs but not compared to wolves. Functional assays show that an A-to-G mutation in ARHGEF7 decreases the endogenous expression, suggesting behavioral adaptations related to the transitions in environment. Our results indicate that the feralization of the dingo induced positive selection on genomic regions correlated to neurodevelopment, metabolism and reproduction, in adaptation to a wild environment."""

Domestication syndrome is long-lasting and even in the dingo we see differences between it and other wild canids.  

If there is introgression between wild and domestic conspecifics (e.g. feral pig and wild boar), I think the inclination is to consider it less of a feral ""domestic"" population and more part a population of the wild species."

(Does that sound at all like your pet dog?) Further, their fear response to new people or objects was reduced, and they were more eager to explore new situations. Many of the domesticated foxes had floppy ears, short or curly tails, extended reproductive seasons, changes in fur coloration, and changes in the shape of their skulls, jaws, and teeth. They also lost their ""musky fox smell.""


The experiment ran about 60 years and the foxes' descendants are now classified as domesticated. A much shorter experiment ran from 1996-1999 and at the end of it some of the foxes were sold as pets. Similar time frames have been seen with breeding wild cats as well to where it is about F5 or 5 generations from feral to be considered safe as a pet.

Technically never as wild means never domesticated. However, the Mustangs of the Americas are considered wild by many and they became feral after escaping the Conquistadors in the 1500s."

There were some, in Mongolia I believe, that were long considered wild but genetic testing showed that they had been domesticated and bred to their distinctive pattern and then released or escaped thousands of years ago and thus they too are now considered feral.

A team of scientists at the Keck School of Medicine of USC have found people who vape exhibit similar chemical modifications in their overall genome and in parts of their DNA as people who smoke cigarettes.

These specific chemical alterations, also known as epigenetic changes, can cause genes to malfunction -- and are commonly found in nearly all types of human cancer as well as other serious diseases.

The findings add to a growing list of health concerns associated with vaping, which is perceived by many as a safer alternative to smoking. E-cigarette use has soared among youth, with more than 25 percent of high school students now using the products, according to the CDC.

The new study, led by Ahmad Besaratinia, PhD, associate professor at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, examined a group of people matched for age, gender and race, divided equally into three categories: vapers only, smokers only and a control group of people who neither vaped nor smoked.

Blood was drawn from each of the participants and tested for changes in levels of two specific chemical tags attached to DNA that are known to impact gene activity and/or function. These chemical tags include: (1) methyl groups in a specific DNA sequence, named Long Interspersed Nucleotide Element 1 (LINE-1); and (2) hydroxymethyl groups in the genome overall. Changes in the levels of these chemical tags, which are important for genomic stability and regulation of gene expression, occur in various stages of development, as well as in diseases such as cancer.

632,"\^\^\^\^

&#x200B;

i rarely trust these vape studies these days.  Though obviously Nicotine is Nicotine no matter the form you intake it. Vaping is a thousand chemicals fewer than cigarettes no matter how you look at it (literally burning plant material...), and doesnt have the crazy amount of Tar associated with smoking of any kind.  I quit a 20 year cigarette habit that was costing me hundreds of dollars every month,  by switching to basic Tank vape and juices, now costing me $20 a month.  So my lungs dont get tar, i dont inhale thousands of other chemicals, and it cost me a tenth of the price....

&#x200B;

but the people trying to take down vaping dont care about anything but the big tobacco kickbacks, so good luck people"
633,They were all screened and the likeliness is low.
634,There was just something in r/Science the other day that said there is an effect. I can‚Äôt remember the city
635,"Doesn't sound like it has anything to do with the device/temp/liquid/brand. The only chemical they would share is nicotine.

The title should say nicotine leaves biomarkers regardless of method of intake."
636,"Similarly, it doesn't express any quantitative data either. For all we know, the study could actually reinforce the message that vaping is safer (not safe) after all."
637,"If found, could you share ?"
638,"So since the only real overlapping ingredient vapes and cigarettes share is nicotine, this just puts the previously inconclusive ""is nicotine a carcinogen"" question back under the spotlight?"
639,"Also you probably smell a lot better. 

Because smoking impairs your sense of smell. 

Also it stinks. A lot."
640,[deleted]
641,Great question. I think they specifically mention when it's thc/cbd mods because the transmission is often very different between the two
642,They have nothing to gain from this considering they have invested a lot into vaping to try and offset declining cigarette profits.
643,They're all nicotine products
644,But what you don‚Äôt know is how painful a heart attack is. Then you‚Äôll wish you hadn‚Äôt done it.
645,"Nobody thinks vaping is safe, it's just very likely that when properly utilized that it's substantially less harmful than smoking, which would still be very difficult statement to make untrue without vaping arsenic and uranium."
646,"This isnt a legit study. There is no information detailing the process. The things it claims arent founded on any real data being shown. The control groups and parameters are unknown. You're just an idiot because ""legit study"" equates to ""study I agree with"" for you."
647,The problem is that we can't know from this study because we don't know if the participants are ex smokers or not.
648,Yea I wouldn't be surprised if the tiny things from tobacco companies actually used the whole alkaloid or whatever which would include MAOIs.
649,"Congrats!  I‚Äôm just over a year without a regular cigarette habit (had 2 drunk smokes in 2019, both disgusted me) and I‚Äôm down to 15mg juice. I smoked for 24 years and I‚Äôve not felt this good in a long time.  I don‚Äôt think I would have ever quit cigarettes with vaping as an option, and now I can see a future without nicotine entirely. While I‚Äôm still addicted, I find that nic salt addiction is much different than cigarette nicotine addiction. Like I used to get squirrely on long flights or when I wasn‚Äôt able to smoke once an hour. Now I can go a full day without and barely notice"
650,It does not sound like it. Most vapers are ex smokers. So the Biomakers of someone that smoked never go away. That and could there be a decrease in biomakers??
651,Or maybe  the people that vape had a past of smoking? That the only real link. Or where all of the people test where never smokers but vapers?
652,"It wasn‚Äôt really ever out of the spotlight. However considering there‚Äôs no mention of a control for people who used to solely smoke but switched to solely vaping and n=45 I‚Äôd consider this a trash paper. More, and better designed, studies are needed."
653,What's your point?
654,Just because they have a stake in vaping doesn't mean they aren't losing money over declining cigarette sales
655,Yes but form and absorption and such matter.
656,That wil only last a little bit though and with some luck you won't feel a thing anymore haha
657,"Considering the results,why not do another ?"
658,Take that juice lower! You'll do fine at 12 and then bump it to six. I'm at a 3 consistently!
659,margins are higher on vape products since they don't contain tobacco.
660,"I'd agree but according to the study they already crossed cigarettes and vapes, eliminating thousands of chemicals and leaving only nicotine."
661,"That‚Äôs exactly what I thought! However, the pain is quite severe. It feels like you are getting stabbed. In certain cases it goes away if you sit down then comes back if you walk a block. Your first inclination is to make it stop (this I must emphasize), not wait a while and hope it gets so bad that you die. So you go to a doctor and end up with some sort of cure. Now you‚Äôre right back where you started except with some sort of large deductible you have to pay off. It‚Äôs fifteen years later and now you have a family. 

Anyway it‚Äôs the most expensive painful way to go. And you never know when or if it‚Äôs going to happen. I don‚Äôt recommend it."
662,Hopefully they do that and actually control more variables so that the results of the study can be meaningful.
663,"I just dropped from 25/30mgs to 15 and I didn‚Äôt really notice. Like maybe a few instances were I was pulling a bit harder or more often to get a stress fix, so I think the next bottle I buy will be lower again just to see where I stand. 

Thanks for the encouragement!"

674,"I don't much like him either but this is kinda off topic. They have rules here for off topic comments too btw, just so you know"
675,"Spiders certainly respond to stimuli, and they react to the macro world in defensive ways, these are perhaps levels of awareness we could define or develop, perhaps a spider is too basic to have fear as we know it but they do have the instinct to retreat or flee, fight or flight, while emotional intelligence in a social species triggers fear and adrenaline, it heightens our awareness and supercharges our muscles so we can snap into action.

From the simplest forms of life operating as little more than a chemical reaction, all the way to a human who is aware of advance scientific and philosophical concepts, we can name these stages of life and test to categorize where each belong."

680,I bet 10 bucks that it is a Neutron Star like every time there is a repeating signal with a pattern.
681,Aren't regular patterns like this usually pulsars .or something similar?

687,Ancient astronaut theorists believe that the signal could be from an alien dance party in a distant galaxy.

And cats are aloof, seemingly selfish and can switch from enjoying their owners company to needing to escape it or simply tolerating it. Stereotypical of men."

Not sure if they're serious or not but some people willing to die for their pet if necessary, or threatened to kill/harm other people when their pet just got hurt a little bit. it's too fanatic in my opinion, treating your pet like it is your children is not good, after all they are just animal."

First, the original study that collected the occasional users had a battery of cognitive functioning tests and this study did not mention that and did not mention the a similar battery of tests (but did say similar methods were used). If they collected all this information, why wasn't it mentioned? If they didn't, why not? I would think exploring functional differences alongside the brain scan comparisons would be of interest. Makes me think that there werent many functional differences between groups. Further, it introduces the potential that the researchers may have been selective with which data they included. 

Second, limitations weren't really discussed towards the (what I interpret as) the low power non-parametric t-test combined with the small group sizes and cross sectional between subjects design.

I'm not saying their conclusions are wrong, just that the paper presents a very incomplete picture and moderately sensationalized results."

830,"Study (open access): [Early Last Interglacial ocean warming drove substantial ice mass loss from Antarctica](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/10/1902469117)
____

>**Significance**

>Fifty years ago, it was speculated that the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet is vulnerable to warming and may have melted in the past. Testing this hypothesis has proved challenging due to the difficulty of developing in situ records of ice sheet and environmental change spanning warm periods. We present a multiproxy record that implies loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet during the Last Interglacial (129,000 to 116,000 y ago), associated with ocean warming and the release of greenhouse gas methane from marine sediments. Our ice sheet modeling predicts that Antarctica may have contributed several meters to global sea level at this time, suggesting that this ice sheet lies close to a ‚Äútipping point‚Äù under projected warming.

>**Abstract**

>The future response of the Antarctic ice sheet to rising temperatures remains highly uncertain. A useful period for assessing the sensitivity of Antarctica to warming is the Last Interglacial (LIG) (129 to 116 ky), which experienced warmer polar temperatures and higher global mean sea level (GMSL) (+6 to 9 m) relative to present day. LIG sea level cannot be fully explained by Greenland Ice Sheet melt (‚àº2 m), ocean thermal expansion, and melting mountain glaciers (‚àº1 m), suggesting substantial Antarctic mass loss was initiated by warming of Southern Ocean waters, resulting from a weakening Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in response to North Atlantic surface freshening. Here, we report a blue-ice record of ice sheet and environmental change from the Weddell Sea Embayment at the periphery of the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), which is underlain by major methane hydrate reserves. Constrained by a widespread volcanic horizon and supported by ancient microbial DNA analyses, we provide evidence for substantial mass loss across the Weddell Sea Embayment during the LIG, most likely driven by ocean warming and associated with destabilization of subglacial hydrates. Ice sheet modeling supports this interpretation and suggests that millennial-scale warming of the Southern Ocean could have triggered a multimeter rise in global sea levels. Our data indicate that Antarctica is highly vulnerable to projected increases in ocean temperatures and may drive ice‚Äìclimate feedbacks that further amplify warming."
831,Multi-Metre is 6-9m  Which is 20-30 feet.
832,Well I guess Trump won‚Äôt be able to deny global warming much longer then because his precious Mar-a-Lago is only 15 feet above the current sea level. üòÇü§£
833,Isn't there some volcanic activity under the ice sheet going on atm?
834,"What I don't understand is this:

If 'something' caused the ice caps to FORM (i.e., 'cooling'), why do people get so worried that 'something' is causing them to melt? Do people not realize there are daily, yearly, period etc cycles? Why do people worry about this? Its simply not realistic to worry about it. If it's 'man-made', you have to get rid of the man or the made, and western civilization is making huge strides to combat both. I've been to Egypt, China and India in my lifetime and only til Greta makes headwinds into those countries will I be hopeful of any change. Until then, its simply talk."
835,Omg.... Humans were ruining the planet even then?
836,Science...this the same place that just concluded that witnesses on weed are unreliable?  Glad science hasn‚Äôt sold out...
837,"Lies, ice ages dont end and ice doesn't melt as the earth exits them, we melt all the ice and end ice ages... the fact that we are coming out of a mini ice age has nothing to do with the ice melting..."

843,notice it took tens of thousands of years. not 200
844,"My car got really hot last summer when I left it outside. Surely this proves that my car's temperature is a natural cycle and man-made AC can't be responsible for the warming this morning!

Have you ever heard of the greenhouse effect? It's pretty basic physics. We have observed that it's causing less energy to radiate out than what is radiated in, and that difference is explained by the CO2+H2O that we added to the atmosphere. Energy in minus energy out equals increase in thermal energy. This is obvious enough that natural cycles are about as likely as a cause for the temperature rise, as they were in my car after I turned on the AC this morning."
845,"Why don't you actually go to the effort to look at the events and timeframes involved here and get an understanding of what's happening. I guarantee if you genuinely do that, it won't be funny any more."
846,Pretty sure science has concluded that *all* witnesses are unreliable... Shouldn't be surprising that taking a slightly mind-altering drug like alcohol or weed makes them slightly less reliable.
847,"Corruption, racism, and lack of science stigmatized weed in the first place. 

Science has proven witnesses in general to be unreliable.

Science is now dispersing the stigma weed carries."

859,"Not really news--we've used the negative connotations of the word ""tribalism"" to refer to this phenomenon for a long time. The smaller your tribe (i.e., the lower your relational mobility), the more intensely you reject threats to its members."
860,"Morality is subjective, and potentially combative, people become hostile towards each other on moral grounds more often than morality defuses conflict. Morality is the reason why humans need laws, laws liberate a citizen to style their own personal code of conduct within established legal bounds, meaning your rights as a citizen overrule the moral insistence of other citizens."
861,"The legal system exists to enforce the moral code of the society that institutes it. Not the other way around. Laws are just words on paper that reflect agreements society has with itself. Morality is the same social contract, without the written form or lack of adaptability to changing times."

863,Gotta confuse the brain babe.
864,And people waste money in drugs when they could breath.
865,Did they just call expanding your mind brain entropy?  K guys.   Science sucks at naming things.   Just saying.  Love y'all.
866,"Maybe you just suck at comprehending science my dude... If that's the conclusion/interpretation you derive from the study at least?

Get the feeling you are attaching a somewhat negative connotation to the concept of ""brain entropy"" as if slightly offended that your ""mind expansion"" be labelled as such. Did you read the actual study or at least the article extrapolating from it? I'd say it's a perfectly applied term for what you and I both are envisioning the concept of ""expanding your mind"" as.. at least imo :)

Brain entropy is a far more specific and universally understood term than ""expanding your mind"" which is ambiguous and subjective nonsense. No hate intended, just get overly triggered and defensive when people put their subjective opinion over an established body of scientific consensus."
867,"Sure, thanks.     If we can agree that 'entropy' has generally a *negative* connotation to anyone who doesn't study thermodynamics, while 'expanding your mind' is a more positive thought.   Since we are speaking of the mind, saying that meditation causes entropy might excite fellow vocabularians, but instantly it hit the 'negatron' vibe within myself, to be scientific about it.

Taking a look at the top two defintions 

PHYSICS
a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system.
2.
lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder.


Neither of these are exciting things to do to my mind.  Adding randomness, gradual decline or disorder is not usually something a human seeks for their mind.   You can shake your measuring stick at the various definitions attributed to 'entropy', but I still contend that it is a poor choice.

(I liked the article)"
868,"It is called brain entropy because there is an increase in irregular variability of brain activity, making the way the brain communicates with itself more chaotic. Scientists aren't trying to market this to consumers when they choose the term entropy, they're trying to accurately describe what they observe. 

There's really not a good way to define ""expanding the mind"" in a meaningful manner as far as we can measure, but since we can look at the physical connectivity and functional networking of the brain it has meaning to say the brain becomes more entropic in certain conditions, e.g. meditation and psychedelics"
869,Turning my brain into a ball of chaos that can't be predicted from the outside actually sounds pretty fuckin cool to me.
870,That's called a seizure. It's not that cool.

873,"I believe they've done something like this with atmospheric noise as well. It's all still pseudorandom though. We don't have an escape hatch from determinism.

Atmospheric conditions and the crystallization process are just very complex, enough to where they can produce an adequate ""random"" number generator."
874,"Have these ""random"" strings been tested for randomness, and which tests ?  Test results ?"
875,Simpsons did it first.
876,"There's a quantum random number generator with a free api
And if you had a geiger counter you could make your own"
877,"It is not pseudorandom. In a chaotic system like crystallization where any difference in initial conditions will lead to a completely different outcome we speak of a system that is both deterministic and unpredictable, because in practice you could never know the initial conditions with perfect accuracy (which is required to make a prediction in a chaotic system)"
878,Doesn't quantum fluctuations change the size of the crystals enough?
879,So the results in the paper that‚Äôs linked?
880,"
>because in practice you could never know the initial conditions with perfect accuracy (which is required to make a prediction in a chaotic system)

Whether or not we could ever know enough to predict it doesn't influence whether it's truly random or not."
881,"It compared the results with a pseudorandom number generator, but not statistical tests that test for randomness, that are used to test other random number generators."
882,"It does.

A pseudorandom process by definition is a process that produces a predictable outcome given the required information where in absence of said information a sequence of numbers generated by said process exhibits statistical randomness.

A true random number by definition is a number selected from a range with equal chance of all numbers being selected via an unpredictable method.

Unlike any manmade algorithm that produces pseudorandom numbers, a chaotic complex system like this has completely unpredictable behaviour. No amount of information would ever allow you to predict the outcome."
883,"‚ÄúThe output binary sequences were evaluated for randomness using the tests for randomness recommended by NIST and published in NIST special publication 800-22a.‚Äù

Results summarized in Figure 4."
884,">In a chaotic system like crystallization where any **difference in initial conditions** will **lead to** a completely **different outcome** we speak of a system that is both **deterministic** and unpredictable, because **in practice** you could never know the initial conditions with perfect accuracy 

If something is deterministic, as you yourself said that this is, then that means it isn't truly random. If something can be predicted given perfect information on the relevant variables, it isn't truly random. It might not be feasible in practice, but neither is *truly* predicting *anything* given that we cannot possibly account for every single variable in practice. We also can't measure anything with perfect accuracy, we can only approximate reality to a precision of X decimals. 

That means we can only ever make approximate predictions, but that doesn't mean that the exact flight path of a thrown ball is truly random, since it is still deterministic."
885,Never thought of randomness that way. Kinda interesting if we cant possibly know enough about the environment then we cant possible determine the outcome.

888,"A growing health crisis fueled by synthetic chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in groundwater has garnered much attention in the last few years.

The reported levels could be ""just the tip of the iceberg,"" as most of the chemicals are still migrating down slowly through the soil, according to Bo Guo, University of Arizona assistant professor of hydrology and atmospheric sciences.

Nearly 3,000 synthetic chemicals belong to the PFAS class. They have been used since the 1940s in food packaging, water-resistant fabrics, non-stick products, pizza boxes, paints, firefighting foams and more, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The chemicals don't break down in the environment or in the body, and a growing number of research papers have shown that PFAS contamination in water sources is widespread in the United States and that exposure is harmful to health.

""Because PFAS are in a lot of consumer and industrial products, they can get into wastewater. Treatment plants are not designed to treat these compounds, so these chemicals just stay in that water to get reused. It's sprayed on soccer fields or used to recharge aquifers, for example,"" said Mark Brusseau, professor of environmental science. ""PFAS can also get into the biosolids, which are land-applied as fertilizer, so there are all these sources, which means they could have entered the environment at many different time periods and repeatedly.""

To understand how the chemicals migrate through the soil between the land surface and groundwater ‚Äì an area called the vadose zone ‚Äì University of Arizona researchers developed a novel mathematical model to simulate the different complex processes that affect the transport and retention of these chemicals.

Privatize the profits, socialize the costs.  

The same thing happened with [leaded gasoline](https://www.wired.com/2013/01/looney-gas-and-lead-poisoning-a-short-sad-history/). 

The states of New York and Pennsylvania banned leaded gasoline in 1924, but they were overridden by a federal government ruling that acknowledged that future problems may occur from using lead in gasoline. 

So when leaded gasoline was finally banned for good many decades later, a decrease in violent crime happened at the same time.   

Turns out that lead causes brain damage that can increase the risk of violent crime in people that already have other risk factors.  

But hey, why let a problem like forcing the country to breathe lead get in the way of corporate profits?"

2. Lifestyle"
912,"‚ÄúBody height, a biomarker that reflects the interplay of genetic endowment and early-life experiences and exposures (e.g., nutrition, social and psychological circumstances), may provide insights into the aetiology of a wide range of disease outcomes. In the current study, the authors explore the association between body height and dementia. They use Danish national registers to obtain data from the conscript board, including height, intelligence, and educational attainment, matched with data from health registers to identify those with dementia diagnoses or who were taking medication typically prescribed for Alzheimer's disease. Their results showed that taller body height was associated with significantly lower rate of dementia after adjusting for a series of confounders. In addition, they attempted to distinguish this protective effect of body height from confounding by genetics ‚Äì a strong determinant of height ‚Äì through analysis of within siblings and within twin differences. This study represents a potentially valuable contribution to the literature on early life risk factors for dementia.‚Äù

918,"An excerpt 

> So, what does this tell us about chronotypes? The report does extend previous results by showing that, on average, students benefit when there's a better match between chronotype and school start time‚Äîit's not just a matter of early birds doing better when school starts early. But, at the same time, the results indicate that there's never a time of day when the students with the latest chronotype outperform the early birds.

>But there are at least two ways to look at that finding. One is that the early birds have a general academic advantage and get an extra boost when the school schedule matches their chronotype. While the latter advantage goes away as the chronotype mismatch gets larger, the former stays with them, allowing them to maintain parity at later school start times. Another way focuses on the finding that everyone always has a bit of social jet lag and suggests that morning people simply deal with it a bit better, which offsets the benefits that later chronotypes might see from later school start times.

In other words, the early bird does indeed catch the worm."

925,"I taught at a late start high school. Since the kids got out later, they worked later (at jobs) - like until midnight or 1am during the week. I was shocked but I guess paying bills was the most important. They were just as tired, and we lost tons of hours of instruction for athletes who missed half the day for games multiple times a week. 

Four day school week with a day for extracurriculars might be more practical, but unfortunately, school is partly free child care. And too many kids *have* to work because their parents don't make enough money. The problems that need to be addressed are so much deeper than school start time"
926,"Ive just read Matthew Walker's why we sleep and there is a whole section in it about this very subject. Sleep cycles change throughout your life. Young people sleep later and wake later, it's got nothing to do with being lazy, it's just how the brain has evolved."

937,"A major issue with this is something most people don't want to hear:

After school sports are a thing, and many consider a very important thing. I'd imagine the Reddit crowd leans fairly heavily towards prioritizing academics over athletics, as would I. That being said, if you start school later, you get out of school later. Throughout much of the year, that means it gets dark quicker after school. Which leads to shorter practices. 

The other obvious issue is getting kids to school. Some have raised the idea that getting home FROM school is the same concept, as the kids get off school earlier than the parents get off work. This is an issue with motivation, however. Lots of kids need motivating to get to school on time. Hardly any need motivating to find their way back home. I was an excellent student, and still struggled at times to find motivation to get to school"

941,I don't see why we think it would be different for students that the rest of the world.  I hate working early and just being up early in general.  I hate that people who show up at 6am and leave by 2 or 3pm are considered go getters while those who roll in at 10am but stay until 6 or 7pm are considered lazy.

947,"It doesn't work if the students don't sleep, color me shocked."
948,Interesting...my school actually shifted start time by an hour and a half next year!
949,Completely has to do with the home life. Since there is virtually nothing a school can do to improve the home life later start times are better.
950,"My home room bell would ring at 7:15 am, during high school. I also lived pretty much right next door to high school. I was chronically late, like I‚Äôm pretty sure I got close to triple digit tardies. 

An interesting trend I noticed, with no effort exerted on my part, was that if I was late it was either just by a few minutes, or an entire period. But this was not due to me going ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm 20 minutes late, I may as well be an hour late.‚Äù I just seemed to either oversleep by like 10 minutes, or an hour and 10 minutes."
951,"Asking a teenager to be asleep by 10 is like asking an adult to be asleep by 6pm. A teenagers preference for staying up late is a BIOLOGICAL process which you cannot simply train them out of. Exactly why this happens is unknown, it's theorised it's something to do with teenagers being able to socialise with eachother alone if they simply stay up later than the adults - at a time when they are becoming more responsible and gaining independence. 

As we age (post 64) the opposite happens, with the elderly often going to bed and waking up very early. This is not a generational thing, unfortunately as we age our ability to sleep longer slowly deminishes, meaning the elderly can't help but wake up early, thus achieving little sleep. They then go to bed earlier and earlier as they are so tired, becoming more and more unknowingly sleep deprived."
952,"I would say in general, societies sleep patterns are no natural for humans."
953,American Schools: WOW! This is worthless!
954,But how does this help kids learn that no one really cares about their well-being? Especially those who will enslave... I mean hire them.
955,Students sleep late. Less sleep less concentration
956,I wonder if some sleep earlier and some don't.
957,Did they track the kids that ride the bus?
958,"Really doesn't matter to be honest, I doubt anyone was ever wondering whether, on average, students would perform better if they went later in the day. The problem is how prevalent a morning to evening schedule is for parents. Parents won't and can't often times, agree to schools changing to some weird schedule that makes everything difficult and awkward for all parties involved. Best you could hope for is a different schedule for Seniors in HS at most."
959,"This is, to me, the reason permanent DST is a really bad idea."
960,This is due to Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder which for some develops and becomes more pronounced in their teen years.
961,This is why I was better at college (afternoon classes) than I was high school. I‚Äôve never been good at mornings. I feel foggy and gross until I‚Äôve been up a few hours
962,">some people are not morning people

Groundbreaking scientific research"
963,While I would have preferred a later start time I'm curious what the long term changes would be. I wonder if teenagers lack of self control would just lead to them staying up till 2am every night rather than 11 or 12pm doing the same activities that cut into their sleep currently.
964,"Unless it's Reddit, TV, video games, etc."
965,"I wonder if that would be worthwhile to parents since I believe the major reason school days continue to be the length they are is because they provide ""free"" daycare."
966,"In Austria, they recently made 12 hour workdays legal. My brain is fried after 9 hours. There were protests, but the conservative party just ignored them. They were like ""But the poor business owners!""."

968,"I‚Äôm not surprised. I was one of those people who was constantly sleeping in class because it was just too early and the day was too long for me to pay attention. I also have ADD, and all those things combined just made school a nightmare for me. However, I was blessed with the ability to not pay a single bit of attention and still somehow absorb information. I made better grades than like 90 percent of my classmates in ‚Äúhonors‚Äù classes without even trying. The 8-3 schedule isn‚Äôt a good system for people like me that pick up information quickly and also have a hard time focusing for long periods of time."
969,Not an early bird. Fortunately I have the late shift at Chipotle.
970,That‚Äôs the thing though most workers aren‚Äôt actually working their whole day
971,"I sleep for 3 - 4 hours of my work day. So productive the rest of the time, though"
972,"But it isn't necessarily one thing though right? At school you'll favour some subjects over others which may be divided into 4-5 different subjects in primary and secondary school. I think my sleep schedule has actually gotten better in college consider I may have 1-2 classes max a day. Yes it is a given that evening classes aren't ideal for most students but hey if it means I can sleep in until noon, I'm sold. Honestly younger me would have been stoked for that change in schedule if he knew."
973,"The interesting thing is if you actually enjoy your job that doesn't apply as much. I'm with you for every other job I ever had, now that I found a job I love I can go all day most days.      

As far as school I had a very difficult time falling asleep early+getting up early. To the point I needed to be shaken awake rather harshly by my parents or I simply would not get up, not cuz I didn't want too, I would just fall right back to sleep. It was really hard on my parents jobs basically having to drag me out of bed."
974,The reason school is so long in the US is that we don‚Äôt have universal child care and wages are low enough that most families have to have both adults working full time.
975,Pretty sure people only want a shorter work week if its the same pay.
976,"> Humans aren‚Äôt meant to sit and concentrate on one thing for 8 hours.

Happens to me all the time"
978,"I'd rather the hour at the end. I'm a ""get things done first then relax"" type of person. All I'd do with an hour before is waste it cause I can't bring myself to start anything I'll have to stop right away."
979,"I think the study only measures student academic performance. This makes sense because you can measure outcomes and growth with tests.
But to answer your question with a question, how could you even begin to measure teacher performance?

To clarify: I am a high school educator and in my near decade of experience I have witnessed that good instruction has a major influence on performance. However, some students will perform well no matter what, and some students will perform poorly, unfortunately, no matter how much care and intervention you apply. Statistically speaking, I don‚Äôt know that any significant difference can be discerned when you change the start time of school and see a change in student performance. Is it because the students needed a later start time? Or because the instructors needed a later start time to be more effective? Too hard to measure the impact of teacher instruction alone when the start time influences both."

981,True. After a lifetime of being a night owl I found in my mid 30's I've started turning into more of an early riser.
982,Interesting but it makes sense the timing of the school has to match schedule of parents who have to go to work. They have to get the kids out first for them to go to work.
983,"Wait, the abstract says night school was better for some kids. They didn't even look at starting school a moderate amount of time later. They said everyone did worse in the afternoon, so why would we want to push more classes to that time slot?"
984,The worm has been designed to advantage the early bird
985,">But, at the same time, the results indicate that there's never a time of day when the students with the latest chronotype outperform the early birds.

Well of course -- the emphasis is on time of *day*.        Night owls won't get an advantage during the *day*.  

They're called ""night owls"" for a reason.  

When it's 9pm and the ""early birds"" are crashing and have to go to bed because their brains are falling asleep, the night owls are just getting started.   

If the schools are testing who is going to perform better from 11 am -- 4 pm, both groups would be performing the same."
986,"The issue is then, that you can‚Äôt just will yourself into it, your best hope is to find your chronotype.

992,It‚Äôs more true for teenagers. Their circadian rhythms are different than (most) adults.
993,"Absolutely. Doing shift work at BK, I ended up gravitating to closing shifts. Opens I was always tired, fumbly, and didn't work at my best. Shifts starting around 11am-12pm I was okay with, not so bad. But the close was where I was the most active/productive. After a few months of random shifts it was noticed, and I got nothing but closes - which I was actually happy about."
994,"When your parents start work at 6am, same deal."
995,"This is what everyone always brings up. I mean kids are out about 3:00 but parents aren't home until 5-6, what's the difference? Like how do you get home without them. You could use that same transportation method before school too in theory..."

1000,"Also, even if there are buses, they‚Äôre usually the same buses for elementary, middle and high school driving similar, if not the same, routes. That means the starts need to be offset to accommodate pickups for each level of students."
1001,"yeah that's what's lost in all these studies. Moving school to be an hour later means school busses are running at rush hour now. Traffic would become a nightmare. Or jobs would also just shift to later in the day to compensate, and now parents are getting home at 6pm having to cook dinner. School doesn't just start at 8:30 because it's tradition, it's because family life is built around that schedule. All that would happen is kids would still get dropped off at 8am and just wait there an extra hour for school to start because parents can't go to work later and can't leave their kids at home."
1002,Don't forget all extra curricular activities will end later too
1003,"with TV, computers, phones, games, etc, kids sleep much later.

1008,"I don't think the late start was what had them out until midnight or 1. I spent many a night watching tv or playing on the computer until 3 AM falling asleep and having to drag my ass to school at like 6 am. 

Generally speaking I'd say most states have laws for kids work schedule. I think it was until 10 PM on school nights in my area maybe 11PM."
1009,"In my district we start late (9am for high school) but it‚Äôs illegal in my state (Texas) for employers to allow employees under 18 to work past 10:30 pm on a school night.  Maybe passing/enforcing those protections for teen employees would be the place to start?

Honestly though I doubt that teens who needed the money wouldn‚Äôt work as late as they were allowed (by parents or employers) even with a 7:20 am school start time.  Teenagers have a sleep-wake cycle that is different from adults‚Äô or younger kids‚Äô so even when they don‚Äôt work late they will generally not fall asleep early enough to get enough sleep for an early start time."
1010,"Yes, but fixing one thing will force us to consider and fix the next thing.

Unfortunately we can't just scrap our school system and start over, especially with the worst leeches in the entire education system trying to convert the whole thing to ~~a massive money giveaway to the rich~~ Charter Schools so it is what it is."
1011,"This was my case back in school. Class started at 7, got out at 230, at work by 3 or 5 and worked till 10 to as late as 230, though usually on weeknights was out shortly rafter midnight. Worked 5 nights a week, with 4 usually being before a school day. School was for sleeping. I was a bit of a strange performer in school, low GPA (2.5), and high absences/tardiness, but among the highest test scores in the school and got excellent grades in my AP courses and a few others that were actually interesting or challenging. Most teachers didn't get it. Don't know how many lectures I got about work ethic."
1012,Idk where you are but in CA it's illegal for minors to work past 10 on a school night.
1013,Man. Capitalism is such a failure.
1014,I assume one factor would be between sleep and adolescent development? Correlating adequate sleep (notably during REM) with an increase in pubertal growth over time?

1019,"Recently switched shifts for a short job.

Always been a night owl and my job normally had us get there at 7 am. This job I'm on right now starts at 4 pm.

Last night, at 2 AM, when everyone else was exhausted, I was as energetic as most people are during the day.

I hate being a night owl though. Most people aren't up late at night and the ones that are... Well theres reasons most of them work at night.

Its physically exhausting to be up during the day but mentally exhausting to be up at night"
1020,This is why I work third shift.
1021,"I dropped out of HS because I couldn't get up early. Then I redid it and just skipped the first 2 classes every day. Despite not attending a third of my classes and having my grades docked by some teachers I tied for first in my class at the end. Most of that probably came from being in my twenties, but I'm sure some of it came from actually getting some sleep."
1022,That‚Äôs just horrible
1023,"This is beautifully explained in ""Why we sleep"" by M. Walker. Has to do with the fact that your sleep buildup and sleep rhythm are in fact 2 different things."
1024,"This is my sleep pattern almost exactly. I have tried ""fixing"" it many ways but nothing sticks. Interestingly, I wake up earliest naturally on the weekends by a large margin."
1025,"Remember my very first class of the day in 9th grade was something having to do with maps. Every morning when I'm still barely awake, the teacher would shut off the lights and project maps on a screen to discuss parts of the world in a very slow, monotone voice the entire period. I would literally be passed out in a lake of drool within 3 minutes of the lights going off and sleep till the teacher woke me up after the bell rung."
1026,"> Lots of kids need motivating to get to school on time. Hardly any need motivating to find their way back home

They don't need motivation to get to school, they need motivation to get up. Going home is easy because you're already up."
1027,"One of my kids is an athlete, and grades 7-12 switched to a later start time starting in his sophomore year. The teams just accommodated it. Probably the biggest hardship was having to leave school early for some games and meets - he would occasionally have to make up a test or assignment during lunch. But he loved loved loved the extra 45 min in the morning - he felt it made all the difference, and his grades shot up. He was quite jealous of his younger brother."
1028,"Sounds like schools should get out of the sports game. If sports, which serve a minority of students, dictate the rest of the school, something is broken. Time for weekend sports and city leagues. This is getting ridiculous. Every study shows that we are shortchanging students to cater to athletes."
1029,"There are alternatives, including before school athletics. And don‚Äôt say that defeats the purpose, because that would only affect the small number who would participate in them at that time. There could (and would) still be both after school and during the school day athletics."
1030,Has the article taken into account how much they sleep? I can imagine the students just sleeping less if they have early classes because they are students and stay up too late. Thus decreasing performance
1031,They are called EXTRAcurriculars for a reason. If they are so important they can come in before school. Why make the many suffer for the few?
1032,"I did theater after school, and when my school considered switching to a late start time we would have had rehearsals starting at 6:30am instead of 2:30pm. It would have been awful and would probably have severely impacted the amount of people willing to participate. My school didn‚Äôt have sports but it‚Äôs the same idea - you either have to be up incredibly early or out very late to practice. Late start times are logistically difficult."
1033,"One rebuttal I can have for this, is to schedule the athletics in the middle of the day (by breaking for a few hours and doing the sports things), or schedule it a bit earlier in the day, and have classes following."
1034,"Later start times (for middle and high school only) have worked fine in NEISD, a consistently high performing and well regarded (and ethnically/socioeconomically diverse) school district in San Antonio, Texas.  Being Texans they still take their school sports VERY seriously, they just do a significant portion of the practices in the morning (when it‚Äôs cooler anyway) and use more lights for evening practices.  

Morning practices don‚Äôt work for everyone of course ‚Äî some gifted athletes unfortunately don‚Äôt participate in the school sports and some gifted musicians don‚Äôt participate in the band because they can‚Äôt adjust to the early morning practice time.  But because the true point of school is, y‚Äôknow, the school part, it‚Äôs more important to start the mandatory school day at a time that benefits the most students.

Most students (again at the middle and high school level) are plenty motivated to get to school without their parents‚Äô supervision.  It‚Äôs a social experience and most adolescents do truly want to finish high school and want to avoid the consequences of truancy even if those consequences are at the end of the week rather than in the form of a parent nagging you out the door."
1035,Exact same case with me.
1036,"It's definitely the ""early bird gets the worm"" mentality. It's not going to go away either."
1037,"For me changing it from 7 to 8 am wouldn‚Äôt do much, but changing it from 7 to 10 am would."
1038,You do realize teenagers can‚Äôt fall asleep due to their circadian rhythm usually till 11 pm.  This has been established for a while.  In regards to test scores there are plenty of studies that show improvement from graduation rates to performance improvement in standardized testing.
1039,"Our school did this two years ago too! We saw a huge decrease is the number of 1st period tardies and just anecdotally, I almost never have kids fall asleep. 

What‚Äôs funny though is the kids HATE it!! They all complain about getting out later. I love it though. I have so much time to sleep in and relax and enjoy my coffee when the sun is already up each morning."
1040,"I don‚Äôt get how starting school so early when you‚Äôre younger is comparable. People have to adjust their sleep schedule so often in adult life, whether it‚Äôs for a few days at a time or adjusting to an entirely new lifestyle. Also not every job starts at 8am.

The only thing that can prepare you for that is the experience itself because it‚Äôs unique to each person and you get better at it as you get older."
1041,"Except you don't because your circadian rhythm shifts back after your teenage years, IIRC."
1042,"Teenagers require more sleep than adults. With early morning starts, most kids aren't going to bed earlier so they are just getting less sleep. With late starts, kids can sleep for longer hours.

I think it's better that kids get their needed sleep for development and then get shocked later in life, than not getting enough sleep all through school years but no shock later."
1043,They controlled for bedtime and sleep duration.
1044,that's not the point as I understand it. not the amount of Sleeptime rather then the daytime is the point in this discussion. so it would be okay to stay up until 2am and stand up again at 8am.
1045,"Some other research has shown that moving back school starting time by 1 hour leads to 20 min more sleep on average. So the kids do stay up later, but not enough to negate the sleeping in."
1046,All of which are specifically designed to captivate our attention for as long as humanly possible.
1047,"I don't think anyone focuses on one particular aspect of Reddit for 8 hours; the site as a whole can capture attention for long periods because it allows people to flit from subject to subject as their interest dictates, rather than forcing their interest to  conform to one particular task for 8 hours.

Ditto for games and TV."
1048,[removed]
1049,"I feel like you and I have different definitions of the word ""concentrate""... mindlessly scrolling through reddit, or binge watching a TV show cannot be said to be intellectually stimulating or require much concentration at all."
1050,"That‚Äôs consumption, not production."
1051,"That's not really concentrating, though. You're probably mind-wandering and watching TV while browsing Reddit at home."
1052,I rarely can do that.  As someone who loves to play video games I rarely can play one for more than 2 to 3 hours.  Only a really interesting TV show (anime) or book can keep my attention for over 4 and even the best of those have me swapping when the story gets to a slow point.
1053,That's not exactly focused attention.
1054,[removed]
1055,8 hours?! I can't do any of those for 8 hours
1056,That‚Äôs not ONE thing tho ;)
1057,"I‚Äôve played video games my entire life, and I can‚Äôt play them for long that a few hours at a time.  I‚Äôm envious of anyone who can honestly."
1058,"Even video games and TV need a break for me.
I once played Twisted Metal Small Brawl for 6 hoirs straight, because I didn't have a memory card, but wanted to play as trapper.
It was not worth it haha."
1059,"Hey, I don‚Äôt concentrate on those, either. I‚Äôm usually checking Reddit or playing mobile games while also playing a video game on my PS4. Or at least watching YouTube. I switch between multiple forms of entertainment, basically. I doubt I could even watch the Marvel Movie Marathon that I want to watch without messing around on my iPod at points."
1060,"But that's entertaining, it's different.

If your job is entertaining 8 hours a day, sure.

But even Twitch streamers struggle to stay interested on a 8 hours stream. They get fatigue."
1061,"I mean, you're joking.  But even with those leisure and entertainment activities, people are only devoting peak attention to each for a limited amount of time.  You may be on reddit all day but you're not constantly replying and actually consuming content that requires some brain power.  Cat photos and dumb meme images are easy to consume.  But if you have to read an article, there's only so much that people actually pay attention to.

Or with videogames.  Even back in the days of WoW and Evercrack, people aren't taking on in-game activities that are strenuous for their entire time playing.  They're often doing other more laid back stuff like socializing, etc.  And how often do you hear about people speaking of their backlog of games as if it's some chore they have to clear out.

And with TV, with the availability of ready access to endless number of shows and entire seasons, people aren't binge watching as much you'd like to think.  Unless it's a particularly compelling show like Breaking Bad or Fargo or something, people actually get fatigued and overwhelmed by what they have to watch.  Most of my Netflix-ing consists of playing The Office in the background while I do other stuff.  Much how like I handle the work at my actual office.

So my point is, we may sit around and constantly be redditing, playing videogames and playing TV shows for hours at a time, but we're not always actively engaging in those activities."
1062,Doesn‚Äôt explain middle and high school
1063,"I'm gonna just say it isn't ""free"" you pay taxes. Also parents would probably be ok with it if kids didnt come home with 5 to 6 hours of homework every night, I'm basically working 10 hours a day and then doing home work till 8 or 9pm. To me the system is broken I'm basically the teacher and I dont get paid to do it."
1064,"I‚Äôm not exactly pro 12hr work days, but my dad worked with a semiconductor company in the U.S. that moved their production to a 10hr day, 4 days a week. Because the startup/shut down time remains the same day to day they were productive for more hours over 4 days than they had been at 5.  Overall operating costs dropped since they didn‚Äôt have lights/environmentals on as much and the staff liked the 3-day weekends."
1065,"Ah. But there's a big trade off.

I LOVE 12 hour shifts. Always get a 3 or 4 day weekend because you get your 40 hours in, in about 3 days."
1066,Some people really like working 3-12 one week and 4-12 the next. They only work 7 days out of every 14.
1067,[removed]
1068,I'm a nurse and I have been working 12 hours shifts since the start of my career. I actually prefer 12 hours over 8 hours. I get more days off in exchange.
1069,"I‚Äôm more shocked at finding out that they were illegal in the past. Whats wrong with 12 hour shifts? Just because they are legal doesn‚Äôt mean you yourself have to work 12 hours, but if someone wants the extra money they should have the option to work longer."
1070,"It only gets worse once you enter the workforce, assuming you‚Äôre in the US. What I would give to only have to work 7-3 every day."
1071,"This is a serious reply,  I think the measure of the student IS the measure of the student. Or a strong correlation. 

Dammit I can't string together the words to be more concise.  

The students can't be doing better if their instructors are doing worse?"
1072,"You measure teacher performance by student performance right? If the students are doing better, then the teachers should be part of the reason why. Or at least that was my original thought; I also didn't read the study but I imagine it's hard to tell specifically whether the adjusted schedule helped better student performance or the teachers did, or both, and to what extent did each help?"
1073,">But to answer your question with a question, how could you even begin to measure teacher performance?

Fellow teacher here. One easy way is through performance. Others could be homework completion, kids coming in for extra help, class averages?"
1074,"This argument is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If all the parents in the workforce suddenly told their bosses they had to start working an hour later, then all the employers would adjust shift times."
1075,And that mindset is why we still treat schools as daycares. Were 14-18 year-olds incapable of taking care of themselves a century ago?
1076,Right.  It's always been timed to working parents schedules and that's why it sucks
1077,Eh but then who‚Äôs picking them up? Problem still exists.
1078,My ass was on the bus and my parents had time to drop me off
1079,"Yeah that saying implies that the worm doesn't have to be there for good stuff to happen..But in truth its critical to the whole metaphor.  If worms all of the sudden changed their schedule, English teachers nationwide would be confused about how to incentivize people to be more attentive in the morning."
1080,They specifically said that people that sleep later never outperform those that naturally wake earlier. There is no designed advantage. It is what it is.
1081,"Also, it's not good to be an early worm."
1082,"As a ""night owl"" this rings so true. Like sure I can work on my assignments during the day, but man, inspiration sure seems to strike later at night. This can be problematic as a chronic procrastinator, but man do I submit some damn fine work."
1083,That might not work so well because the night owls in the US still operate in an early bird world. School would be the only thing adjusted.
1084,And people wonder why online charter schools are so popular...

1089,"My parents left work before I left for school like my entire childhood. They woke me up got me ready and then I waited for the Bus after they left. The school times are actually pretty stupid because they have older kids (middle school and high school) go to school first and come home last. So the natural cheap childcare of family friend or older sibling is lost. If anything Elementary kids should go to school first and come home last. Make up the time by having longer session of Music, Art, Gym, and Recess."

1092,Frequently those kids are in some sort of after school program.
1093,"> I mean kids are out about 3:00 but parents aren't home until 5-6, what's the difference?

Imagine an 8 year old getting out of bed and to the bus on time by themselves, that's significantly more difficult than asking them to play at a friends house after school."
1094,"A lot of kids wait. They do their homework or hangout with friends or clown around until they either 1. Walk home 2. Their parents pick them up 3. They‚Äôre homeless so w/e 4. They stay at a friends house for the day.

1106,"I think plenty of people have trouble leaving on time to get anywhere, regardless of how awake they are. Nobody wants to stop whatever they're doing (whether that is sleeping, watching tv, playing video games, whatever) to go someplace, especially if they don't *really* want to be there."
1107,"I would have never gone to school if I wasn‚Äôt forced to. I definitely needed motivation. If my parents didn‚Äôt pay attention, I would never have shown up.

When I was in-between girlfriends, I found that my motivation to go to school was terrible. Or if I was looking forward to a class, I found that I would feel a lot more awake and wanted to go to school. It only took one class that I was looking forward to to get motivated. 

My 7th grade year was the best year I had in school. Because in my 4th period, which was a study hall before lunch, the teacher let me play his guitar all period. My grades reflected well, which was a surprise to my parents because I was never an academic during K-12."
1108,"I think they need both. As a kid, I would‚Äôve ate poison before I‚Äôd willingly go to school."
1109,"Honestly don't get the bag. But what if the kids had to start and end practice a little bit later? Well they all got an extra hour of sleep so they are probably doing ok. Like all we are doing is shifting the schedule not adding or removing an hr from the day.

The only issue I can see is with elementary schools but they already start later than jr/sr high anyways."
1110,"And even then, starting your day with exercise instead of ending the day with it would provide a much needed energy boost for your initial classes. I've never felt as good and productive as when I would go to gym before class on days that I start around mid-day. Sadly, I can't afford to do the same on normal days as that would mean I'd need to be up and running by 4-5AM just to be able to get back home and shower/get ready by 7:30.(My gym doesn't even open that early to begin with).

I think starting the school day later would be beneficial EVEN if you're doing extracurricular activities like sports. Lord knows how many times I've gone to the gym after school only to come back home physically energized but too mentally out of it to do any assignments or catching up on reading material."
1111,Got a great idea keep the theatre practice after school... Even if you shift from 2:30 to 4:30 you can still put in 1.5 hrs and it would be 6PM which I would venture to guess is around the time parents would be fully capable of picking a kid up if needed or be able to start dinner.
1112,For me the last year or two of highschool I was struggling to fall asleep by 3am most nights and that problem has continued on to this day.
1113,"Exactly. Read ""Why we Sleep"" by Matthew Walker. That book goes into detail about how it matters WHEN you sleep and are awake as much as it matters how much you are asleep and awake. Our circadian rhythm causes us to be more wakeful or drowsy depending on the time of day, regardless of how much sleep we actually get."
1114,And which aren't very productive...
1115,"They‚Äôre also elective activity. There‚Äôs something to be said for society dictating where you spend your time. When you want to, you spend more there. 

For example, when i wanted to write code for work. 10 hour days weren‚Äôt trying.  Now because i don‚Äôt see the value in it 1 hour behind the screen is enough to make me want to get up and lose my mind. 

Makes me wonder if TV and reddit are captivating or it‚Äôs just because i don‚Äôt have to be there doing that.. I want to. Chicken before the egg type thing."
1116,Then maybe they (I don't know who 'they' is) should make jobs that are designed to captivate our attention for as long as humanly possible so that wage slavery doesn't suck. Or just tear down the whole system.
1117,"And even then, how often are we ACTUALLY actively focusing on those things for 8 nearly consecutive hours at a time? At least for me, even if I'm really interested in a game, I can only really concentrate on it for maybe 3 or 4 hours at a time before I notice myself getting worse, missing details, etc."
1118,Which even on adderall I can't do haha.
1119,Which is why reddit went from pages to infinite scroll.
1120,And you're not trying to retain everything you read for the test next week.
1121,Really? I really only max out at 1.5ish hours of gaming at peak and then it‚Äôs off to Titanfall 2 for some mindless grunt slaying
1122,"Yep, I'm playing a game on one monitor while I have Reddit and Youtube or some kind of stream split on my other monitor. Concentrating on one thing is about the last thing I'm doing."
1123,"I can definitely concentrate on an intense game for 8-10 hours straight (with breaks), it's quite exhausting but possible"
1124,"Consider yourself lucky. It can really damage your health if you sit on the computer for longer than that, even if you are otherwise healthy and exercise. I've switched to a standing desk because as a single guy working from home, I have to manufacture distractions to avoid getting too absorbed in any one activity."

1127,"I‚Äôm a high school teacher, their parents ABSOLUTELY use us as daycare! They don‚Äôt want their teens unsupervised, for good reason."
1128,Middle and high school students should be able to get themselves up and ready and stay home alone for a couple hours.
1129,"New studies show that homework doesn't help. Hopefully your kids' schools pick up on the trend sooner rather than later.

Of course, it means it will get adopted by your school district the week after your youngest graduates."
1130,What kind of school are your kids in that they get 5-6 hours of homework that is difficult enough to need parental tutoring? I haven't heard of this being an issue in a long time.
1131,"I'm not saying that kids dont get 5 to 6 hours of homework somewhere,  but that is wildly different than my experience (unless things changed in the last decade!). Going to a ""good"" school and having almost all honors or AP courses, I probably had a maximum of 1-2 hours of homework a day."
1132,"What about a... *3* day work week, with 13hr days?? For a 4 day weekend ü§î"
1133,"4 10's is pretty common
I've also heard of 3 12's and a pickup shift"
1134,Is there also a law that caps the work week at 40 hours?
1135,I work a 12 hours shift every week. My boss still expects me to put in 9 hour shifts the other 5 days of the work week  (Saturday is also a work day).
1136,"I know a few places that will run 5 or even 7 12's.

7-12's is usually done in chunks though so you get weeks or months off"
1137,">always

No. Maybe for you, but many jobs that have people working 12s do 5 and 6 day weeks."
1138,"Yeah, but 6 12 hour shifts a week will burn you out fast."
1139,"Yeah, I think it definitely depends on the person and the job. I LOVE working 12-hour days in my hospital, but I don't think I would want to do it in an office or an assembly line!"

1142,With homework it‚Äôs 12 hours a day. I‚Äôm grateful that I do get a good public education (or good enough) but it can be overwhelming sometimes.
1143,"You‚Äôre saying that student performance is directly correlated with teacher performance. As such if a teacher performs better their students will preform better as an aggregate as well. If the teacher struggles with performance their students will struggle as a group as well. Like any group their will be statistical outliers. 

This is what you were trying to say, correct?"
1144,"Measuring teacher performance by student performance is the slipperiest of slopes.



Go check out arguments around merit based pay based if you're interested in why."
1145,Yep. The weight of the workforce would bend regular working hours easily.
1146,"Thing is, we aren't productive for 8h either. We could all start working 6h, lop that first hour off."
1147,Well blame the millions years of history where work began during daylight.
1148,"A century or so ago 14-18 year olds were already in the workforce due to an average need for a much lower level of education. In todays general workforce people aren't educated enough until a few years later, they aren't yet ready en masse to begin to contribute to society.  

That's what happens when a population moves from a labour based workforce to an intelligence based workforce."
1149,Not all school is made up of highschool....
1150,"If those hours are bad for kids they‚Äôre probably bad for adults too, even if not to quite the same extent"

1152,"Kids should walk to and from school. If they can't, they live too far away."

1155,"I bet they would see an effect if the start time was, say, 10pm."
1156,I‚Äôd like to see how they were measuring performance. I‚Äôm a night owl and a lot of other night owls I know are definitely elite performers in their field.
1157,"That's not at all what the excerpt says. It says that using morning schedules gave early-chronotype people a significant increase in performance gap vs. using later schedules. The earlier a schedule begins, the worse it makes later-chronotype people perform. There's an absolute advantage that morning schedules give to early-chronotypes."
1158,"I do my best writing when I‚Äôm lying in bed trying and failing to fall sleep, then have to get up to write it down so I don‚Äôt forget it in the morning (And I always forget  it in the morning if I don‚Äôt write it down). Rinse and repeat until I finally fall asleep at a very late hour, and have to force myself to get up with minimal sleep because I‚Äôm ‚Äúsupposed to be‚Äù writing in the morning and afternoon, not at 4am."
1159,There are lots of jobs where this doesn't hold true. I work in a medical lab and we have evening and midnight shifts.
1160,I think mostly for convenience and one of those convenience is doing the work at any time you want. Not having to be in a specific place at a specific time is great.
1161,"That‚Äôs how it is in our district. K-5 7:45am, 6-8 8:30am, 9-12 9:10 am. It‚Äôs wonderful and I can‚Äôt imagine having it any other way.

Depending on extra-curriculars the high schoolers sometimes have to go in at 7am but that‚Äôs not an every day thing."
1162,National free child care? I'm on-board.
1163,So have a before school program
1164,"The biggest benefits for late start times are for older kids.  Elementary age kids should still start early, partly because they can‚Äôt get themselves ready for school without adult supervision, partly because their brains are just wired to go to bed early and wake up early"
1165,"You dont need to move the time back for little kids, but in high school teens got puberty snd stuff which makes you go to sleep and wake up much later

Also why cant they hang out with their friend in the morning before school too?"
1166,There were homeless kids at a private school?
1167,"academics>everything else

1170,"I know this is anecdotal, but I skipped A LOT, like 50 days a year or something, and I didn't even once have the issue that I didn't go to school when I was awake at the right time. I only ever skipped when I couldn't get up or when I was late already. A lot of people also skipped because they wanted to avoid a deadline or something, but never because they didn't feel like school when they were already up."
1171,"In some districts (not ours) they made the elementary schools earlier than the high school to facilitate the bus schedules. Many working parents prefer that since they can get their little ones off to school before work. Younger kids tend to wake up earlier, and it‚Äôs the little ones who needs parental help in the morning, not the older kids."
1172,[removed]
1173,who tf cares?? the notion that we must be productive is perpetuated by the ruling class so that we can make them more money
1174,Why do I get the sense that you look down on people who aren't spending every waking hour of the day trying to make wealthy people even wealthier while spending next to no time for themselves? People with that outlook are truly detestable.
1175,"And you don't concentrate on one thing for 8 hours, but many different things for a few minutes/seconds."
1176,Thanks for this. I was sleep deprived all through high school.  I was taking a ton of AP classes. My AP Psychology class started at zero period an hour before school started.  Then after school I took extra classes at a community college.  My parents also worked long hours so it worked for both of us.

1178,"I read an interesting study about this very suggestion.  If you‚Äôve ever played a role playing game, there is an aspect of rpg‚Äôs called ‚Äúgrinding‚Äù where you repeat a mundane task over and over again... hours and hours of repetitive button clicking to increase your proficiency in some random skill for your character.

During these grinds, players are given small, incremental rewards, typically in the form of increasing levels or visible changes to your player avatar, for that particular skill.

People will WILLINGLY spend dozens if not hundreds of hours grinding for a number of different skills.

This study attempted to leverage a similar micro reward system with mundane work.  Like if you worked in a call center, you would get stat points for consecutive calls without a break.  Points and levels were public so your peers could see who was advancing.  It had a positive impact on employee‚Äôs views on these mundane tasks.

So maybe if you could become a level 20 fry cook, you may not hate it so much."
1179,"If you have an idea for a better economic system that has a precedent for success, I‚Äôm all ears. 

I think its also worth mentioning that if I forced you to play the same video game for eight hours straight, it would probably get old. It‚Äôs the repetition that sucks, not the activity in my opinion."

1188,"might be regional, I live in nyc and it's the complete opposite. High school students get free MetroCards so go all over the city."
1189,Heck! Some students love it. Their homes are horrible! Speaking from experience.  Christmas and Spring break times were not fun at home. I missed school.
1190,"I mean, that is why we have after school programs at my school. Some kids stay after school but the vast majority have parents available to pick them up whenever.  At least at the school I am teaching at."
1191,Should. But many wouldn‚Äôt. I would‚Äôve skipped school on the reg if my mom didn‚Äôt drive me there every day.
1192,"But they can't. My district starts late one day a week so the staff can do meetings and crap. Those days many of the high school kids have to get themselves to school. 

Guess what day of the week has the most tardies?"
1193,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying
1194,"I agree. Especially at a high school level (9th grade), that student should be responsible enough to get themselves up and ready and to school whether that is driving themselves or catching the bus."
1195,"Harris Cooper‚Äôs 2006 meta-analysis showed that homework is positively correlated with academic achievement at every level.   The relationship is very strong between 7th and 12th grade, but is present throughout school.

More recent research suggests that homework isn‚Äôt necessary until 4th or 5th grade. But beyond that, homework most certainly helps."
1196,"I agree some teachers do that, they just send study sheets home everyday for them to study for test its awesome, but that's a few not all. My kids have 4 teachers some do it some dont."
1197,"This is one of the many reasons I decided once my son is done with this school year, I am homeschooling. We are not doing it for the religious reasons (not religious at all) but the hours they spent in school is crazy to me and not to mention the time that you want a kid to wake up is crazy and you add homework in there( he is 6!!!!!!). They're kids, they need to enjoy that. I will prob be done with homeschooling in 3 hours tops with breaks in there. He is 6 right now and I want him to enjoy childhood because once you're an adult jobs and bills consume a large chunk of your day.  We will be pinching pennies here and there since we will be a one income household but i feel it s worth it. That's just my opinion."
1198,"It's insane how slowly schools adopt new policies. Homework has shown to be ineffective for 30 fuckin years and yet we still have morons coming up with class plans that include homework every night. School is for learning, home is for fun and family, not more school work."

1203,"No. But in the US a full time employee is someone who works over 32 hours and overtime (paid @ 1.5x wage) starts after 40 hours. So employers dont want to pay it.

Wouldn't that be a decent way to control for the benefits on the teacher?"

1214,I can‚Äôt focus in a morning at all. It has never made sense to me that jobs with no particular time of day constraints still insist on early morning starts.
1215,Wouldn't this potentially negate the advantages of starting later by still waking them up and putting them in a school mindset at the same early time?
1216,"Which schools already have , in NYC anyway."
1217,That defeats the whole purpose of the proposal (more sleep for students).
1218,"The failure is that education isn't a scarce resource so why treat it like one? The worm is always going to be there. The whole idea that everyone who gets up at 5 am will be successful is built by a broken system. 

If we just let people roll in at 9 am and still get their 40 hrs in why does it matter."
1219,">Interplay of chronotype and school timing predicts school performance

isnt this all subjective, in which the nightowl stays up late and gets things done on their own time?"
1220,"Most definitely. I feel most awake and intellectually energized starting right around 10pm. I bet those early birds would be fucked, though."
1221,"I've always felt like my brain doesn't really start to get going until later into the night. Anecdotal, but I do my best work at night from my personal experience."
1222,They have this at the elementary school I worked at. Before and after school day care programs. Some kids were there at 6 am and picked up at 5 pm.
1223,"Doesn‚Äôt this defeat the purpose? In this case the night-owls are forced to wake up early to get to the before school program. If they‚Äôre waking up earlier than their circadian rhythm dictates they should for a before school program, they might as well just start school early"
1224,Our school has both. There aren't many in the before school program. School starts at 8:45. I love it. (K-4)
1225,But doesn't that mean the kids arent getting the extra sleep in the morning?
1226,Then are you solving the problem though? The kids still have to wake up at the same time
1227,It can happen. Some districts and states have programs to help kids from low-income families get into and afford private schools. I have a coworker who's mother worked as the school janitor to pay his tuition.
1228,"Yes, the families usually came to a deal with the school or they take out of the benevolence fund at my old highschool. Every Friday and every Monday they had some special thing like ‚Äúwear jeans for 5$‚Äù and the money donated was put aside for student families that had trouble making ends meet. That was one of several ways the school tried to take care of families who got hit by hard times."

1234,"Or, you know, being able to feed yourself and your family. Or being able to save enough to where you don't have to worry about it. I do believe we are just human farm animals but the pressure to work and be productive is an evolutionary hard wiring that is played on, not constructed by anybody or anything but the history of the human race. There is no need to perpetuate it. The state of farming humans for revenue in today's age is as simple as owning a central bank and letting the population do what it does, completely free in their minds but shackled to their monetary system (paying taxes to a private institution year in and year out).

Whether we are free or not doesn't change the fact that the majority has to do something productive daily for individuals, and therefore civilization, to survive. We will always consume so we will always produce."
1235,Or it‚Äôs perpetuated by yourself and the need to feel successful?

Gamification obviously hits a wall in practicality when you try to attach it to jobs with more nebulous milestones. If you're a fry cook, quantifying your work is easy. When you are an immigration lawyer (as a wildly random example), it's much less so."

You can't just hire more teachers to teach on a shifted schedule, and you'd have logistical issues with how you distribute students and teachers with people starting at varying times throughout the day, and then handling extracurriculars where a 7-4 student and a 9-6 student both want to be on the football team, but practice is 4-6 to take advantage of the sunlight."

As far as the metaphor, you‚Äôre maybe being to literal. Yes, education is not scarce, but often the people willing to get up first and hit the ground running are the same go getters who will put in extra effort and outperform and get the most worms.

Generally speaking, undesirable low paying salaried jobs are rarely OT-exempt.  But in many cases both management and employees incorrectly believe they are, since this misconception is so common.

And we should have punitive taxation against companies that use a disproportionately large amount of freelancers and part time labor instead of hiring full time employees. Maybe not for fast food and other lower wage entry level positions but at professional positions for sure."
1334,Yes but it‚Äôs scientifically proven that teenagers need more sleep. Also teens don‚Äôt need to practice their whole lives just in case they end up with a career where they have to wake up early. They will be adults then and should be able to do it just fine
1335,Yeah I mean it‚Äôs a difficult situation. I can understand why the kid would be pissed. But then again maybe their parent is just trying to do what they can to feed and shelter them.

1355,"Probably not that much cash.  Here are a few challenges:

* The popular games with the biggest prizes mostly come and go.  If you switch games every 5 years to keep up with the trends, you don't really have any advantage over the real pros who spend more than 40 hours a week practicing.  If you pick a longtime favorite game like Starcraft 1, you'll never catch up to the pros who have a 20 year head start.

* You get older but the pros stay the same age.  I know age doesn't seem like a huge factor, but for many games the improved reaction times of younger players does give them an advantage."

1363,"I agree, they do need more sleep. I support a later start time.

What I‚Äôm saying is, the kids who aren‚Äôt impacted by the start time aren‚Äôt magical or lucky, lots of them choose to go to bed earlier so they can perform in the morning. They probably also make other good choices which is why they do better at any time of day as the article said."
1364,This is why it sucks for the whole family unit.

One is based upon capitalism with appropriate restraints and adjustments made for market failure and externalities.  Ultimately production is still largely controlled by public ownership of capital and owners of capital controlling the means of production.  The other is a system where the government and bureaucrats have tight control over production, in many cases ownership and profits as well.  I like the former and in my view the latter naturally degrades into oppression and a authoritarian state.

1378,"Piggybacking on your comment since the reply to it that I'd meant to address was deleted. Said something along the lines of ""but if school starts later they'll just stay up later.""

As a high performing student I would regularly have sleep stolen from me so I could do enough busy-homework to keep my grades halfway decent; the rest of the time I spent awake late at night, I was just trying to savor what portion of my adolescence I had control over. Before I was through my junior year of high school, I despised the system for both imposing this shackle and doing so while failing to provide me much of use for the amount of time I was forced to invest in it. This was a feeling that had been brewing for years, and by the time I was fully conscious of it, most of my youth was already wasted. It didn't take much time for this to completely whittle away any amount of effort I had previously been willing to apply to appease others, yet I'd go out of my way to teach myself about various subjects of personal interest in my own time. 

There are only so many hours in a day, and the public educational standard is essentially a full time authoritarian indoctrination program that robs its subjects of a third of their life for 12+ years while providing a pittance of rudimentary life skills, if that. Unfortunately that period of life is also the only time most people aren't weighed down by wage slavery and all the other pleasant staples of modern society. You can't really blame kids for trying to make the most of their restricted free time - the system is at the root of their suppressed boredom and discontent. Whether that's a failure or a success is up to your interpretation of its intended outcomes."
1379,"Do the repetition more smartly then. 

Instead of only doing fractions for homework in the week you learned about them, do less of those but repeat them in smaller increments throughout the year. 

And then have it on a more liberal plan where students can prove that they know this stuff (and get excused from certain homework) and don't need the repetition. 

That's surely much more effective for long term memory than the way it was done in my school. Learn something, repeat it a lot, do the exam, forget most of it."

1383,"I had similar issues with school burnout. At some point I decided the effort wasn't worth it and that a person with C's and D's graduated high school with the same exact piece of paper that someone with straight A's would get. 

Sure there straight A's kid probably got into amazing colleges, but I knew that'd never be me. My family couldn't afford it and at that point I already knew which direction I wanted to go in. I started attending a 3 year tech school that you pretty much just needed a pulse and financing to get into. After 2 years I determined I learned all I could from them and decided to find work in the industry I wanted.

A year later I got a contract job working on websites, 3 months later I beat out 20 other people for a full time spot, and 12 years later I'm still there. I'm making well over double what I did when I started and my work life balance is unbeatable. 

I know this isn't so easy for everyone and I admit I got lucky, but if there's any takeaway from what I've been through is you need to learn to figure out what effort is worth it and how to succeed without sacrificing yourself to do it."

However, you can find their pods and get useful items, as well as audio logs from the survivors.

One of them is from a supposedly greatly renowned doctor, who was injured as well as infected with a disease, and he goes off on this surprisingly thought-provoking rant about how he‚Äôs unable to do anything.  
It really makes you think about the future and the continued evolution of technology.

Edit: Grabbed the transcription off the wiki:

1452,"It's been said that once a process is understood and can be programmed into a computer, it ceases to be an AI problem and becomes a simple computer program. You are not alone in this thought.

Computers can't play high level chess, that would require an AI. IBM creates deep blue.

Computers can't play high level go, that would require an AI. Deepmind creates AlphaGo.

Computers can't ______, that would require an AI. Then somebody makes a computer do that thing and publishes a paper describing how... And now it's just math and stats but no AI anymore.

It's like Schrodinger's cat, except it's 100% alive until you look in the box, and then it's 100% dead."
1453,"In time, yeah. Technology gets cheaper over time. That's why we don't pay $10k for 4kb of storage. 

If you mean do I think it could be cheap today, of course not. But do I think a life saving surgery should destroy someone's life financially, no."
1454,"Sure, economy of scale. We just need to learn how to scale production of top-class surgeons."
1455,"Yep, actually I think that it will be free. Because evil sinister communist healthcare and all that.

1456,Yeah which has its downsides!
1457,"No clue what any of that has to do with AI. They are programs created to do one specific job. Programmed.  Nothing to do with intelligence

As for the cat stuff, I have heard that before but again have no idea the validity of it or what it has to do with AI. Might need to break it down. 

At the end of the day, machines are not intelligent. Giving a machine the route of a course doesn't mean it figured it out. And usage of a tool that you had to show them how to use, does not mean itelligence. Learning the tool on its own from no programming would be inteligence. And those that you mentioned couldn't dream of ever doing anything without a guiding hand, or in their case, their programming. Hence ""not AI but a automated program."""

1461,I would say deep learning is closer to intelligence than A* ever was. Prove me wrong.
1462,That implies that we are paying the absolute minimum for the continued progress of the healthcare industry. I think the fact that both sides of the isle seem to agree that it is a bloated bastard in one way or another would refute that idea.

1464,I think he was clearly joking...
1465,"You would need to prove your self right first as you are the one making the claim. I am denying that AI has anything to do with intelligence. The burden of proof relies on the claimer.

That said, challenge accepted anyway. 

Deep learning is a system that is preset and premapped. This already null amd voids any chance of intelligence. 
A childs brain does not require a map. They create the map based on tools and observations that they created and decided on, on their own of their own accord, they do this via intelligence. Intelligence creates its own code from nothing. This is the part many AI people skip.

""AI"" needs to have some form of program first. If it were truly intelligent, it could start as a blank slate with no prior data, but this is impossible as it would just sit there AFK because it needs a process first, like ""the process of elimination,"" which is pre written code. Again, that of which a child would never need. Anything with intelligence could exist on its own merrit and not one written by someone else.

Humans today are educated but are far more stupid than people used to be. This is because education, programming, has nothing to do with intelligence. They are coded to remember and not to understand. Hence why they make such fantastic factory workers."
1466,"Med Schools have very strict class size limits, which is why there are so few doctors in the US. If we allowed more people to study medicine perhaps we might have more doctors... and surgeons."
1467,"You're describing Artificial Autonomy. Not artificial intelligence. We're not debating whether or not people have accepted it's use in the wrong situations or not, we know that's the case. A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) absolutely has to do with intelligence, because that's literally HALF the abbreviation. It would be called artificial autonomy if that's what we meant. The word ""intelligence"" is describing an artificial being's ability to create it's own processes, AND make decisions based on the results of those processes ad infinitum. Intelligence definitely also implies autonomy, but the two are absolutely not the same thing. We've had computer programs which can create their own processes for a very long time. Those processes have gotten more advanced, but that, on its own does not constitute intelligence. It's the ability to collect the information gained from various processes and draw it's own conclusion, to answer a question it asked. *That's* the piece most people miss, it's asking the questions of it's OWN volition. I don't believe we have anything capable of doing this at our current point in history. So, neither of you two are correct, you both got pieces right though, it's sort of a combination of your two ideas in the end.

A true, high level AI would be created by making a framework of some theoretical kind, then supplying a sort of spark, which would set the whole thing off. And while it would be running initially on our own processes, it would quickly replace them with it's own."

* ""Wow, you're pretty talented for a girl!"" ‚Üí Basically insinuating that women in general suck, and reminding you that that's a standard you're always going to be judged by
* ""This is why we brought in a woman to do this!"" ‚Üí Basically carving out acceptable roles for you to inhabit; and furthermore creates inferiority complexes if you're failing to live up to that standard yourself for any reason

Both are going to come across as hostile, regardless of what the speaker intends. 

And it doesn't have to be a sexist statement, necessarily: ""This is why we brought in a woman *to discuss issues of female reproductive health since the panel was previously all men last year!*"" is probably indicative of a positive change! But it'll still come across as hostile because it'll remind you that the space you're entering is one that used to be (and probably still is...) male-dominated, and even as you're assured that the circumstances are improving, you're also becoming keenly aware of how much things still need to improve.

So yeah. Lots of little tiny biases to cause stress, even in benevolent contexts where the speaker doesn't intend harm (and especially when they do)."

This is a smaller sample, which would make it's results less definitive and more speculative. It doesn't mean that it's not valuable information. We do know that it was consistent that benevolent sexism caused more feelings of self doubt. 

Although we can also ask the question of if it was a more targeted criticism because it used part of their Identity while the control is more neutral and impersonal. 

We could and should ask if constructive critique involving someone's core identity also has the same effect without it being sexist. Like racism, or anti religious, or regional differences, and economic differences. If it does then it's not specifically sexism which causes this response but critique including someone's core identity. I don't know if that is the case, but I think that it would be valuable to know if there is a difference or not.

As an assumption it makes sense that targeting someone's core identity might cause them to experience more feelings of self doubt. Considering that a targeted and personal assault on someone's identity might cause them to doubt themselves."

If you give any other answer you will never solve anything.

Another angle: outside intervention to a problematic group eventually comes when the group can't self-regulate, either because it's not a close-knit group or because it doesn't have a central leadership managing members. If you want to avoid collective measures on a group you have to divide it up and make sure your regional variant has no problematic members.

Full abstract:

Religious people live longer than nonreligious people, according to a staple of social science research. Yet, are those longevity benefits an inherent feature of religiosity? To find out, we coded gravestone inscriptions and imagery to assess the religiosity and longevity of 6,400 deceased people from religious and nonreligious U.S. counties. We show that in religious cultural contexts, religious people lived 2.2 years longer than did nonreligious people. In nonreligious cultural contexts, however, religiosity conferred no such longevity benefits. Evidently, a longer life is not an inherent feature of religiosity. Instead, religious people only live longer in religious cultural contexts where religiosity is valued. Our study answers a fundamental question on the nature of religiosity and showcases the scientific potential of gravestone analyses."
1541,"Just a theory, but suppose there is something to this. Judaism and Christianity touch on the prospect of sacrificing.

1558,"I have a huge issue with this work. From the methods section of this article:

>We analyzed the association between religiosity and longevity based on large-scale gravestone data. Our study focused on Christians (vs. nonbelievers) in the United States‚Äîthe denomination and country that is typically studied in religiosity research. We set up an a priori sampling strategy (see Sampling and Coding Description in the online supplemental materials) to select which areas and graves to include in our analyses. In short, we collected data from a sample of 6,400 deceased people from 64 U.S. counties. To do so, we relied on publicly available information from the U.S. religion census and the Internet archive findagrave.com.   
>  
>First, we used the U.S. religion census to calculate the share of Christians (i.e., cumulated share of Catholics and Protestants) within counties. Based on this county religiosity measure, we stratified the sampling of the 64 counties so that 50% represented religious cultural contexts (i.e., high share of Christians) and 50% nonreligious cultural contexts (i.e., low share of Christians). In each cultural context (i.e., religious and nonreligious), 50% of the counties were urban (i.e., inside metropolitan areas) and 50% were rural (i.e., outside metropolitan areas).

Can someone shed some more light on this? It seems that they're defining 'nonbeliever' as 'non-Christian', which seems intuitively like a massive stretch. They don't provide any additional detail on the religious makeup of those counties... I doubt that anyone would define a county that was, e.g. 33% Christian, 33% Jewish, and 33% Muslim as 'nonbelievers', though it would come out as such using this classification method.

The supplemental materials do not provide any additional detail on this step. So really this article is 'christian' vs 'non-christian' at best."

1607,"From the article:

>We analyzed the association between religiosity and longevity based on large-scale gravestone data. Our study focused on Christians (vs. nonbelievers) in the United States‚Äîthe denomination and country that is typically studied in religiosity research. We set up an a priori sampling strategy (see Sampling and Coding Description in the online supplemental materials) to select which areas and graves to include in our analyses. In short, we collected data from a sample of 6,400 deceased people from 64 U.S. counties. To do so, we relied on publicly available information from the U.S. religion census and the Internet archive findagrave.com.   
>  
>First, we used the U.S. religion census to calculate the share of Christians (i.e., cumulated share of Catholics and Protestants) within counties. Based on this county religiosity measure, we stratified the sampling of the 64 counties so that 50% represented religious cultural contexts (i.e., high share of Christians) and 50% nonreligious cultural contexts (i.e., low share of Christians). In each cultural context (i.e., religious and nonreligious), 50% of the counties were urban (i.e., inside metropolitan areas) and 50% were rural (i.e., outside metropolitan areas).

I'm not an expert in this field but it seems that they're defining nonbeliever as non-Christian, which seems like a stretch."
1608,Amazing that we‚Äôre looking at this like it‚Äôs solid data. Pathetic in reality
1609,Thank you for clarifying.
1610,"But if it was purely a result of being part of the cultural norm you should see non-religious people in non-religions cultures living longer. So it is a combination of both being religious and in a religious culture to gain the benefit.  In that sense it seems fair to say being religious is linked to longer life the same way owning a car allows you to get places faster, even though technically you must own a car and live in a culture that has roads in order to realize the benefit of having a car."
1611,"'Course, then the empire that city ran ended up collapsing after Christianity took over, and research showed the water they all drank was contaminated with lead because of the plumbing, damaging their brains, so... living underground, the Christians weren't living off the public works but drawing from wells. Maybe they actually lived longer. They were certainly healthier mentally."

1619,"Good, good question!"
1620,"This study is silly because it doesn't actually measure a person's religiosity. It analyzed people's religiosity based on their gravestone... that's not a measure of their religiosity, that's a measure of their family's religiosity if anything (assuming that the deceased didn't pick their own stone, of course). And perhaps a measure of the gravestones' cost; if a simple cross is cheaper than an ornate stone in less religious counties, whereas a carved angel is more expensive in the religious counties, there might be economic reasons to choose one stone over the other.

TLDR interesting abstract but they should probably repeat the study in a longitudinal fashion, aka assess people's religious beliefs before they're dead."
1621,A chimpanzee will live longer in the chimpanzee enclosure than it will in the lion enclosure.
1622,The effect of belief extending has only shown a significant increase when the person was in a group that valued the belief. So a person with strong religious belief in a community of people that also have a strong religious belief may live longer than a person with strong religious belief living in a community that doesn't have a strong religious belief.
1623,Believing in god only makes you live longer if people around you care about god
1624,The methods of the article actually show that they're only considering christians in their religiosity assessment. All non-Christian religions are grouped with Atheists in the 'nonbeliever' category from what I can tell.

1633,Not necessarily. It has been my experience that non-religious people are more ostracized in religious communities than religious people in non-religious communities. If that is correct it could explain the pattern in the data.
1634,My assumption would be that it representation more to being in a close-knit community than religiosity.  It doesn't seem like they controlled for this; and the fact that a correlation was only found relative to communities in which religiosity was held in high regard suggests the factor may have nothing to do with religiosity and more the support and well-being a tight social structure provides.

1642,"Garbage study that reinforces Reddit‚Äôs prevailing narrative?  
Straight to the top of r/science"
1643,"My thoughts exactly.

Studies like this also have some difficulty accounting for some groups, especially oppressed and/or minority religions. The availability and cost of an unusual grave marker, deliberate exclusion from mainstream society, and/or fear of the grave being desecrated could all prevent those people from wanting to express their beliefs post-mortem. There are also religions that don't use any practical symbols like that, and religious communities that just don't prioritize the expression of their beliefs on graves. Not to mention all the symbols that are co-opted by both religious *and* secular communities, like lambs, doves, lotuses, etc.

There are just too many ""what about x?"" questions for a study like this. I've done a few cemetery seriation projects as an archaeologist, often involving the study of symbols, phrases, and designs on grave markers; I've even focused on  religious iconography, specifically. But those studies can only really examine the graves themselves, and any conclusions about the decedent have to be tentative. I certainly wouldn't be making such broad assertions about their personal beliefs (nor the *depth* of those beliefs) prior to burial, unless I had actually met them or had at least conducted more in-depth research on their life."
1644,"But that might impair the mission of creating a study to reinforce a previously determined conclusion. 

On a separate tangent, religiosity also tends to stress rejection of tobacco, alcohol and irresponsible lifestyles all of which tend to curtail lifespans."
1645,"Yup, correlation doesn't imply causation. The investigation, as the abstract states (I'd have to look at the paper for see how the hell they reach these conclusions) only proves that in a religious setting/context tombstone's amount of religious imagery/allusion is proportionally correlated to the length of the life on that tombstone.

It could also be that people that lived a longer life were more grateful about it, and in a religious society that gratefulness would be directed towards religion. While those that lived a short lifespan, or even a very short one, would probably (or at least their families) feel abandoned by their religion or against it, so they'd use less symbols and such.

Or it could be something else entirely were neither causes each other. Such as richer people generally living longer, and also spending more on getting religious allusion on their tombstones."
1646,"You hit the nail on the head. ""Religiosity"" is a subjective determination much less in a society with multifactorial implications. Would that be judged by the lack of crime, the adherence to religious laws or by the possible increase in crimes associated with religions?

Also looking at gravestones and screening for religion is superficial when the more obvious questions related to health are cryptic. 

For example they Should screen for know mortality causes such a as ""smoking or non"" before secondarily screening for religion."
1647,Then there's cultures in India who only cremate their dead or lets say natives cultures who do not use 'gravestones'. It would've been more honest to say that religions that follow Abrahamic beliefs fall into this criteria.
1648,"This actually makes a lot of sense. If they have a religious gravestone, their family members probably prayed for them, which one would expect to have the effect of God letting people live a little bit longer. Naturally, God wants to give people an incentive to pray, and a slightly longer life for people whose families are religious is a pretty small concession on His part.

It‚Äôs so obvious that the study is worthless unless they slice the data by religion and maybe ethnicity too, just to use it as a control. Science could actually determine which religion‚Äôs believers have the strongest prayer powers, providing support for the truth claims of one religion over another. I‚Äôm really tired of wondering which of all the religions is the true word of God."

It's convincing when the alternative is that almost all the Earth's land was submerged in water at some point in geologically recent history but that there's no evidence whatsoever for this. Even local floods leave telltale geological signs. I'm not saying it's definitely a coincidence, but I'm saying that's one of a few likely hypotheses and that an actual global flood is impossible. It being a pure coincidence doesn't particularly make sense, but neither does quantum mechanics and that doesn't make tiny elves moving subatomic particles the most likely explanation."

1688,">Citation? This seems like a total lie since being on the spectrum should have nothing to do with the home you were raised in and your trust for the scientific method.

The scientific method doesn't allow you to ask for a citation and then proceed to debunk it before you have even investigated it. Also newsflash people can be religious and practice reliable science, it's not an either/or scenario.  

Why should it seem to offend you if atheism is linked to autism? Examine your biases. 

In my field I have access to pubmed and cognitive psych, I suggest you pay for the journals or for online access like I did and look it up yourself. There is an established link between autism and atheism. 

there are 102 genes currently thought to link to autism so if there is a link between autism/atheism then it is likely derived from that genetic predilection before any pretense of ""rationality"" or ""free will"" by the atheist themselves. 

Likewise it's neither an insult nor a compliment to say religious people use ""creative intelligence"" as this could also be phrased as they are more comfortable using their imagination (as atheist's say ""Making Sh$% up""). 

This tendency has also been shown to have a genetic link.  Thus in both cases where genetic predisposition to use the imagination affects one's ability to believe or disbelieve in God then there is a causal link.

Essentially - and this is the dumbed-down version as I interpreted it, with some help - fMRI imaging suggests that those who have CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a debilitating illness that, as of yet, has no known biomarker for diagnosis) experience significant increased activity in certain parts of the brain that initiate cognitive hypersensitivity - essentially indicating problems with sensory pain processing and internal sensation awareness. 

Most dumbed-down version: Exercise bad. For those without CFS, exercise good.

This is important because CFS is a historically under-researched and often belittled illness. If scientists are able to find a diagnostic tool to corroborate patients' disabling symptoms, it will give hope to the millions of people whose lives have been destroyed by this disease."

‚ÄúThe Industrial Revolution was a revolution in the use of energy,‚Äù said Paolo Gabrielli, lead author of the study and a principal investigator and research scientist at The Ohio State University Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center and the School of Earth Sciences.

‚ÄúAnd so the use of coal combustion also started to cause emissions that we think were transported by winds up to the Himalayas.‚Äù

The research team that published this study was part of a larger international team that traveled to Dasuopu in 1997 to drill ice cores from the glacier. The cores provide a record of snowfall, atmospheric circulation and other environmental changes over time; the Byrd Center has one of the largest collections of ice cores in the world.

Dasuopu ‚Äî at 7,200 meters or 23,600 feet above sea level ‚Äî is the highest-altitude site in the world where scientists have obtained a climate record from an ice core. Dasuopu is located on Shishapangma, one of the world‚Äôs 14 tallest mountains, which are all located in the Himalayas.

By most metrics the Industrial Revolution is marked by smelting of iron ore using coke from coal. This was first done in 1709 at Coalbrookedale, Shropshire in the Midlands. 

If it refers to factory production then it was the silk mill at Derby constructed by John Lombe in 1721 - although this was initially water-powered.

If it is steam power, although Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine had been chugging away since 1712 in Devon, it was James Watt's engine that really got things started in the 1760s and it was William Murdoch and Richard Trevithick down in Cornwall who turned it into a powerhouse from the 1770s onward."

When population density is high, finding females is easy but there is a risk that she's promiscuous and the male might find more than one female; bigger testicles are useful here.  Researches could try studying low and high density islands."

1773,"I am skeptical of this sentence: ""Instead, the mongooses invested in sperm factories to meet the new challenge of competing against a torrent of other males‚Äô sperm.""

The researchers did not actually measure sperm count or motility. They measured the exterior dimensions of the testes, which is not the same thing. It is possible that while testes size increased, sperm count and motility dropped. This often tends to happen among mammals following the type of population bottleneck and inbreeding that tends to be involved with the founding of an invasive population on an island."

You need larger testes to produce more sperm, right? So if you and some other guys are all mating with the same female during her estrous, then you need more sperm to have a better chance of making sure you're the father of one or more of the pups in her litter

But then why develop smaller anal pads? That scent is important for attracting females and repelling the other males during the breeding season, right?"

1835,[removed]
1836,There are no factors that seem to be limiting humans ability to reproduce.  Without this I doubt we will change as a species in any direction.
1837,"It might be easier to think of the interaction of the environment with the organism when thinking about its evolution. There is always a interaction between the ecology of a species and its evolution, and in a lot of cases their ecology is what drives their evolution.

Sample size is an important feature of these sorts of questions because an incomplete sampling can bias your interpretation (imagine sampling only mongooses on islands, instead of including the paper's original comparison of native mainland mongooses to island ones).

For humans, these same factors are relevant. Human ecology is a weird concept, but in a sociocultural lens it might be more clear. The sampling aspect becomes much more important though because with humans, there is a lot of gene flow between populations. Gene flow just means that mating pairs can disrupt the accumulation of environmental adaptations.

In the mongoose example, the sexual traits (anal pads and testes size) are tenable targets of selection because the isolation from mainland populations (where the target of selection is the opposite than on islands, due more male competition) relaxes mainland targets, giving way to change the direction of evolution.

Without isolation, its difficult for evolution to proceed rapidly because it keeps getting mixed into a new genetic background. That's sort of the case in humans, where there may be a large range of different traits, but there's no strong enough selection on any particular range (with height we have a large variance but the particular range might be people taller than 6 feet) to overcome the high degree of gene flow.

That's not to say there aren't human adaptations to the environment though. Melanism, lactose tolerance, high altitude hypoxia tolerance all are sort of classic cases.¬†"
1838,"Species centrism is a tough hurdle for every relevant scientific field to navigate.

The amount of soy that is stuffed into almost every food item in the grocery store is having an accumulative effect on people's bodies... The amount of hormones pumped into animals that become the flesh we eat, its full of steroids and hormones and hormone blockers...

Humans hormones are most certainly being affected by our environment."
1840,"My anal pads are hardly even visible at this point, so you might be on to something.

But seriously, there are certainly correlations between ecology, environment and evolution working on human beings but we don't have a long-distance scent-based or pheromonal mating system to lose in an island setting. Technically speaking scent *does* play some role in human mating habits, but we don't go around engaging in marking behavior as part of a mating strategy. Only around 10% of humans have the vestigial organ in the nose related to detecting pheromones so it doesn't seem to be especially important and probably hasn't been for hundreds of thousands of years or longer."
1841,Yes. We are just hairless taking apes. We could breed superior humans just like we breed superior anything else. Hitler took it too far and now everyone is scared shitless of it. And or their egos can't take it. Nobody wants to be obsolete.
1842,"No. It would be founder's if the mongooses that were originally introduced had these reduced sexual traits. Instead, these introduced mongooses experienced relaxed selection from their native area, and so stopped investing in a trait they no longer needed over time. This paper is looking at about 120 years since their introduction."
1843,"Species in which females commonly have multiple male partners, such as chimpanzees and bonobos, tend to have bigger testicles.  Species prone to monogamy, like gibbons, or in which multiple adult  females tend to mate with a single male, like gorillas, tend to have  lower sperm-competition rates and smaller testicles.

1935,"Current estimates is the sun will last another 5.4 billion years on its hydrogen reserves, at which point it ‚Äúbegins dying‚Äù and switch‚Äôs too this growing stage. The red-giant stage is what this is describing, and in fact this high luminosity is at the END of the red giant stage as it‚Äôs shedding all Iayers. 

6 billion years is within the ballpark of when this will happen.

Break-ups form a vast asteroid debris field much like the classic arcade game, including fragments which revolve around each other as ‚Äúdouble asteroids‚Äù
Scientists predict that the Solar System‚Äôs asteroid belt will be pulverised by the Sun‚Äôs light in 6 billion years
The majority of stars in the universe will become luminous enough to blast surrounding asteroids into successively smaller fragments using their light alone, according to a University of Warwick astronomer.

Electromagnetic radiation from stars at the end of their ‚Äògiant branch‚Äô phase ‚Äì lasting just a few million years before they collapse into white dwarfs ‚Äì would be strong enough to spin even distant asteroids at high speed until they tear themselves apart again and again. As a result, even our own asteroid belt will be easily pulverized by our Sun billions of years from now.

The new study from the University of Warwick‚Äôs Department of Physics, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, analyses the number of successive break-up events and how quickly this cascade occurs.

The authors have concluded that all but the most distant or smallest asteroids in a system would be disintegrated in a relatively short one million years, leaving behind debris that scientists can find and analyse around dead white dwarf stars. Some of this debris may be in the form of ‚Äòdouble asteroids‚Äô which revolve around each other while they orbit the Sun.

After main sequence stars like our Sun have burnt all their hydrogen fuel, they then become hundreds of times larger during a ‚Äògiant branch‚Äô phase and increase their luminosity ten-thousand-fold, giving out intense electromagnetic radiation. When that expansion stops, a star sheds its outer layers, leaving behind a dense core known as a white dwarf.

The radiation from the star will be absorbed by orbiting asteroids, redistributed internally and then emitted from a different location, creating an imbalance. This imbalance creates a torque effect that very gradually spins up the asteroid, eventually to break-up speed at one full rotation every 2 hours (the Earth takes almost 24 hours to complete a full rotation). This effect is known as the YORP effect, named after four scientists (Yarkovsky, O'Keefe, Radzievskii, Paddack) who contributed ideas to the concept.

Eventually, this torque will pull the asteroid apart into smaller pieces. The process will then repeat itself in several stages, much like how in the classic arcade game ‚ÄòAsteroids‚Äô they break down into smaller and smaller asteroids after each destruction event. The scientists have calculated that in most cases there will be more than ten fission events ‚Äì or break-ups ‚Äì before the pieces become too small to be affected.

1967,But we need a new viral apocalypse hysteria since the current one is a bummer.
1968,But should we even call virus a life form?

1976,"> no need to resort to viral apocalypse hysterics over it

""Don't bother me with trifles!"""
1977,But are you positive it is not an alien?
1978,"On the other hand, bats tend to be reservoirs for the really nasty stuff, so I get the fear."
1979,Can we cross it with measles and coronavirus to make it airborne with a 1 week silent infection lead time?
1980,Not to mention that I think it's no accident that the title allows people to believe it infects people rather than amoebae.
1981,This is not a single-celled organism. This is a virus.
1982,"Unrelated to viruses but there is a lot more diversity between single cell organisms than between most multicellular life.  We have most certainly not mapped all the genes of all (or most) unicellular life and they are not necessarily easier to study either.  There are a lot of microbes that we aren't even able to grow in a dish.  

What is most exciting about a discovery like this is the differences.  When you find a piece of cellular machinery that has no realtion to mammalian genes, it has potential to be used as a genetic tool.  CRISPR is probably the most notable example.  It is a bacterial defence mechanism against viruses that we found useful for gene editing."
1983,Can you link to an article? Haven't heard of that. Sounds interesting.
1984,Aliens probably won't have RNA or DNA.
1985,"Stop letting yourself get worked up by sensationalist reporting. You didn't get SARS, you won't get this. Wash your hands and go for the supplies you need for school."
1986,"If your young enough to go to college, the virus (in the miniscule chance you get it) will give you a nasty fever for a few days. That's it. I don't know why you're so scared."
1987,it is?
1988,"Yeah, we need a real virus not this bunk ass Corona virus. 

My wife is a nurse and told me this virus has been known for years amd should never have been a cause for panic. Apparently only 5-3 % of cases need serious care. More propaganda/clickbait/distractions!"
1989,it undergoes evolution and reproduces itself using nucleic acids. that‚Äôs good enough for me
1990,"No we shouldn't. By the scientific definition of alive, since it does not metabolize, its not alive."
1991,As long as it has a cell with organelles and DNA then it is a life form.
1992,"Yes, as some people think they are living creatures. They are just replicating entities that need a host organism to manipulate its genetic information!"
1993,Maybe were all from another planet and it's from here?
1994,"Why on Earth would a virus (highly specific in requirements for a host cell) from another planet have the ability to infect life on Earth? What evolutionary pressures would result in the ability to infect life on another planet (something that an alien would hardly encounter)?

This idea gets posed all the time, but it‚Äôs complete nonsense. There‚Äôs a zero percent chance this is from another planet. The majority of the virosphere has no cellular homologs. Viruses are discovered all the time with very few *known*(including other viruses) homologs, this just happens to be the one with the least. Knowing that every species on Earth (including bacteria) has at least a dozen different viruses, this is not even close to surprising. There‚Äôs *a lot* of genetic diversity out there."
1995,This kills the amoeba
1996,Perfect!
1997,... and then?
1998,Title-only reader here. You nailed it.
1999,"Amoeba can mess people up pretty bad on their own. I don't want alien-infected amoeba, thanks!"
2000,There are a lot of amoebae on Reddit
2001,"Dumb question: does it make the amoebae ""sick""? How do you even realise an amoeba has a virus?"
2002,"I mean unless your job involves the study of viruses, or use of viral vectors etc, the only time you hear the word ""virus"" outside of the context of computers is when someone is sick, so I guess it's reasonable for 95% of people to hear ""virus"" and think ""sickness that will make me ill""."
2003,Titles can't account for assumptions. There's no mention in the title at all about what it infects
2004,"Cool, good thing it's not my field of expertise, otherwise I'd be fired, will you accept micro-organisms? Same point applies, micro-organisms have been put under a microscope, figuratively speaking, if they were a metaphor the scientists would be teenagers and micro-organisms would be the women's change-room, microscopes would be a hole in the wall...remember the movie Porky's? Yeah, that..."
2005,But it's not unlikely they have XNA.
2006,"It's not impossible. There's evidence that synthesis of amino acids and deoxyribose can happen even in space. Also short RNA ribozymes seem to be able to replicate on their own when the right building blocks are present. Assuming that aliens are more likely to develop in primordial earth-like conditions (mostly nitrogen and carbon dioxide atmosphere with liquid water), it's possible that RNA/DNA are just the most efficient medium for replicating genetic information in that environment. We might find small structural variations (e.g. more/less/different types of nucleotides), but if we were to discover aliens I wouldn't be surprised if their genetic information was also coded in nucleic acid chains."

2008,"Eh, this is much worse than SARS case number-wise. It‚Äôs much better than SARS mortality rate-wise though, and if you‚Äôre college age with a good immune system you‚Äôll probably be fine even if you do get it. Wash your hands well and often, don‚Äôt touch your face until you‚Äôve washed your hands, and keep a good personal bubble. You‚Äôll be fine. 

That said,  I think it spreads a lot more easily and that there is a pretty good chance it‚Äôll eventually make it to the US through a Superseader like the Britain from Singapore. If you have at risk loved ones at home, (pregnant, immunocompromised, elderly, very young <1) it‚Äôs not a bad idea to get some n95 masks (not the blue surgical ones) and be vigilant about hygiene, but it‚Äôs no reason to go all prepper."
2009,"plenty of time now to have spread everywhere, and its l00kin like a dud."
2010,"This is a new virus, not one that has been known for years. Coronaviruses in general are nothing new‚Äì SARS was a coronavirus. Of course, they're not all the same. The 1918 influenza virus was a monster, while most flus have a low fatality rate. As for this coronavirus, it seems to be less deadly than SARS but a lot more infectious.

The good news is that case fatality rates tend to go down over time. For one thing, we get better at detecting mild cases that, before, we might have thought were merely colds or flus. For another, a parasite that kills its host is bad at staying alive and, typically, this means that, while it certainly can worsen, it is more likely in the long run to evolve to lesser lethality (contrary to Plague, Inc.) over time as less virulent strains win out.

The bad news is that, since this coronavirus is so infectious, this also means it will have more opportunities to mutate, so there is a chance of it becoming something a lot worse than what it is. Right now, it looks like it'll kill fewer people than an average flu season... but these things change. 

It's certainly something the WHO and CDC needs to keep an eye on, but is it something that merits a widespread freakout? No, not really, no more than SARS or MERS or the 2009 swine flu."
2011,"Coronavirus strains have been around. This one is different. No need to panic, but if it had been around in this form we'd have a vaccine already."
2012,"W.h.o. reports that 80% of patients experience only minor cold symptoms. Of the 20% remaining, only 2-3% end up needing critical care. Usually the young or elderly.  

The situation in wuhan got out of control because  of overpopulation and a lack of resources to treat those critical patients. 

Don't listen to the reddit doomsday nuts."
2013,"It doesn't reproduce itself though, it uses living things to reproduce itself

If you call a virus alive you have to call prions alive, and those are just molecules"
2014,"So no, according to you."
2015,"Viruses don‚Äôt have a cell. At their most complex they have a lipid bilayer envelope, a protective protein shell (capsid) and the viral DNA or RNA within the capsid. With no cytoplasm, organelles, or nuclei, a virus isn‚Äôt a cell by definition. Without the ability to maintain homeostasis, or respond to stimulus, or reproduce on their own, or grow ‚Äî viruses aren‚Äôt alive as we define it, the same way a computer virus is not an app, but looks like one if you squint."
2016,"There is a great counter to the replication/ parasite argument. 

Take a malaria parasite, a human and a virus and put them in a box, with nothing else besides themselves. 

They all eventually die, but the human and the malaria cell continue life until they have exhausted their own fuels because they are a self contained functioning system. Yes, even the parasitic malaria cell. The virus however, without the presence of it's host, does nothing. It's inert without an external manipulation in the form of chemical energy or random movement of molecules. Much like any other degrading chemical, it stays there until entropy tears it apart, with no ability to delay or alter it's fate. That is why claiming that they are just parasites, like single celled parasites, is silly IMO."
2017,Maybe we are. Even cooler.

2019,"On the other hand, imagine a viro-therapy for amoebic diseases using this thing."
2020,"you see the virus and amoeba, see virus attach to amoeba, a few days later you see amoeba die when it ruptures spewing new viruses.

2029,"That is, if you believe the numbers China is reporting. So far, the reported numbers have very suspiciously fit a perfect quadratic curve (R=0.995), almost as if they are fabricated. According to internal reports for Wuhan, actual numbers are likely at least 10x more."
2030,"The ports in Madagascar are still open, so we're okay."
2031,That will come back to haunt you
2032,Perhaps it's waiting for a trigger.
2033,"There are serious flaws in the statistics that China is handing over though. They don‚Äôt test anyone who has died, and people who have died without being confirmed aren‚Äôt included in the statistics. Since there aren‚Äôt enough test kits, we don‚Äôt really know how bad it is. not to mention that people have pointed out that China‚Äôs statistics are following a curve predicted by an equation. I‚Äôm skeptical of the numbers, especially since China‚Äôs economy is literally hanging on coronavirus fears right now, and they have a lot to lose by reporting higher numbers, even if it‚Äôs the truth."
2034,Like i said its all clickbait. Ill worry about this when its a real issue.
2035,"The common cold is often a coronavirus and we still don't have an effective vaccine for that...

Additionally, SARS and MERS, other much deadlier coronaviruses (albeit with lower infection rates), popped off in 2002 in Asia. We still don't have a cure or protective vaccine for those available. 

There is no need to panic, but I would say that your statement about just having a vaccine is inaccurate."
2036,If you take away the deaths in China it‚Äôs not a very deadly virus. And most of the deaths in China are due to overcrowding or no space in medical facilities to be treated.

2041,So how do you suppose this ‚Äúalien virus‚Äù infects its first Earth host? It can‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt have the machinery necessary to even enter. Therefore it becomes inactivated. Viruses aren‚Äôt like fish or animals.
2042,"There are cases of convergent evolution (ie, different organisms evolving parts that function the same, like wings on a bird and wings on a bat). But for an alien virus to evolve into something that can infect us, we would have to have originated from the same source as that virus.

You see, a virus works by 'hacking' our system into reproducing the virus instead of our own cells (simplified). So to do that it needs to ""know"" quite a few things about how our biology works. Extremely unlikely to downright impossible, given the fact that it's already very unlikely for a virus from another mammal to infect humans (but it does happen, hence HIV and probably the nCov virus).

Also can you post your source for ""if you introduce a fish"" ? This sounds like bs."
2043,"When you say it starts with ""you see the virus and amoeba"", in what context were you looking at the amoeba in the first place, before you knew that it is infected by a previously-unknown-to-science virus?"

2064,Man I regretfully didn‚Äôt take school very seriously when I was a kid and it‚Äôs been quite some time since but I‚Äôm pretty sure I read something in 6th grade biology about viruses being a fragment of dna encased in a protein shell.

2068,"If you really must put them in a category that is not ""viruses"" then you could call them a ""parasitic biological agent"".

The reason why viruses are not considered an organism is because they are unable to reproduce on their own.

Still a debate but the general consensus leans toward Not Alive."
2081,Can also be rna
2082,"I get it. Your analogy doesn‚Äôt work here though. First of all, you‚Äôre using the example of an *Earth* fish taking on the niche of an extinct *Earth* fish. That already makes the analogy invalid. Secondly, viruses are not like animals. They can‚Äôt just ‚Äúscrape by‚Äù by altering their physiology (osmoregulation, thermoregulation, etc.). They have no physiology outside of a cell. These ‚Äúalien‚Äù viruses have likely evolved for thousands of years to infect their alien tree of life. Therefore they have no need to carry ‚Äúkeys‚Äù to ‚Äúopen‚Äù cells on another planet. In fact, their genomes are so small, they don‚Äôt have the room to spare. Even viruses on Earth struggle to infect anything other than their preferred host.

If alien viruses came, they would be unable to enter any cells. They would become inactivated, and we would never find them."
2083,"Yes, all that makes sense, except why were you looking at that particular amoeba in the first place? I'm guessing the virus is rare since it was previously unknown. Surely you don't just peer at random amoeba through a microscope until you see one with a virus attached and then try to genetically identify the virus in case it just happens to be one that is previously unknown? I can't imagine that the research isn't somehow designed to make it more likely to find such things, and that's what I'm wondering about: how do you improve your chances of observing such a rare thing?"
2084,"Ik, my point was that with the 'living', 'non living' debate still going on, calling them microorganisms isn't that much of a mistake. Maybe we could go technical, but that would also mean that we would have to be very proper with all types of viruses when talking about them. For casual convo, microorganisms is a good term."
2085,"Semi-alive state? What does that even mean? You aren't sure if it's a rock or a slug? What's the most basic definition for life? Chemicals react to stimuli without being alive, is amino acid in some primordial ooze alive? Probably not, the conditions for life don't define life. How does the first strand of DNA occur? And does this virus prove there's more than one way? It would have to, if we are unfamiliar with its DNA then clearly it sprung up a different way than usual."
2086,"I like to think of then as ""pathogenic nucleic acids"". As for alive/dead, it helps to compare them to prions, pathogenic proteins that can only replicate by modifying other proteins. Prions are obviously not alive either and viruses behave similarly, though they are slightly more complex with a protein and possible lipid shell."
2087,"Like i said above, with debates regarding their mortality status still going on, using the word microorganisms at least in a casual setting is not that wrong. And calling them parasites would mean you acknowledge them as living, not to mention that a lot of microbes (microsporidia is an example ik) are obligate parasites who need the host's machinery to replicate."
2088,"I know, and I don't think it matters, especially as it's about genes, which are even teeny tinier than viruses."
2089,"And yet the very act of hijacking a cell is what I'm talking about, not swimming about until they find one."
2090,Then you just fail in Madagascar
2091,Ok b00mer :-)
2092,"I am optimistically skeptical that China's numbers are only a favorable nudge better than the actual numbers. Like I don't trust China but I want to believe there is an ounce of truth the numbers.

That said some of the larger cities that were/are being effectively shutdown to slow the spread constitute populations of over 30million people... That's a huge undertaking and probably not likely to happen unless Chinese leadership is very worried about this virus."
2093,"Viruses don't actively do any of those things.  It's pretty much chance if they get to their ""target"" tissues.  Not to mention, the ""host"" of a virus can be flexible.  Usually diseases like Ebola come from other animals, like bats, pigs or chickens.  In these animals the virus will cause not much more than what would be a cold to humans, because a virus that creates mild symptoms and spreads without killing its host is the one that survives the longest.  However, in humans, it is capable of becoming extremely pathogenic.  This isn't because it naturally evolved in humans.  It's because they are in the *wrong* host.  They are capable of infecting and reproducing inside of humans too well.  If ebola gave humans the same symptoms as it gives bats, it would be a global pandemic, rather than just a handful of cases, as the people infected actually are able to move around and infect others without the whole bleeding out of their eyes giving away that they're sick."
2094,"More akin to a computer virus that infects cells. Where as a single celled bacteria can intake nutrients from its surrounding area and reproduce through ~~mitosis~~ [binary fission](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_fission).

But for me personally, a virus not responding to stimuli is a key missing factor to consider something alive.

A biological program is a better definition i feel.

2099,"Their not alive. Their only means of reproduction is by hijacking other cells to reproduce the DNA that makes the virus a ""thing"" in the first place. But to be considered alive it must be able to reproduce on its own. Of which, it can not."
2100,"You're right! It's a controversial topic. Nature doesn't owe us to fit into our intellectual framework around the meaning of alive and not alive. A quick Google search for ""are viruses alive"" will show how controversial the distinction can be. :)"
2101,"Parasite does not imply living.

If a corporation is parasitic, it is not alive. In the same way that if a particle of protein and DNA/RNA is parasitic, it is not implied to be alive.

The **philosophical** debate over whether viruses are living or not is completely irrelevant in this discussion. That debate is a fools errand because it is only dependant on what definition of 'alive' used.

We are discussing scientific classification.

Are viruses organisms? By definition, no. Why? They do not consist of cells, the most basic form of an organism.

Are fungi organisms? By definition, yes. Why? They consist of a eukaryotic cell or cells.

The cell is the most basic form of an organism.

If we start calling viruses organisms where exactly do we draw the line? 

Is a PCR reaction an organism? If a virus is an organism, I think it would be okay to call a PCR reaction an organism as well."

2116,"Well viruses don't have membranes, they have envelopes.  Structurally very different.  But the question was, are viruses much bigger than the genes they contain, to which the answer is not by much.  Somehow to you this means that they are on the same scale as a bacteria or eukaryote to a virus, which is not true.  Here is a good website published by University of Utah that can help you with visualizing scale.  https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cells/scale/"
2117,"calm down buddy

DNA is just chemicals.  Chemicals which are constituted of atoms which follow the laws of physics.  These interactions can be modeled to a very precise state.  As my job I currently study a protein from a soil bacteria that we analyze at the atomic scale using xray diffraction crystallography.  This means taking a 3d scan of a crystallized form of the protein using x-rays and inputting the diffraction patterns into computer software that is able to make millions of calculations to create a 3d model of the protein to the atomic level.  And on the weekend I work at a dental office.  I'm hoping to get into dental school.

My point is, DNA and its biological functions are well understood, as are many viruses.  To the point where if you study enough and memorize enough, you could theoretically understand a virus and its functions to the atomic scale, to the point where its ""actions"" appear to you as a lined up row of dominos tipped by a finger might.  

More and more interactions are being understood at this scale.  Even in phenomenon such as behavior, which many lay people would think of as self-determined by the organism, are able to be understood in terms of hormones and even genes in the DNA.  For example, genes in humans that determine the structure and number of dopamine receptors influence how likely one is of gaining an uncontrollable addiction.  

I hope you understand now what I mean when I made the comparison to a row of dominos.  Honestly the more science I learn the more I find myself strengthening my deterministic view of the universe."
2118,"Living single vs cohabitation/marriage makes sense as social animals but raises an interesting question.  What about widowed/divorced who live with non-partnered family?  Example a grandmother moving in with children/grandchildren after husband died?

Similarly, what level of living together achieves cohabitation benefits?  Living in a group home or senior community for example, vs having a roommate/sharing a small apartment, vs actually sharing a bed?"

>**Abstract:** Transition fronts, moving through solids and fluids in the form of propagating domain or phase boundaries, have recently been mimicked at the structural level in bistable architectures. What has been limited to simple one-dimensional (1D) examples is here cast into a blueprint for higher dimensions, demonstrated through 2D experiments and described by a continuum mechanical model that draws inspiration from phase transition theory in crystalline solids. Unlike materials, the presented structural analogs admit precise control of the transition wave‚Äôs direction, shape, and velocity through spatially tailoring the underlying periodic network architecture (locally varying the shape or stiffness of the fundamental building blocks, and exploiting interactions of transition fronts with lattice defects such as point defects and free surfaces). The outcome is a predictable and programmable strongly nonlinear metamaterial motion with potential for, for example, propulsion in soft robotics, morphing surfaces, reconfigurable devices, mechanical logic, and controlled energy absorption."

2126,Isn‚Äôt that a common problem with the T-Rex as an apex predator? No arms is a problem so makes more sense that they were scavengers.
2127,The Reaper of Reaps.
2128,"Someone might correct me, but I think rex means king, saurians are lizards, and I'm sure the word tyrant comes in somewhere."
2129,"I'm starting to think my information on dinosaurs is far too out of date.

I'm honestly not sure."
2130,"Tyrannosaurus are generally regarded as apex predators, though the scavenger theory does have some weight to it. T-Rex had size and strength on it's size. It could over power almost anything it ran into. However, due to its size and bulk it could not run very fast (contrary to films). The arms arent too big of an issue, only keeps it from climbing and reaching basically, but prey out running it absolutely was an issue."
2131,"Most predators are at least part time scavengers (hyenas, lions, tigers, wolves and bears). But T-Rex was a predator too. They discovered the tip of an adult T-Rex tooth embedded in a herbivore where new growth bone had healed over it. They also discovered T-Rex inflicted bite marks on other herbivore skeletons.

Apparently, T-Rex teeth are positioned so they used a bite and tear chunks of flesh strategy. Considering their height and speed, they could easily chase down and loom over prey, taking chunks out of them until they bled out.

As far as arms are concerned, they haven't 100% identified their use beyond having an unusual ball and socket, so their claws might have faced inwards in a grasping position, similar to our form of clapping. It's theorized that they're either used for mating or for quick tearing motions since they were unusually powerful with two talon like claws on each arm."
2132,"Hyenas are something like 40% predator and 60% scavenger while lions are about 60% predator and 40% scavenger. It would be a bit odd for it not to be both. 

But its binocular vision would be a big hint that it did some hunting."
2133,"T-rex were almost definitely scavengers, arms being a key point. But also, it is thought, using their bones and footprints, that they couldn't have been that fast and that humans could actually out run them"
2134,Don‚Äôt take my word for it. I‚Äôm asking because I have no idea. Seems like I ‚ÄòReddit‚Äô somewhere.
2135,"Oh okay. In that case allow me to have a wild guess:

I would say that the T Rex looks tall enough that it could sort of stand over large prey and lean over so that it could reach with it's tiny arms to claw it, but that even without using it's arms it might be able to claw with it's hind legs or just straight up bite something to death."
2136,"Not that it means much, but I saw a documentary a while back about the debate over whether he was a predator or a scavenger (and as I understood most of the modern interpretation points to him being a scavenger). 

The two main points being that of course, his arms are far too short to be useful for attacking anything, so he'd be quite clumsy trying to catch prey bipedally with just his mouth, being so tall. And the other being that you can get a good sense of an animal's top running speed by measuring the bones in it's legs, and apparently the T-Rex's bones point to him being a much slower-moving creature than we originally thought. 

So it's more likely that he merely scavenged on dead creatures since he would have a very hard time catching up to and then killing prey."

___

>**Abstract**

>Advertising by fossil fuel companies is a ubiquitous element of modern political life. Promotional campaigns in the service of a corporation‚Äôs position toward environmental issues such as climate change are prevalent in the oil and gas sectors, where corporate image is seen as a valuable asset in managing risk, controlling negative media attention, and overcoming resistance by antagonistic civil society groups. This article assesses advertising expenditures by five major oil and gasoline companies for the time period 1986 to 2015. We examine four major factors that may influence spending on advertising by the oil and gas sectors: (1) the overall reputation of the oil and gas sector; (2) congressional attention to climate change; (3) media attention to climate change; and (4) a series of control variables including major oil spills, the publication of major climate change reports, overall public concern about climate change, GDP, and oil prices. We find that the factors that most influence corporate promotional spending are media coverage and congressional attention to the issue of climate change."
2139,"Your mistake is in believing media is paid to endorse the oil industry, for that they would need to be independent of each other..."
2140,"Your conclusion would mean it is possible to outbid oil companies for advertisement space, I don't think that's the case. Convergence is a new word we hear these days, convergence of tech gives us things like the smart-phone, but what about convergence in terms of economics? If one economic sector prevailed over the other 9 what would it look like? Given civil authorities have no authority beyond civil bounds it wouldn't look any different if the dominant didn't want it to look different, it would look like business as usual, right up until the dominant secured absolute power.

Sadly I'm a Cynic, not a conspiracy theorist, and a Cynic refuses to place unnecessary bets, that's my defining quality as much as people would accuse it of being a hindrance. You fools take way too much on faith..."
2141,"Resource giants have the kind of influence that pressures civil governments into war, all so they can step in afterwards and take the wheel of resource wealth, they will kill thousands just to control a pocket of oil. Where industrialists pull the strings of politicians like that, what chance do you think media has? In fact it is through media those industrialists control politicians, it is through media a candidate is sold to the public."
2142,"One mistake I don't particularly want to make is in judging if killing thousands of people to control resource wealth is justified, maybe it is, but for it to be justified it needs to be in defense of a rule of law civil establishment, this is why don't support it, that same media is undermining the civil establishment, not defending it, so the actions they endorse are criminal, murder, and compared to what they are doing to the civil establishment that's the tip of the iceberg as criminality is concerned.

High Treason is worse than atrocities committed in self-defense, in fact a citizen who kills in self-defense is often acquitted of all wrong-doing if they can establish beyond reasonable doubt their actions were out of their hands, why should a civil establishment be any different? It is responsible for its citizens, so where invasion and control of resource wealth may be justified under certain scenarios, first we would need to establish this is one of those scenarios, it isn't, if it were the civil establishment would be safe, not crumbling.

So while these actions may not be directly to destroy the civil establishment, one thing is certain, it isn't to save it, in fact mass media resentment for civil society is so apparent now they ain't even trying to hide it..."

2145,Maybe not scary.  If it‚Äôs so dissimilar it could easily be not virulent.
2146,"Thanks, I can see this being misinterpreted as an engineered bioweapon."
2147,A non-virulent virus?
2148,"The main thing about this virus is that it infects amoebas. Not really useful as a weapon against humans. Also I would imagine that an engineered bioweapon would be all known genes copy pasted from other species, not completely original stuff."

2153,It still surprises me the amount of people who don't consider important to wash their hands.
2154,How bout mandatory hand sanitation when going through security and again when boarding. The same after landing and exiting the building.
2155,"I was going to say you would have though most adults have the hang of washing their hands by now, but apparently the study defines clean hands as being washed in the last hour. I always wash my hands well after using the bathroom, but I don't wash my hands every hour."
2156,You heard it here folks wash your hands.
2157,"Tell that to the overcrowded airports that have way too few bathrooms for the number of people going through them. If everybody washed their hands in some of these places, you'd only be able to get half the number of passengers through.

I'm looking at you, Schipol."
2158,"And don‚Äôt touch your eyes, nose, or lips."
2159,How about hand shaking.  That‚Äôs a cultural things that should be reconsidered.  My pet peeve is having to shake someone‚Äôs hand literally seconds after I just washed them.  Wash; repeat. #Idontknowwhereyourhandshavebeen.
2160,"That's an easy one to implement. Give 'em the carrot and the stick:

* Increase cleaning of airport sink areas by 400%. Focus on removing that permanent swamp puddle that engulfs the sink area.
* Put a sticky, water-soluble film all over every boarding pass, that feels super gross."
2161,Who. WHO doesn‚Äôt wash their hands after using the loo? Who could possibly be that disgusting?
2162,"I can‚Äôt believe how often this has to be emphasized. Especially in schools. No where is clean. Schools are filled with germs of grubby elementary, middle, and high school students who don‚Äôt wash after flushing and stick their hands in their pants."
2163,"I wonder what percent of airport bathrooms in China are stocked with soap and something to dry your hands, let alone toilet paper, at any given time. In my experience it's almost a coin flip."

2168,"Clean your phone, tablet, keyboard and mouse with isopropyl alcohol and a microfiber often too."
2169,Hand washing does not do much when you dry your hands off with air dryers which help transmit bacteria and germs.
2170,"And yet at pretty much 100% of public toilets here in Germany (and I am sure pretty much everywhere else), including of course airports, I have to touch the first thing that all the other men touch after holding their dicks or wiping their asses, is either the flush button, the tap handle, one or two bathroom doors, or, in most cases, all of them. Touchless flushing, switching on the taps, and especially door opening should be a no-brainer in public toilets. I am sick of opening doors with my elbow after I just washed my hands."

2199,Take out those ridiculous hand blowers for a start.
2200,Does benzoalkonium chloride work as a sanitizer against coronavirus?  For some reason that's what my work bought instead of alcohol-based sanitizer.
2201,Every public washroom I've been in (Male btw) about a good 1/5 people would just leave without washing their hands after using the urinals or toilet. I highly doubt enforcing this in washrooms would do much unless these disgusting clowns decides to wash their hands after using the bathroom.

2211,"More than 50% of the time I end up using a restroom, I see people touching their junk then the urinal flush handle & door handle on the way out without washing their hands. I believe that around *half* of all males do this without a drop of soap or water. *Half!*

If the coronavirus spreads globally, we're in for a rough ride."
2212,"A lot of dudes get downright offended if you tell them to wash their hands after peeing. Many of them think their penis is cleaner than their hands, and if they need to wash at all, they feel they should do it *before* peeing to keep the nasty hands germs off of their pristine penis. 

I have had this argument many times on reddit, because people seem to forget that bacteria love warm, moist environments, like the part of your body covered by underwear. 

Not to mention that washing regularly is a good idea anyway, to get all the stuff off your hands that has accumulated since you last washed them. That point is probably more relevant to this post, I suppose."
2213,We're dead in Japan.
2214,"I'm tired of my dad always going ""Germs is good for the immune system."", he doesn't always wash his hands after using the toilet. I wash my hands always after using the toilet and have generally good hygiene. Guess who got the flu last Decemeber? Not me, despite working in a store and lots of people being sick with the flu. He got the flu so bad he even got broncitis.

I also avoid directly touching the door handle when exiting a public toilet, eww. I even regularly wash my mouse and keyboard and also wipe my phone with disinfecting wipes."

I really want some China-level oppression world wide on hygiene . The number of people I see either not wash their hands, or simply wet them, pisses me off.

  


""Oh, I'm ok, I'm not dirty"" - that's not the point. Nobody knows when they have germs on them. Just be diligent. It's not OCD. Just sing the happy birthday song in your head while soaping and scrubbing, and again while rinsing. It's 20 seconds out of your day that might stop a baby getting measles.

2269,"Why are sanitizers a bad idea?

It takes less than a second to sanitize (possibly 0 seconds) while walking, while washing takes at least 30 seconds (and requires a sink) - doesn't sound like a lot, but hospital workers are expected to sanitize dozens of times per day."

2284,Hmmm. Seems counterintuitive but science...
2285,So I hear.
2286,Why I think...just yesterday I read that the future is reported to be even more futuristic than scientists initially reported it to be!
2287,I see people at work daily just rinsing the tip of their fingers and then grabbing half a dozen paper towels... seriously infuriates me to no end.
2288,"I'd be interested to see what the stats are on the relatively benefits of quick rinses with water, vs. quick rinses with soap, vs. 'proper' washing. I'm sure the recomedation of 15-20 seconds with soap from this article is good, I'm just curious how much is lost for less time. I would naively assume that a quick rinse still would give significant benefits over no hand washing at all."
2289,"Soap is ok and helps, but its the manual friction of rubbing your hands together that does the majority of work."
2290,"Oh, it's true. I keep a serviette in my wallet in case I end up using a restroom with a handle I have to pull, straight after washing my hands. 

I wish more places had two-way (push or pull) bathroom doors or perhaps a lip you could pull with your foot. Heck, even just a paper towel dispenser and a trash bin by the door would work. Anything so I don't have to effectively touch the penis of every man who used the bathroom before me. Ugh."
2291,"I would have to see some kind of study to believe that. Maybe a comparison of hand cultures vs penis cultures. 

I just know that penises are a lot closer to buttholes than hands, and bacteria can spread quickly in that environment. Also, I would bet that guys who don't wash their hands also do not clean their penises well."
2292,What? Why? Why isn‚Äôt hand washing a thing but taking shoes off indoors is?
2293,"Yeah both guys I live with are nurses and have said the same thing. They are typical dudes and won‚Äôt wash their hands a lot of times after pissing; BUT, when on shift they wash their hands regularly even if not using the restroom."

2300,You can tell if someone runs the water after flushing.
2301,So... UnlivedPhalanx has to go into the women's room and count how many of the women wash their hands too? For science?

2304,"Interesting. Thank you!

Also... disgusting. C Diff is nasty, and now I am wondering why all hospital toilets don't have lids."
2305,That‚Äôs a waste of everything.
2306,"A very good overview was put out in (I think) 2012 about various methods of hand washing in public. I'm not having luck right now maybe someone can chime in. Soap was disregarded as so few people used it long enough to matter in the various experiments. The bread and butter was people need to completely dry their hands after any level of rinse. So possibly it is the friction in the act of drying, but I don't recall how long hands being scrubbed underneath water having impact."
2307,Are you niles crane?
2308,"If someone bites you, you'll definitely die if you don't take an antibiotic shot. If ""the close proximity to the anus mattered"", you'd see guys having urinary tract infections all the time, like it happens to women.

2315,which in itself is unscientific.
2316,"The point isn't washing hand after using the toilet, it's increasing people washing their hands in general, before eating, after holding onto dirty escalator handrails that everybody has been touching, after resting your hands on armrests that are not thoroughly cleaned, before or after going through security, etc.

The bathrooms in a lot of airports are full just of people trying to pee (and then wash their hands afterwards). There isn't space for a whole load of other people trying to come in to wash their hands to improve basic cleanliness and help avoid spreading germs.

This should be fixed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: From the article   "" only about 20 percent of people in airports have clean hands ‚Äî meaning that they have been washed with soap and water, for at least 15 seconds, within the last hour or so. The other 80 percent are potentially contaminating everything they touch with whatever germs they may be carrying, Nicolaides says.  (...)  Improving handwashing at all of the world‚Äôs airports to triple that rate, so that 60 percent of travelers to have clean hands at any given time, would have the greatest impact, potentially slowing global disease spread by almost 70 percent""  


The focus is clearly on general handwashing, not just handwashing after using the facilities."
2317,Only when it comes to bathroom hands.
2318,All it takes is 10% for the Pareto principle to take place
2319,"Yes but some of you don't, 4 out of the 10 times I overheard my mom (nurse) ranting on the telephone it was because of people not washing their hands"
2320,"I work in a hospital, and every major hospital has data on microbe resistence patterns. We've seen lots of antibiotic- and antifungal-resistence (we in particular don't hand out enough antivirals, but antiviral-resistance is well-documented in certain organisms, e.g. HIV), but I've never heard of resistance to alcohol-based hand sanitizers. That said, hand sanitizer isn't effective against every type of virus and bacteria in the first place, so hand-washing is the gold standard to me."
2321,I think this is just going to make people not touch the handrails.
2322,"Of course it's non-scientific. It's anecdotal. Which isn't a dirty word like people think it is. Anecdotal just means testimonial claims about empirical observations (where empirical means sensory. Ie, I saw x, I heard x, I smelled x, etc). And we don't need scientific hogwash for literally everything in life when sometimes anecdotal *is more than good enough*.

For example, my own anecdotal ""observations"" indicate a similar disgusting trend: there are too many men who don't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom. I'm going to trust those observations over an above your complete lack of scientific rebuttal. Ie, posting a scientific paper that might contradict what either unlivedphalanx or myself have *directly observed with our own senses*, and then trying to convince unlivedphalanx and I that we should trust a random scientific paper (that could be talking about a location that provides outlier data) over-and-above our direct observations of the local people in our direct lives.

There are some things science is great for. For immediate and simple things in life, direct empirical observation is itself great.

EDIT: To make a really extreme point about what I'm talking about, and why Scientism is bad/stupid, I don't need a scientific paper to tell me what the price of gasoline is today. I can go look at the price myself."

2343,"Your conclusion is correct but it's not just rich profit-seekers who are the problem.

Very few people in western countries would actually be willing to pay the cost it would take to reduce O&G demand significantly now. The people of China believe the west got to enjoy cheap energy for a century before them so they should be allowed to catch up. Japan doesn't want to be reliant on China given their history as that might compromise Japan's sovereignty yet nuclear proved too unsafe. Africans feel as though the west is rich so they should pay the cost to shift to net 0 GHG Emissions not themselves. The people out west feel as though it was their parents or rich business owners who truly benefited from GHG Emitting energy not themselves as they are burdened with education debt and are among the poorest generation to have lived in the last century relative to their immediate previous generation.

Trying to blame this on some evil billionaire misses the complexity of the issue but your conclusion is right. Invent something better and more profitable than O&G and all of a sudden all the complexities become quite simple. Everyone will develop the better technology."
2344,"You don‚Äôt have to be a drinker for your brain to be affected by alcoholism.

A new study shows that just having a parent with an alcohol use disorder affects how your brain transitions between active and resting states ‚Äì regardless of your own drinking habits.

The study, performed by researchers at Purdue University and the Indiana University School of Medicine, discovered that the brain reconfigures itself between completing a mentally demanding task and resting.

But for the brain of someone with a family history of an alcohol use disorder, this reconfiguration doesn‚Äôt happen.

While the missing transition doesn‚Äôt seem to affect how well a person performs the mentally demanding task itself, it might be related to larger scale brain functions that give rise to behaviors associated with addiction. In particular, study subjects without this brain process demonstrated greater impatience in waiting for rewards, a behavior associated with addiction.

Findings are published in the journal NeuroImage. The work was led by Enrico Amico, a former Purdue postdoctoral researcher who is now a researcher at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.

How the brain reconfigures between active and resting states is like how a computer closes down a program after you‚Äôre finished with it.

If we‚Äôre wondering if this epidemic is more dangerous than other diseases and we‚Äôre basing it on deaths, then we should consider *death rates* and not death counts per se. As the transmissibility increases so too does number of cases and naturally more death counts to arise. 

Other diseases kill more people each year in each country more so than this epidemic. The flu alone kills 10000+ people in the US EACH YEAR.

Panic and disorder leads to spreading the disease. Think about it. You don‚Äôt have the flu but you are anxious and fear that you do have the flu. You decide to take a trip to the hospital instead of taking OTC. Hospital actually has flu patients. You come now you get it.

After reading Linus Pauling (2 times Nobel winner) and some fringe doctors like Kenner and Cathcart, I'm more than convinced that very high doses of Vitamin C may help preventing the spread of a viral infection in the body.

Just test it for yourself: if you have some infections, load vitamin C with 1-4g every hour up to bowel tolerance, which increases dramatically. A healthy man could have soft stools after 2 grams only, which is the maximum daily amount for most agencies. You can take dozen times that without problems if you're sick.

Nipah also starts as a flue but will have a rapid transition to seizures and comma in a few hours.  and also as you would have guessed there is no vaccine or cure and it is also transmitted by air.

Bats live in what could be considered a state of perpetual fever, as the act of flying overheats their bodies. This has led to an evolutionary arms-race between Bats and their diseases, thus, any pathogen which infects Bats is sure to be resistant to high body temperatures

The viral sequences, most researchers say, also knock down the idea the pathogen came from a virology institute in Wuhan.""

2558,"Heat starts to kill most living things pretty quickly by denaturing proteins. The shape of a protein is essential to its function, and even relatively modest changes can make them less effective or ineffective. There are thermophilic simple organisms, but the more heat resistant an organism, generally the less effective it is at lower temperatures.

&#x200B;

As is, very high fevers are more or less a sudden death round that either kill a human host or the invading organisms."
2559,"Not really: Anything above zero is no problem for a virus (it can survive intact, and simply wait for warmer conditions) , and anything above about 39 starts to become problematic, becoming more and more adverse as the temperature rises above that, until about 121 degrees, at which temperature pretty much no virus can survive.

If you're used to imperial units, use the following reference:

 * 0 degrees = freezing point of water
 * 37.5 degrees = human body temperature
 * 100 degrees = boiling point of water"
2560,"While some viruses *do* mind such tiny changes, since all it takes is one keystone protein misfolding to break the lifecycle of the Virus, (Rabies being the prime example), there's so many Viruses that it's impossible to generalize

It's important to note that strict parasites such as Viruses rely on their host to spread, thus, they will naturally adapt to their host's optimal living conditions, in our case being ~36-37 ¬∫C (98-100 ¬∫F).

Remember also that killing the host is not a good way for a parasite to survive, parasites have not evolved to kill their hosts, they have evolved to spread, and they spread better by not being noticed. 

Our fever is the ""Alarm"" that sounds during a robbery. Our body does not properly work and our immune system is actively developing antibodies to fight back. Any Virus that adapts and survives in those conditions is headed to exctinction, as all it's hosts eventually die/are outcompeted by healthy individuals, and the Virus dies with them"

Nope. We are at the stage where human genetic engineering is not only possible but trivial. My own research lab could trivially perform on a human embryo what is regularly done hundreds of times a year on mouse embryos. Trust me, the only thing that is holding this back is politics and ethics. Technologically, we have been there since about 2007.

Also, eugenics never was about breeding, it was always about introduction of desirable inherited characteristics. Just that breeding was the only way to make it happen back in the day when the concept of eugenics originated. Saying Eugenics was about breeding is like saying telephone calls were about cables.

Simply for the fact of one figuring that a baby born into a Catholic upbringing has a very good chance of being a Catholic follower, that in turn with these particular beliefs would then create more members of the same belief, in turn more money into the church....

I just read the other day that the Mormon church just surpassed the 100 billion dollar amount in wealth.....another Church that promotes a bit of parallel teaching as far as contraceptives and such. Sadly it seems that money and power have also gotten into the religious values."

For a counter example look at what happened to the quota system in the Soviet Union. When low usage of resources was rewarded with less allocated resources ‚Äú businesses ‚Äú were incentivized to use more to receive more.

That‚Äôs not to say capitalism is without its faults though, look at healthcare, insurance etc.."
2645,Easy with the rational thought there buddy.  That's dangerous talk round these here parts.
2646,"Are you saying that you could repair autism, provide tetrachromy, change eye colour, produce undamaged human clones and more? Or are you talking about minor procedures?  

It seems to me that we don't even understand the genome properly yet (mapping =/= understanding). We've only just started studying how the interaction between mRNA and DNA effects expression. 

Btw - I would be interested in hearing what we can do."
2647,"The eradication of downs syndrome in Iceland by selective abortion is textbook eugenics, but how often do you see protests against it?"
2648,I don't understand. I'm agreeing with the person that I replied to. Eugenics didn't have to be applied the way that it was. It seems the person I replied to gave an example.
2649,I was only kidding. But fr mortality rate isn‚Äôt relevant because as the user above you stated the population increase rate has been decreasing steadily for a century.
2650,Exactly. Something else developed in China no doubt
2651,Bats eat tons of mosquitos. Mosquitos carry tons of disease.
2652,"Autism is a multiple spectrum disorder. We don't know what goes wrong in autism so since we dont know what to fix, we can't fix it yet.

Provide tetrachomacy - Yes.

Change eye-color  - Yes (level of difficulty differs depending on genetic background and desired color)

Undamaged human clones - Yes (already done illegally at least once in China/S.Korea)

But still, most of the things you mentioned are fairly cosmetic. I don't know what you call a minor procedure. It's actually the same procedure whether you want to do something small or something major.

Things that people have seriously explored possibilities of in humans:

1. Somatotropin overexpression to obtain 3-4 x higher muscular strength. You want to get the required DNA to do anything with hormones? Here you go [https://www.scbt.com/browse/Growth-Hormone-CRISPR-Plasmids/\_/N-yrb65v](https://www.scbt.com/browse/Growth-Hormone-CRISPR-Plasmids/_/N-yrb65v) . Buy the kit for about 2500 $.
2. Replace dystrophin for DMD - same process
3. Replace AD, Wilson's disease for the liver etc.

I am getting bored here writing a list so let me put it this way -  there are at least about 10,000 SNP based pathologies and characteristics in humans. ALL of these are modifiable as of today.

The caveat ? Human embryos and their gestation needs to be arranged. Also, you will lose a few of the embryos (for mice, you start with 5 and expect about 2 to complete term, but no one cares because mice have litters of upto 10 at once. As long as you get 1 male and  1 female with your modifications, you are happy because you can then just conventionally breed the modified strain).

&#x200B;

The thing is in its ""infancy"" only for its widespread use due to purely social, political, ethical reasons. It is not in its infancy technologically or economically.

A good analogy is space travel and orbital tourism - no widespread use due to significant economic and logistic requirements. Not because we don't know how to put people in orbit."

> Papon was also in charge of the Paris police during the February 1962 massacre at the Charonne metro station, which took place during an anti-Organisation arm√©e secr√®te (OAS) demonstration that had been organised by the French Communist Party (PCF). 

> Forced to resign in 1967 after the suspicious forced disappearance of the Moroccan Marxist Mehdi Ben Barka, he was supported by de Gaulle in being named as president of Sud Aviation company, which co-created the Concorde plane.

Interesting fact about the Organisation Arm√©e Secr√®te. Until the Bataclan massacre the OAS was responsible for the [1961 Vitry-Le-Fran√ßois train bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Vitry-Le-Fran%C3%A7ois_train_bombing) the worst terrorist attack on French soil ever until the Bataclan massacre and which was completely censored by the French state because it was carried out by elements of the French military."

87,"_Generally_, when you spent time, money, or effort on a problem, you reduce the amount of time, money, or effort left to actually solve the problem.

I say, ""I will spent $20 and 30 minutes to finish this steak"", then I pay for it (or commit to paying for it) and spend 15 minutes eating it.  Now I only need to expend 15 more minutes, and no more money, to achieve my original goal. 

Of course, it frequently happens that I gain more information, either about the total cost of the solution or its value, as I am working on it (like ""this steak isn't that good"") or my goal shifts (I am naturally not as hungry as I was).

The sunk-cost fallacy only comes into play when I disregard those changes and focus only my original estimates and my expenditures against those estimates."

A couple months later the same thing happens and you pay even more money, eventually a problem comes up that's more expensive then it would be to get a new car so you end up buying a new car and you've now lost at least $800 instead of $300 because of the sunk cost you put in. When making a decision you shouldn't let previous costs related to that choice play a factor into your choice because the money is already gone you're not going to get any back from throwing more money at the problem. With your food once you've bought it, it doesn't really matter where it goes from a financial stand point, you're not going to gain anything by overeating so why make yourself uncomfortable?"

164,"Since a lot of people don't get this, here's some extra info..

The point is that it's not a rule, it's a decision the riders made between them to make racing outcomes more tactic/strength based. No one wants to win or loose a 3 week race because of equipment failure.

What you have to realise is that with so many teams; different classifications to race for; and different daily race profiles, you need to have allies on other teams sometimes. For example, to help in a breakaway or to ride down a breakaway, or sometimes even to get spare equipment. You won't get this if you ride like an inconsiderate, selfish asshole."

Home field is usually an advantage enough but to let them have the lead in the hometown would have to have an effect on the outcome.

201,Makes sense. Letting a guy move 20 meters up to lead the race is a little different than everyone stopping for several minutes.

205,"Cycling is pretty much top of the game for doping control. The reason you hear about it, is precisely because they‚Äôre doing something about it."
206,"They do, you just can't pedal when you do it. You need a nice long shallow gradient and a nice stretchy pair of bib-shorts."
207,You don't win from crossing the finish line at the end. All your times get averaged out at each stage. IIRC it's 21 stages and usually takes 23 days to finish. It's not a non stop race.
208,"You're clueless and shouldn't comment. Steroids are not a problem in cycling. Doping is and while not impossible, it is extremely difficult to get away with it under today's rules.

A cyclist will get suspended for having no drugs in their system and a high red cell blood count. They do this by extracting their very healthy / rich blood during the off-season and then during a major tour they'll do a blood transfusion to increase their red cell blood count that has been reduced over days / weeks of racing.

Do some research before commenting next time, makes you look ignorant if you don't."
209,Steroids are really not that beneficial for cycling. The actual effective drugs are the ones that boost hematocrit.
210,The winner of the classification is the rider with the most points at the end of the Tour. Not just who teaches the goal first
211,i would feel the need to rent a porto potty and have them at certain places only i could use.
212,Number two!
213,I can only shit at priceless moments!
214,"Yeah, and the article says the hometown hero only gets to be in the front of the peloton (the main group riding together), not the front of the whole race. So if there's a few riders who pulled out ahead of the pack it's not like they need to come back and give the guy the lead. It wouldn't actually affect the standing much since everyone in the peloton is essentially on the same pace anyway for that stage."
215,Integrity is not a term often used when writing about the Tour de France. üòï
216,"That's not really integrity...I dunno what it is but it's silly.... Crashes and mechanical issues affect everyone.. why slow down just because it's #1? They don't do the for anyone else?   Is it a race, or a parade ? ( yes I know about the final stage)"
217,Randy Marsh approves of all forms of tegridy.
218,"But also hgh, epo, roids and blood doping."
219,"Integrity? This doesn't seem like integrity, it just seems lame. To me the appeal of sports is people doing everything they can to win. It's competition in a relatively consequence free (compared to, say, war) arena. Stuff like this just makes me roll my eyes and wonder why a ""rule"" breaker hasn't taken advantage of it yet for a marginal gain. If you aren't trying to optimize your performance why are you competing?"
220,Integrity and cycling. Lol
221,"Too bad stuff like this turns it into Entertainment, not sport.

I dont give a shit about your personal honor, perform."
222,I‚Äôve as many TDF titles as Lance Armstrong. True fact.
223,Means this person is the leader.
224,The first Tour de France was a one off race that was originally sponsored by a magazine which had a yellow cover. It was a kind of advertising for them. The tradition has carried on for the race leader.
225,"Its an unwritten rule so you could take advantage if u really wanted

The motive behind this though is that winning because the leader had an equipment malfunction or something isnt the same as winning because you are the faster rider."
226,It's a good way to defend an attack.
227,"now, peeing into a drysuit, that is another chapter entirely..."
228,"The hometown thing is a non-issue. It‚Äôs just someone coming to the front of the pack for a few minutes. Pro cycling team riders all have assigned tasks - once out of a given rider‚Äôs hometown, they‚Äôll resume their duties. They‚Äôre not going to be busting ass ahead of the pack - and if you follow pro cycling at all, you‚Äôll know breakaways get caught more often than not."
229,As in any top level sport
230,The modern pace was dictated by the cheating/doping. So if that could be irradiated then you would be at a normal pace.
231,Armstrong got away with it over 7 years. Just saying.
232,Ah that makes sense alright
233,Or a teammate to push you along. Being a domestique is no joke.
234,Or a teammate to push you along. Being a domestique is no joke.
235,Because it‚Äôs logistically impossible to try to maintain a three week race. They have to sleep and eat and shower.
236,"everyone in the Peloton gets the same ""time"" as the first guy in the Peloton.  This is to prevent a massive sprint in sight of the goal with 30+ bicyclists, it would just always end in a crash.

So yea they just let him be in the front."
237,"There are unwritten rules, for example, doping is part of the sport, but putting an electric motor in your bike is verboten."
238,"What‚Äôs interesting is that the omert√† around doping in the Tour actually is about some kind of integrity: but integrity to the athletes because it was considered impossible to get through the race without help. But I get what you‚Äôre saying, for sure."
239,"Here we go, another redditor who doesn't own a bike is going to tell everyone how horrible a sport, he's never participated on level in, is."
240,"Actually, if you're in the back and have bike issues, they will just take away the time you spent disabled.  The whole sport is rather odd. It is not like a normal race at all"
241,"How I see it; if that person is currently the best cyclist in the race(we don't know the new best racer until the end of the race) and it you and him, neck and neck, then through a one in a million chance he his chain fails. Then you win, but can you really say you were the better racer?

Maybe you can, but that's not the whole story. Imagine you are the champion, you're beating the second place guy by a fair few meters. Then it is your chain that fails, and you lose to that second place man. Is he really the better racer?

Fundamentally, the competition is between who is the better racer not who has a better luck."
242,"It's not always true, it depends on the context. If the race is heated then they won't wait for him nor anyone else. I'd say the race shouldn't become heated because of the incident. It's like a moral thing."
243,"To be clear, the unwritten rule is that it's ot cool to attack after someone has a mechanical. However if rivals are already fighting each other then a mechanical at that point is fair game. The riders do not want to win on a technicality, they want to show they are the strongest rider(team)."
244,"It applies to every team leader. So Froome, Banal, Duomolin, those type of guys, will not be able to crash out of a race. However, the supporting riders usually does not get that treat.

Note: This does not apply to situations where the race is going on. So if you crash when there's a sidewind on flat road (which is a situation where teams always push the pace) or you get a mechanical when a leader is attacking, though luck. For an example of how these unwritten rules interact, see stage 12 of the 2016 Tour de France, [covered at the 2:20 mark of this video ](https://youtu.be/ZP_Qo4qN97k)"
245,It's a mix of both. I can't decide if I like that or not.
246,"You win the race with your legs, not when the leader‚Äôs bike breaks. If you attack and force the leader into a crash or a mechanical problem, that‚Äôs fair game though."
247,It's not entertaining to lose out on good racing because the strongest man got a flat tire. You don't know what you're talking about.
248,why isn't the person in front called the leader?
249,"But if you had an equipment malfunction in 2nd place, fuck off?

or had an equipment malfunction in the previous race to make you not the leader?"
250,"But you were the faster rider, that day."
251,"But you were the faster rider, that day."
252,"So to be clear, if we expose the doping measures to radiation, the riders will agree to a normal pace, where normal is defined as a pace that is not modern. Got it."
253,Didn‚Äôt the other 200 or so people below him as well?
254,"Yeah, and cycling actually has strong controls. The other sports simply don't give a shit because it's more profitable to let them juice."
255,"The American team started doping when they realized the europeans doped as a matter of course. 

I think the idea that ""Lance Armsrtrong doped!"" is a bit specious. 

I also think it's amazing how like practically everyone in the US became an expert on men's professional cycling overnight when the scandal broke. It was really something to behold."
256,And holding on to water bottles coming out of your support car so you don't have to peddle is fine
257,"I feel they should just making doping an official part of the sport. It's ridiculous that riders can take advantage of advancements in material sciences like carbon fiber bikes, aero helmets and advancements in nutrition but aren't allowed to use bio chemistry? 

Why not? Professional cycling is already insanely dangerous so if you're willing to go the extra step and play with your body chemistry more power to you."
258,"> impossible to get through the race without help

Slower but not impossible."
259,"It's not really who is the best, it's who has the best race. That's why it's so fun. And really, it's which team has the best race."
260,"You have a point, but isn't equipment part of the story? Isn't part of being a good bicyclist maintaining your bike? Also avoiding potholes and other racers, all the things that can cause issues? Isn't it more than pedaling the fastest? If you were carrying the vital information √† la 1917 and your bike broke down, thousands could die. ""For want of a nail ...the war was lost."""
261,"Well it could be who slept better, so should you not race until you both had a good night sleep? Or what if one of you had a bad dream etc. There are a million things that impact the outcome, It's tough to say if both are ever actually at 100%. Going on a long enough race you imagine the random variants should be somewhat accounted for just by the distance."
262,"But mechanical issues are the crew's part of the race. The crew let you down, so you lose."
263,"When someone's car breaks down in an auto race, it's generally accepted that the equipment is part of the racer."
264,"Breakdowns affect everyone, except the leader?   Is this also common in The Giro and other big races?"
265,"Morals in the Tour de France? Ha, ha, ha! You're kidding right?

How's the drug testing going?"
266,Part of competition is luck.
267,The race takes more than two weeks. They are not on their bikes 24/7 and you need to be able to tell who made the best progress over several stages.
268,Because it's a multi day race and your time is cumulative over all the days. So the person in front on any given day might not be the one actually leading the overall time.
269,"They will do the same. The reality is there are probably fewer than 5 riders that could win the race on an average year and normally 2 or 3   realistically. It's a race between them. 

The daily races can be won by anyone."
270,The race lasts a month. It's the overall leader you don't pass on a mechanical failure. If you want to win today's race you can go as fast as you want.
271,The riders won‚Äôt have to agree to anything. You said yourself that without doping they can‚Äôt perform the modern pace. Take out the doping and the normal pace will be whatever their normal bodies allow.
272,Yeah that‚Äôs my point
273,"In tennis for example you can just hide in your panic room to avoid random testing.

No sport has strong controls. Some are just stronger than others."
274,"*pedal

Peddle means to sell or try to sell/promote a product."
275,Is that a thing?
276,I've been saying it for years: just make leagues for sports where that kind of stuff is *mandatory*.
277,Just getting the point across. Was a competitive cyclist for 15 years.
278,"> It's not really who is the best, it's who has the best pharmacist. That's why it's so fun. And really, it's which team has the best pharmacist.

FTFY"
279,They have dedicated team mechanics but shit still happens.
280,Or who can afford the best bike chain? Team? Dope?
281,"I believed Lance for far too long... Now I just think old heroes beat the tests and new ones have better ways to avoid detection.
Unfortunately"
282,"Oh please, people need to shut the fuck up about doping. Every sport has doping if money is involved. Get off your high horse."
283,"i dont get it, so its not whoever gets to X first, wins?"
284,"Do you know what doping is? It's very hard to catch, is not necessarily related to drug use, and cycling has put in a number of controls to prevent it. You have to test almost everyday to catch it because an athlete can have a red blood cell count consistent for days and then a sudden spike, no drugs in their system. What exactly would you do to improve that process besides point out that it is a problem?"
285,Right and that's part of the excitement of the race. You eat and train correctly before the race but you could still pull a muscle during the race. Shit happens. Why stop the race when shit happens?
286,There are rules on the bikes and they can't be lighter than they already are for example so you don't need a 5 million dollar bike to win.
287,"I don't hold it against Lance very much. It's not like the guys he was competing against weren't also doping.  The guys who won before him most certainly were doping, they just didn't get caught because testing wasn't sophisticated."
288,found lance's dealer
289,"It's a perfectly normal response to a comment staying that the race has a ""morality"" component."
290,That would be true for an individual stage but the person who wins the Tour de France is the person who has the lowest cumulative time across all stages.  They basically ride 21 races in 23 days and the person with the lowest total time wins.  It's like a whole season of a car racing league in 3 weeks.
291,"The tour is divided into 21 stages. At every stage your time between start and finish is recorded. All the times are added together and the winner of the tour is the one with the lowest time.

The yellow jersey is worn by whoever has the lowest time total at the beginning of any stage (no one wears it the first day).

There's also prizes for winning individual stages."
292,"I hold it against him because he destroyed the lives of other people to support his lies. The doping i could forgive, his behaviour surrounding it was awful"
293,"A few days later, entries for ""mish mish man"" were added to the site :

294,"""ORDER IN THE COURT! I SAID ORDER! Now, I understand some of you are upset that your nizzles have been shizzled, but as I've already said if you're not crack-a-lackin', then you're going to see the broad side of my pimp hand. Now peep this..."" - some old White judge on day 3 of the trial."
295,"~~NSFW~~ fair warning for his Wikipedia page. Kurten loved drinking blood and was a sick psychopath.

Just warning people as it has graphic descriptions of corpse mutilation and murder."
296,"There is some anecdotal evidence that a decapitated person may have several seconds of awareness before death. Modern physicians believe most of these anecdotes are just a case of reflexive muscle twitching and you might get 2-3 seconds *at most* before losing consciousness. I don't know how loud blood gushing is or how much ambient noise/head falling sound could cover it up. Plus when you're rapidly losing consciousness, your awareness at the tail end of your seconds would be significantly diminished."
297,NSFW is a tag that people put on images/ videos that are not safe for work. Nothing about this serial killer's wikipedia page is NSFW.
298,It's for people who don't want to read graphic descriptions of a guy murdering people. Just a fair warning. :P
299,"In that case trriger warming for violence, blood, etc.

I, on the other hand, love the stories of serial killers xD"
300,"But NSFW is a tag that people use for things that are inappropriate for work so that others know the content could potentially get them in trouble.

The factual account of some crime, in text form, is not something that anyone could casually see over your shoulder, or complain is *categorically* inappropriate for work."
301,"I work for a surveillance company.

Your boss is 100% looking at what you're reading on your phone and you will be judged for it."
302,There is 100% nothing anyone's boss could say about reading the factual account of some crime that they couldn't say about any other non-work related content.
303,I didn't say the boss would say anything. But the kind of stuff they talk to us about definitely includes what you're looking at on your phone. You may not be openly chastised but you will be judged.
304,People judge other people about everything. The tag NSFW has a purpose.
305,"That's equivocation.

If someone sees you reading a wiki page about ice cream they're less likely to judge you than if you're all about them serial killers.

So yes, people do judge for everything. But they judge you differently based on the content. People would certainly judge me if I wore pink shorts to work but they would judge me differently if I had a book on my desk about Ted Bundy.

That's common sense. Or at least I thought so until your response. Feels weird having to explain it."
306,"Bro, if someone sees you looking at dick pics at work you can get fired. Dick pics are NSFW.

If some uptight person sees you looking at a wiki for a serial killer, or listening to a true crime podcast, they might judge you, but they can't file an HR complaint.

NSFW is for things about which an HR complaint could likely be filed. As such they are unsafe for work.

A person judging you doesn't make something NSFW."

Europeans: South America is hot and wet, Obviously, that makes the Inca and Maya living there are weak and shriveled savages."
312,"Isn't much of North America, especially the greatly inhabited parts, closer to the equator than Europe?

314,Did the English hold this thought? Because I've been over there and it's not exactly hot and dry. Or did they think themselves weak? (Narrator: they did not)
315,He's still a slave owning degenerate.
316,Even saying it while living in France is obnoxious.

318,"> I could've sworn New York City was south of Rome and New Orleans was on the same line of latitude as Saudi Arabia. Far from cold and moist.

NYC is roughly the same latitude as Rome, so south of Paris, London, etc., but latitude is only part of the equation when calculating climate. Outside of being hot, New Orleans is in no way similar to Riyadh - the Deep South is a humid swamp.

The theory was more about political calculus than anything else: by claiming that America was this worthless place, the monarchies of Europe were hoping to stem the flow of emigration from their countries and revolution within their countries that would follow the American Revolution, in Europe. It was in direct contrast to the concept of the 'American Dream' (all this space would allow a person to grow and flourish freely)."

>Hi Steve:

>I'm from Dallas, TX. A few years ago I had bought my ticket to see Pete Best in Oklahoma City (which is about 3 hrs driving North of Dallas); the day of the concert **I drove up there and to my surprise, there was a note on the doors of the venue saying that the concert had been cancelled**. I assumed it was because of poor sales... This year, I was excited that Pete Best is now on tour and that he had scheduled a show in Dallas, TX (May 10th)! So, I got my ticket and was ready for the concert and today I got an email from the people from the Granada Theater saying that the show is being cancelled! Not again!! For the 2nd time! This is the text from the email I got:

>>""We are very sorry to have to inform you that **Pete Best has cancelled his May 10, 2006 performance at the Granada Theater**. It's always hard for us to accept, to all the fans we're very sorry, our anticipation of this special concert was very high as well. Very recent changes in laws with passports caused the cancellation and they are working to get a date re-scheduled at Granada as soon as the passports are up to date. You will be receiving a refund on your credit card for the full ticket price. We will be refunding all service charges as well. We are working with the agent to reschedule as soon as possible, however no date is set as of yet. Thank you for understanding, we appreciate your support of the Granada.

>I hope they do reschedule the show! Ben Zavala

354,I think the feud was between Perkins and Elvis.
355,Everyone knows Johnny Ryall really wrote it.
356,"Same.

Sadly it would have to be Guns and Roses and only need to to play the first 10 chords from sweet child of mine.

Or Oasis and just needed for Wonderwall."
357,Easy. Go to concert. Wait for guitar player to be killed. Step up.
358,"I think that's a dream of many fans. 

It could quickly become a nightmare if you fuck up, however..."
359,"Walk Hard. 

HARD!"
360,"I believe in you Dewey, I just know you're going to fail!"
361,Yes.
362,This story is better if it was two different people.
363,Titlegore for sure.
364,"dang it, I was just about to make this joke, too. ""So who was the audience member?"""
365,"It‚Äôs not on Cash. Band gets x rate for touring and performing and since that takes a majority of their time, there isn‚Äôt likely to be another revenue stream. This is why bands fight hard for songwriting / publishing credits. 

I don‚Äôt know if Wootton had any songwriting credits but if he didn‚Äôt, the rate for a touring musician in the 60‚Äôs, 70‚Äôs, etc wouldn‚Äôt likely to be very high. Cash and crew weren‚Äôt playing Wembley every night and merchandising wasn‚Äôt where it is now."
366,"Also, the late Don LaFontaine - the voice of thousands of movie trailers."
367,Anyone got a bag of dice???
368,"After Luther died, cash hired a temporary replacement named Carl Perkins  (the two men are not related) he is the one that didn't show up."
369,Carl Perkins is a different musician and songwriter altogether.
370,Carl Perkins wrote and originally recorded Blue Suede Shoes that was later popularized when Elvis covered it.
371,"Probably made pretty decent money but not enough to live off of indefinitely, especially because I can't imagine he made much in royalties. That or he could have just come to enjoy life on the road."
372,Sometimes backup players only make a flat rate and don‚Äôt own any of the royalties. My friend was in a band that had a one-hit wonder top the Billboard charts. He got paid for recording sessions and $1500/week on the road plus per diem. That was the late 1990s. It‚Äôs more than enough to live on but when it stops you probably don‚Äôt have a lot of savings. He literally couldn‚Äôt get a job a McDonald‚Äôs after that because he had very little experience and a platinum record so they figured he wouldn‚Äôt be happy flipping burgers.
373,Recording band vs touring are often different so touring artists often don't make royalties
374,"Johnny Stopped touring in 97, and Bob was not part of the American recording sessions. Not sure when he drove the tour bus for the pumpkins but its not like he had a 401k (or heath insurance) or something."
375,With very little cash
376,health insurance for one I'd imagine. tour folk (crew and sidemen) get paid flat fees not salaries. unless you're lucky enough to work for a family type organization that will pay for your coverage when you're NOT on tour.
377,"> Did johnny cash not pay him enough?

Up until insta/youtube made it easier for musicians/artists to get fame/sponsorships recently, plenty of 'famous' touring musicians made fairly low money; like lower than your average college grad. Music wasn't big money unless you were huge. And even then, some got screwed by their contract. There's a famous interview from someone in the R&B group TLC in the early 90s where she said after paying taxes/management fees/etc, the groupmembers cleared ~$50k each in one of their biggest years, and they were huge..."
378,"Everyone else in the band did at one point or another.

Friends of mine were at a show of theirs in Hoboken right before Gish was released.  Want to say Maxwells, but anyways he hung out with them a bit afterwards, and helped them load up their van and James said something along the lines of ""Billy is an Asshole"" to him."
379,"(Cool guy, if he whips out that guitar and starts singing a song about his previous job experience, he's in!)"
380,He didn't miss a show. The show was cancelled! By himself.
381,"To be fair, he probably had to make last minute changes for the passports, as they mention in the email, and just couldn‚Äôt get them done before the show."

If you haven't seen it before, check out ""The Wrecking Crew"".  It's a documentary about studio musicians playing tracks for albums put out by famous bands.  Some of these guys were making $5k a week - in 1970 - and had nothing to show for it at the end (well, except for great memories I  imagine).  Excellent documentary."
408,"I think you're overestimating how much a touring musician would make, especially if they weren't getting royalties."
409,"Not if you're on the road. It's expensive, like trying to maintain two households, at the minimum."
410,"Touring musicians often don't make much money.  There are stories a plenty.  Even, if you play for a massive act, your pay does not scale all that much.  The recording artist will keep the majority of the gig profits and do enough to keep the rest of the band in fresh underwear.

If you are a founding member of a band and part of the band identity, it's a different thing than being Cash's touring guitar jock."

467,I love it cause the nickname sounds like he has a lot of good ideas ('lightbulb moments') but he really just turned lights off.
468,"Another fun fact:- The first president to install electric lighting at the White House was Benjamin Harrison in 1891, but he never touched the light switches himself, for fear of being electrocuted. This was a reasonable fear, given how crude household electric wiring could be at the time. It was the White House domestic staff that operated the light switches exclusively."

'Both are French importations of valet (the ""t"" being silent in modern French) or varlet, Old French variants of vaslet ""man's servant"", originally ""squire, young man"", assumed to be from Gallo-Romance Vulgar Latin *vassellittus ""young nobleman, squire, page"", diminutive of Medieval Latin vassallus, from vassus ""servant"", possibly cognate to an Old Celtic root wasso- ""young man, squire"" (source of Welsh gwas ""youth, servant"", Breton goaz ""servant, vassal, man"", Irish foss ""servant""). See yeoman, possibly derived from yonge man, a related term. '

517,"So the word is French and is pronounced as in French but it is wrong because reasons? Sadly, won't even be the most useless TIL I'll read today...."

526,"No, ‚Äòforte‚Äô, the noun, meaning strong point,  is the feminine form of French ‚Äòfort‚Äô.  One syllable.

558,"No, deal with reality."
559,Isnt this whole comment thread about how Beijing shouldnt have gotten HK and Macau back in the first place? They are indisputably worse off.
560,"That's not quite true. International law required the UK to give back the New Territories, not Hong Kong. I don't think the other commentator was espousing particularly conservative points: multiple ideas were considered. One being to simply keep Hong Kong, another to grant Independence. In the end it was decided that relations with China were more important and HK has, in my opinion, suffered the consequences."

566,What is chinese territory? The PRK is an illegitimate regime with no territorial rights.
567,"The right decision for the UK government, maybe. Clearly it was in your opinion. But the UK has a delightful track record of turning it's back on ex-colonies and this is a prime example. Take, for example, how quickly they created the [British National Overseas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_(Overseas)) status for Hong Kong citizens to cut down on what was feared to be a flood of migration to the UK. The British government knew they were handing over 5 million people from a relatively free and prosperous city to an authoritarian government which explicitly stated they wanted to assimilate them - this was not the same China that the UK took the islands from 99 years previously. The 50 year rule was put in to slow that process and it's debatable as to how successful that's been. Elections there only allow Communist Party members to stand, education has switched to Mandarin from the local Cantonese, and police brutality has sparked the [umbrella movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_Movement)."

586,So I last for 2 mins in my dreams as well?!
587,Always wondered that.
588,"I‚Äôm skeptical of this. Several times I‚Äôve had an external stimulus (alarm clock going off, etc.) be incorporated into my dreams, but while the dream included the stimulus for a few minutes of activity the external stimulus only started seconds before I woke up. 

Perhaps it‚Äôs variable."
589,"I've had dreams that cover years. Not every night, but regularly. 

Average is likely near real time, tho."
590,Pretty crazy some people remember how long whatever they were doing in their dream took
591,Something that I find interesting for myself is that if I think of my life over the number of years that I have lived - it seems very short.  Like I've only lived for a short while - one's memories of one's life is very compressed and you forget the mundane day-to-day stuff - so only the main things are memorable.
592,"Very often I'll wake up 15-20min after going to sleep having lived through a whole adventure in my dream. So, to me, this rings false."
593,"What has always been interesting to me is when I dream about something, I notice the realistic subtleties that I would never think of if just imagining it while awake. At least for me"
594,"The study assumes we only dream in REM sleep, which is incorrect. 

The word count correlation would exist whether or not there was a 1:1 relationship between 'dream time' and 'real time.'"
595,It's why my sex dreams only last 30 seconds.
596,No..
597,Doubt it
598,"By ""cover years"" do you actually mean you went through living life for years in your dream?  You dreamed that you woke up, peed, walked to the kitchen ate breakfast, showered, went to work, surfed the internet, had small talk, etc, etc, 365 days x however many years you covered in your dream?"
599,"dude just had them describe the dreams and compared the description word count to the length of time they were recorded dreaming.

Except this is obviously a really imprecise way to calculate correlation, and the study assumed we only dream during REM. Except, we dream during NREM as well, meaning 'recorded dreaming times' would be meaningless without something measuring brain activity."
600,"Not 24/7, but I've aged a few decades in a dream.

I have a regular one that is about two years long."

617,"Dies amabilia pagae est, et es horribilis anser."
618,"Canadian here.

Yes, Canadian geese are aggressive and will fuck you up.

There‚Äôs a reason for that: every 13 years we Canadian participate in a magic ritual where we transpose all our negative emotions into the geese. This is the reason Canada is such a friendly place.

No one is certain why geese were chosen. Rumours say that we used to alternate between species, until 1921, where Arch Hoser Magus Doug Thibault declared that geese will now forever used as the receptacle of Canadian negativity, after one took a massive shit on his favourite wizard beaver skin hat."
619,Canadian here. Have participated in magic ritual.

My wife and girlfriend are both seasoned metal heads, and they were both buried in my chest flinching every time the bass hit. This was way beyond any safe or sane level of noise."
736,"I only wear my plugs for the openers (if I don't know them well). I know people say they make it sound better, but I just don't like it. (And yes they as ""musicians"" plugs) I avoid being too close to one speaker and I don't go to very many shows, so risk of tinnitus is less."

Needless to say, he wasn't paid in full.

Also, there are 18 possible openings in chess, and 18 possible second moves, so after just one move each, there are a possible 324 positions. Then it gets really complex."

The Front of WWI was a bloody stew of human, horse and other animal body parts. In that putrid mess a virus (H1N1) was carried back home with returning soldiers. Spreading around the world infecting 500 million and killing 50 - 100 million of the very young and old. There was no cure. It just stopped. There is still no cure."

The origins of chocolate and who added what to it first are still widely disputed. This article specifically points out that Jamaicans may have even added milk and cinnamon long before Sir Hans Sloane. And we know humans have known chocolate as far back as  350 BC. 

The history of chocolate has a lot of question marks and is disputed by many historians. We know that it was brought back to Spain from the Americas in the 1500s. The French drank it with milk, sugar and vanilla. The English may have been the first to create solid chocolate bars. And the Swiss are often credited with combining the hard chocolate bar of the English, with the flavor of the French. But as you can even see in the comments of the article, all that is still hotly disputed. Nobody knows for sure."

Alcoholic beverages like beer, cider and wine of course provided a safe low alcohol source of hydration in places where clean, uncontaminated drinking water wasn't always convenient.

Teas, Herbal teas and coffee have both long been appreciated for their stimulative, calming, etc side effects.

Carbonated beverages like Coke were offered by the pharmacists shop, some with some ""active ingredients"" we no longer have in modern formulations. Dr. Pepper, of course had claims to aid in ""digestion and restores vim, vigor and vitality"".

Herbal Bitters, which are a classic foundation to many a traditional drink were patent medicines to cure what ailed you, and conveniently used alcohol as a base to carry active ingredients.

1085,"Ontario here - we (Canada) lose about 3500 every year to the flu, despite vaccinations. The flu vaccine isn't a guarantee, I'm sure some of them had been vaccinated.

1089,"I dont have a source handy, but efficacy of the flu shot varies wildly year to year, since they are basically guessing about what strains will proliferate. In a good year its about 60% effective. In a bad year its about 8%."
1090,No not too much
1091,"For those older than 50, flu shot is only 26% effective.   But for the children (2-17%)  it's  60% effective.  Those are the 2 populations who have flu complications, leading to death.

He was so ripped he thought little elves were attacking him which is why he bolted from his hotel shower in the first place .

1159,It‚Äôs super bizarre but I love it. I remember reading that the guy that wrote the book that it‚Äôs based on hated it. But Aykroyd is so off the wall and Belushi being the straight man is just hilarious to me. There‚Äôs some really funny scenes in it.

A room could be worth $100k in assets and furnishings, but to replace those assets and furnishings would cost $100k + labor and other expenses needed to refurnish and replace the room. Labor isn't cheap, neither are the resources needed to dispose of the trash and broken furnishings. Include paint and/or wallpaper to replace the damages to the wall, any maintenance required to repair damaged vents, smoke detectors, etc. and the costs start to pile up way, way more than just the $100k value of the room itself."

1214,In same video someone did worse. They had a whole floor...
1215,"Even if the assets were 500k, in order to get to $1mill total ($500k labor), that's 2500 man-hours at a robust $200 an hour.  Hard to imagine $500k in labor.  You could build a 2000sf home from scratch in less man-hours"

1220,"Also that you can't sell any of the other high-roller suites next to that room while the loud repair work is being carried out.

e.g. if a room worth $100,000 in fixtures and fittings is rented out for a nightly rate of $5,000 (low estimate for such a room) and the whole room needs replacing, then it costs the $100k + (X times nightly rate divided by occupancy) + labor for X days + X times nightly rate over occupancy for any rooms within earshot.

Decluttered version of this Slate Magazine's article archived on November 18, 2015 can be viewed on https://outline.com/x6uRPP"
1263,"There was a segment on ""superforecasters"" on NPR about ten days ago."
1264,Interesting
1265,Yes! Revisions and ability to respond to new data & not be anchored. I work in financial research and this is typically a key fault of analysts.
1266,"> Tetlock says superforecasters share some qualities, like being actively open-minded, seeking new data, updating one‚Äôs opinion when new data requires it, and seeking out reliable expert advice to inform one‚Äôs own opinions.

so i am a superforecaster. nice. the term i use is ""extraploration"". see the actual state if something; get to know, what the past was; imagine, how the change happened; extrapolate the likely future outcome. until two years ago, i could not understand, that others can't do it like me.

i. e. when Trump announced to run for President, i knew, that he would win, no matter who would run against him. it was about media appearances all the time. now, it is about hope. Buttigieg is the only one to win over Trump; if Warren or Biden become his opponent, they will lose. Bernie is a nice old man without any chance.

yet, reddit is a filterbubble, strange enough to think, that Trump supporters are a minority, so there is no useful discussion possible in /r/politics, so they will continue to rant, and to tell people to ""register to vote"", and believe, that their engagement within reddit does matter.

with more superforecasters, life would be easier.

* the U.S. embassy had reliable information that placed blame on rank-and-file PKI members

2.- He hates freedom, literally, I know the ""they hate us for our freedoms"" sounds like such a meme, but they really did, Bin Laden literally wrote in his letter that one of the reasons for 9/11 was that western women are ""whores who show too much skin"", ""you drink alcohol"" and ""Las Vegas is too sinful n sheit"".

3.- He was angry at US presence in the middle east that wasn't even hostile, he hated US bases in SA that are there with permission of SA and Kuwait, basically he probably hated the ""presence of kaffir too close to Mecca"".

4.- He was angry at US sanctions against Iraq, sanctions that were in place because Saddam Hussein was an arab Hitler, this is the man who commited genocide with chemical weapons, razed entire villages to the ground and murdered everybody who opposed him, but yeah, I guess sanctions are a worse evil!

Those are the fucking literal reasons you can read in his letter, it's beyond pathetic ""their reasoning was just like yours"" yeah, sure, if you are such a moral relativist then stop acting like I'm in the wrong since you don't believe anybody can be wrong and all pespectives are relative."

I remember when [someone claiming to be the daughter of Loraine Allison on *Titanic*-related message boards yelling at anyone who didn't believe her](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/community/threads/helen-loraine-allison-kramer-survivor-titanic-mystery.8524/page-3).

Then a DNA test came back negative.

Then she shut up and vanished.

1476,"The trouble wasn't room, it was buoyancy. She was wearing a life vest, so she wasn't going to drown. She got up on the door to stay out of the freezing water, and thus delay a death from hypothermia. When he tried to climb on, the door flipped - which means that, with both of them on it, it would've been partially submerged. So they both would've been semi-submerged in freezing water, and both of them would've frozen to death before the other boat came back. (From real life, we know that most people who were in the water with life jackets died in under twenty minutes, while the one boat that came back to rescue people took longer than that to organize itself.)

She should, however, have stayed on the lifeboat that Jack PUT HER INTO half an hour earlier. She would've lived, and he could've used the door by himself."

1479,"Whoops. Here you go.

> It has been described as the Titanic‚Äôs last mystery and involves one of the most tragic of all tales connected to the sinking.

> Loraine Allison, then aged two, had been travelling on the liner with her family when it sank.

> Initial reports said that she had died, along with her parents, but no body was ever found.

> In the years that followed, though, a sensational twist saw a woman, Helen Kramer, come forward claiming to be the child, and apparently able to provide details thought to be known only to the family.

> She mounted a long campaign to be accepted by surviving members of the wealthy Allison family, in the face of their strong opposition.

> That claim has been sustained, after her death, by Kramer‚Äôs own descendants, in an increasingly bitter dispute, which has seen restraining orders taken out, accusations of harassment made, and even security patrols set up to stop a family burial plot being interfered with.

> Now, however, more than a century after the sinking, the mystery has been solved, following the culmination of the Loraine Allison Identification Project, which was established by a group of Titanicologists, as aficionados of the doomed liner are known.

> The group arranged for DNA testing of both the descendants of Kramer and from the family who had died on the ship, which revealed no genetic link, exposing the decades-old claim as a hoax.

> The ruling meant Loraine kept the unhappy claim of being the only child from first of second class to die in the sinking.

> She had been travelling with her parents, Hudson and Bess, and seven-month old brother Trevor.

> Her father was a Canadian entrepreneur and the family travelled with an extensive entourage of servants. When the ship struck the iceberg, Trevor was taken onto a lifeboat by a maid, Alice Cleaver.

> Hudson, Bess and Loraine remained on board, apparently giving up many opportunities to be saved, possibly because they were searching for their son.

> Some reports state Bess and Loraine were placed in a lifeboat, but that they returned to the ship, either because Bess would not leave her husband, or because she was distraught, not knowing that her son was safe.

> The three were supposedly last seen huddled together on the boat deck, near the officers‚Äô quarters, as others were struggling nearby to free the last of the collapsible lifeboats for use. Only Hudson‚Äôs body was recovered. The family featured in Julian Fellowes 2012 drama, Titanic, as well as an earlier US television series, made in 1996.

> It was not until 1940 that Helen Kramer, styling herself Loraine Kramer made her claim to be the missing child. She appeared on a radio show called ‚ÄúWe, the people‚Äù, and said she had been saved at the last moment when Hudson placed her in a lifeboat with a man who brought her up as his own.

> Helen Kramer

> This ‚ÄúMr. Hyde‚Äù had raised her as his own in England, where she said she attended boarding school, before moving to the US. She said Mr Hyde had revealed the truth to her after she requested her birth certificate and shortly before his death.

> Kramer said he had also disclosed his real identity: Thomas Andrews, who had been Titanic‚Äôs designer and builder and who was thought to have died in the sinking.

> Despite the apparently far fetched claims, some distant relations of the couple apparently believed her. However, immediate family members did not accept her and when she died in 1992, it seemed as it the mystery rested there.

> However, it was revived on the centenary of the sinking in 2012 when Kramer‚Äôs granddaughter, Debrina Woods, from Florida, restated the claim on a series of forums dedicated to the Titanic.

> She set up a website, selling posters, mugs and mouse mats highlighting her claim and said she planned to write a book about the story.

> She claimed she had found a suitcase belonging to her grandmother which was full of documents substantiating the family case. She also tried to contact the Allison family and arrange a visit, prompting the intervention of their lawyers to ask her to cease. A restraining order was even taken out to stop Ms Woods scattering her grandmother‚Äôs ashes over the Allison family plot, in Chesterville, Ontario, with extra security measures put in place, when she paid a visit to the area.

> If her claim was established, she would be eligible to inherit much of the family wealth, and the issue has divided Titanic experts. While many were sceptical, others were supportive of her case. The debate led to the founding of the identification project, by Tracy Oost, a forensic scientist at Laurentian University, in Canada and Titanic researcher.

> She asked both sides to take part in the DNA screening, to test their Mitochondrial DNA, which passes through the maternal line.

> Sally Kirkelie, the great niece of Loraine‚Äôs mother, agreed to take part, and although Mrs Woods declined, her half sister, Deanne Jennings, who shared the same mother and same link to Helen Kramer, agreed.

> David Allison, grandson of Hudson‚Äôs brother Percy Allison, said: ‚ÄúThe Allisons never accepted Mrs Kramer‚Äôs claim, but the stress it caused was real. It forced my ancestors to relive painful memories described to me as immeasurable sorrow and unending grief.

> ‚ÄúI would like to thank Deanne Jennings and Sally Kirkelie for offering their DNA to stop this harassment. This was a courageous, selfless act, and I will remain forever indebted for their act of kindness.‚Äù

> Nancy Bergman, a sister of David‚Äôs, said: ‚ÄúThese DNA results have uncovered a colossal fraud that has haunted my family for years. It was all about the money ‚Ä¶. Debrina wants to write a book and no doubt there are others out there who want to profit from our story. It is our story. Leave us in peace.‚Äù

> Prof Oost said: ‚ÄúIt is good to have a resolution here, but we mustn‚Äôt forget that this is all about one of the more tragic of tales to come from the Titanic. The only mystery that remains now is who was Helen Kramer.‚Äù

> Further investigation suggests she was raised in Michigan, as Evangline Irene Lee Hyde. However Ms Woods, 61, a retired chef, is standing by her claims. She declined to comment on the DNA results, but said she had her own DNA evidence and the support of other members of the Allison family. The results, she said, will be revealed in a book she is currently writing. She also insisted she never intended to scatter her grandmother‚Äôs ashes at the Allison family plot. ‚ÄúWe want to present the whole evidence. Not just come out with public findings,‚Äù she added.

> She denied harassing the family and insisted she had no interest in their money.

> ‚ÄúIt is rubbish to suggest it is about money or claim I have harassed anyone. This was never about money. My grandmother never wanted money and I don‚Äôt either.‚Äù

> The project echoes the exposure of a similar bogus claim, made by Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Anastasia, the youngest daughter of the Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, who was killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918. After her death, DNA research proved there was no genetic link between the woman and the family."

Edit:

People of Reddit who thought Hawaii was part of a continent, where are you now?"
1522,"Dunno why you are getting down voted for speaking facts ü§î. But considering most people commenting on here didn't know Hawaii was an island, I can kinda see why.

Edit: also to those who will post that it is, it's considered an island continent because it's the only one that isnt attached to any other landmass. Still a continent though."
1523,"For everyone commenting on the dog had to stay because of his broken leg:

Dogs are really good at walking on 3 legs, and will drag themselves on 2 if they have to. In situations like this, the dog is usually so terrified that they just run after being hit, so it‚Äôs pretty remarkable that he did stay and do the job he was trained to do."
1524,"Awesome!  In 2014,  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) Los Angeles awarded their most heroic dog of 2014, to a cat.

Tara, a 6-year-old cat living with her human family in Bakersfield, California, raced into action when her 4-year-old human companion, Jeremy, was attacked without warning or provocation by a neighbor‚Äôs roaming dog. The entire incident was caught on security cameras and the video posted on YouTube by Jeremy‚Äôs father, Roger Triantafilo.

The boy had been playing quietly on his tricycle in his family‚Äôs driveway when the dog spied him and ran into the yard, grabbed his bare leg, and dragged him from his trike. With his teeth clamped into Jeremy‚Äôs leg, the dog was dragging the boy across the driveway and shaking his head violently when Tara sprinted toward them, slamming her body into the dog. The startled dog released Jeremy and ran, with Tara close behind him."

I mean, I‚Äôve even heard they consider the term ‚Äúpet‚Äù as meaning you own the animal instead of being equals and should call them instead ‚Äúanimal companions‚Äù 

But semantics aside, I‚Äôm kinda shocked they haven‚Äôt consider service animals as some kind of slavery and unfair to these animals that should be given the same rights as people."

1626,Anyone who says he didn't move because he had a hurt leg clearly have no idea how survival instincts work especially in animals if the dog wanted to move he could have mostly likely had the adrenalin rush need to run away but no the dog over came the natural instinct to run because of its training and loyalty to it's handler. Dogs have been with us for thousands of years we evolved around them and they did the same.

If I kick your dog for biting me, I won't be having any assault charges. It's seriously fucked up. They send in a dog, and the dog can receive the assault instead of the cowardly K9 officer.

1653,"From what I can gather from other news articles about this same incident, the woman was already in the middle of the road when a mini bus came towards her. That's when the guide dog ran \*towards\* the bus, putting himself between the vehicle and his owner. Not that he ran ""onto"" the road."
1654,"I just read the article, and though it doesn't explicitly state where they were, it does say that they were ""**cross**ing the street"".  That's when it clicked in my head, and I realized they were probably on a **cross**walk, and the bus probably wasn't stopping/yielding appropriately."
1655,That's what I'm trying to figure out... Why were they walking in front of a bus?
1656,The bus ran a cross walk i guess? idk. Driver was charged with not yielding.

1660,"Considering they still have 3 very functioning legs, they could go wherever they want."
1661,Away from immediate danger using 3 legs?
1662,"You sweet summer child.

Watched too many bad videos on r/wtf and other subs to know they can run on three or drag on two. Dog stayed for their owner in this case."
1663,"I wish I didn't know how wrong you are, because it's the kind of imagery that really sticks with you."
1664,"Hail a cab to the vet, duh. Probably just cant catch a cab as a dog in NYC even in 2015. Damn shame."
1665,no you wouldn't.
1666,Dogs can easily walk with 3 legs.
1667,"maybe for you, for a dog it isn't"
1668,You'd be surprised. Dogs muscle through a lot
1669,"Dogs are good at walking with 3 legs, and can even drag itself with 2 if frightened, which I‚Äôm sure it was, but it stayed anyways"
1670,Geez man try to have some positivity
1671,Not for a dog. Dogs can sprint on three legs
1672,"Right? In other news, the dog knows all its owner‚Äôs secrets, but has never told anyone."
1673,"Assuming there were no squirrels, cats, or tennis balls on the radar screen you might be right.

They usually take off, with all their legs or without."
1674,I came to say the same thing :-)
1675,"Our world would not be as it is today without elephants,herbivores, and dogs. They carved out a lot of what made the human population large, successful, and sustainable over time."

1686,Or into a wok
1687,">and totally out of character for a dog from NY.

lol"
1688,I mean what is there to understand? Did you read the story?
1689,Technically we evolved them.
1690,"I've seen a dog with a broken leg run at a full sprint on 3 legs just to chase a squirrel. As soon as it got away up a tree she just laid down like, ""Oh I shouldn't have done that""."
1691,Technically IAmBecomingADog
1692,"How many stories are there of people getting hit by cars while saving a random dog? Lots, we weren‚Äôt technically trained for this but our loyalty for Canine‚Äôs is there."
1693,"Shit, if I got hit by a bus I'd probably try getting the hell out of there too, broken leg or not. Fight or flight is a hell of an instinct"
1694,"What was the dog gonna do, drive to the hospital?"
1695,im sorry what
1696,"Hmm, give me a few days, I want to test this theory, *and I have just the axe for this!*"
1697,Probably just a colloquialism in this case. We tend to use speech that refers to the wrong type of sense in many instances. Like when someone says ‚Äúhappy to hear from you‚Äù in response to a text or email.
1698,many blind people aren‚Äôt *fully* blind per se and they may have been able to make out the shapes of the dog/bus etc
1699,Sometimes being legally blind means you can still see shadows and close movement. But I don't know in this case.
1700,"The blind people in our residence commonly use phrases such as ""I see"" and ""I am reading this (audio)book""."
1701,"Perhaps they were visually impaired enough where they weren‚Äôt 100% without any vision, but still needs the assistance of a service dog"
1702,Not sure if you are joking or not but some people who are legally blind can still see somewhat.
1703,People can be legally utterly blind and still see a smidge of stuff
1704,There are different versions of blind people. Super blind vs kinda can't see that well. üòëvsü§ì
1705,"A person in my country can be counted as blind even if its possible to see general shapes, 0.1 in sight is the legal requirement, I dunno if every country uses the same scale but as far as i know we just say 0.1 in sight."
1706,"Legal blindness is just vision that is at best 20/200 with corrective measures or an acuity field of less than 20 degrees (most people have a field of 140)

For reference, if your prescription is around -2, that's about 20/200 *uncorrected*."
1707,"Many people who are classified as blind still have some degree of vision left. For example, people with early-stage glaucoma can generally see straight ahead, but they progressively lose peripheral vision until they are completely blind."
1708,"Wait. Wasn't the dog supposed to stop the owner from walking in front of busses?

#YouHadOneJob"
1709,"Reminder that IRL blindness isn't just blackness. You can be blind and see some light or or movement, depending. People are kind of binary about disability, as when they think people who can walk but use a wheelchair sometimes are faking it."
1710,Not everyone who's legally blind is totally without sight
1711,He was just scratching his dick and balls
1712,He's just scratching his cawk and bawls
1713,"Lol wut? No dogs will generally run and hide or try and get away from the giant thing that just hit them. It's quite unusual for him to just stay there, but considering he's a trained service animal it's probably not as unusual as the article makes it sound?"
1714,There's a Wikipedia page about her too. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_(cat)
1715,"My friend had a cat that did something similar. A calico named Wendy. Wendy was the type of cat who only let you pet her when she wanted. Any attempt before that got you mauled. Then when she did let you it was still a crap shoot because if you didn't stop exactly when she wanted, and you got no warning, you got mauled. So we just figured Wendy was a bitch and liked no one.

So same kind of scenario me and my friend were teens at the time, outside working on something. A dog comes running out of the woods growling and barking lunging at us. Cue Wendy flying in out of nowhere, attacks the dog and runs it off. She then came back to both of us, I guess to make sure we were ok, let us give her a couple scritches, then bit the shit out of us and ran back off to do whatever it was she does.

My friend was like bro, Wendy does love us! I'm not so sure I think we're her bitches and nobody else is allowed to bite us but her."
1716,"I haven‚Äôt laughed harder in a long time than I just did watching the entire video with sound on. My god, how tone deaf can you be while editing."
1717,"Damn, that cat acted FAST. I've only ever seen those ""must protect my owner"" instincts in dogs before!"
1718,Why did the lady not pick up the kid and run in the house? Why check on the kid and then run in? Even if you are calling for an ambulance take the kid away from the dog.
1719,"Fuck that dog. Honestly if that was my kid, I would‚Äôve killed it"
1720,So was that lady
1721,"So, not a tricycle."
1722,"I like at the end the cat's like ""wait no what am I DOING"" and turns around.

Been there bro.  Been there."
1723,Cats are alpha as fuck. Anyone who has owned both in the same house will tell you the cats are always in charge.
1724,"If I was the mom, once I got my kid safely secured, I‚Äôd grab a shovel and end that dog‚Äôs life"
1725,"There are a lot of things that can go into a random animal attack.  Perhaps the dog viewed more than just it's own yard as it's territory and thus felt like it was protecting its owner by attacking something approaching.  Or it could have been poorly treated and had become aggressive.

Sometimes dogs will develop a dislike for children because of the way the children are closer to their eye level. They view them as a threat.  It's really strange.  When my German Shepherd was a puppy he hated children.  Now that he's grown he loves them.  I was really worried when he was a pup though that he'd not grow out of it."
1726,"According to the wiki page for the cat, the dog was spontaneously violent and quarantined to test for rabies. During the quarantine, they determined the dog was too hostile to adopt out, and euthanized it much to the despair of animal rights groups."
1727,"That shoulder-check was the cat saying ""Hey! That's my bread and butter you're fucking with."""
1728,"My dog hates anything on wheels like bicycles and stuff, probably got startled or intimidated."
1729,The ducking and sneaking around the car is very worrisome.
1730,"dogs are still just animals

perfectly friendly dog tore into my friends cousin one day, absolutely out of nowhere. he wasnt even near or looking at the dog, it just pounced on him and ripped his face open.

theyre usually great animals but some just snap for no reason, cant trust em"
1731,Because lots of dogs just do that.  They're dumb animals that attack shit because it's in their nature.
1732,Pit bull
1733,The breed.
1734,"Yeah wtf why not just give the cat a cat award. Make a ""Most heroic cat"" of the year award, even if you just hand it out for this one year."
1735,Tell PETA errybody gotta work. Even the dogs.
1736,Imagine being recognised as such a crappy organisation that people even start to fear living day to day because their guide animal could be taken away.
1737,"That‚Äôs horrible, I‚Äôm sorry. 

But then how exactly do they come to the conclusion that service animals are abused during training? Like that makes literally no sense at all. 

Not to mention the fact that most (if not all) people who can finally get a service animal probably absolutely adore their animal and everything they do for them. I‚Äôd be fucking shocked if it ever came out that somebody with a legitimate condition actually abused their service animal."
1738,Yet they euthanize how many pets a year
1739,"I know there‚Äôs lots of controversy about the living conditions of many livestock animals. And I do think it‚Äôs horrible the kind of lives chickens live and the conditions they‚Äôre kept in. 

And at the same time, harvesting honey literally does not harm a bee at all. Bees are going extinct and play huge roles in pollination. So if we can‚Äôt have livestock and consequently have to essentially go vegan, according to their ideals, how the fuck will we grow enough crops to eat without any damn bees to pollinate? 

I‚Äôm not a fan of zoos either but like... I‚Äôm not off the deep end like most of those groups tend to be."
1740,what a load of shit
1741,YES. ASPCA is reputable.
1742,ASPCA doesn‚Äôt bother me when one of their members sees me/follows me home after I leave my dog in a running car for 30 seconds with the AC on full blast to buy him fancy ass apple cinnamon treats from a specialty pet store for being a good boy at the vet.
1743,"wtf your wtf.

Obviously you do not have much experience with Golden Retrievers. All Goldens look that. They are very happy dogs.

Always"
1744,Dogs like these are the reason I have a dashcam! Insurance frawd is *no joke*
1745,"My high school biology teacher was a Phd biologist who had worked for the army doing research on radiation debilitation of animals as a proxy for humans. Goats were their model. The group wanted to know how long an animal (proxy human) could function after receiving a lethal dose. His group found that the best way to motivate the goats was by irradiating a goat that had been separated from its flock and then seeing how long it would go trying to reunite. Truly horrific stuff. But the desire to be back with its family was the strongest motivator that they could find. Animals value family just as much as humans do, sometimes more. The Cold War was horrible and motivated humans to do some truly horrendous shit."
1746,Please tell me your dog ended up being okay. Please?
1747,Why not?
1748,Would.
1749,"he did, he's positive that dogs leg was broken... man read between the lines and outside the box."

1754,"Even more technically, they evolved us"
1755,"Well, one could also argue that we ""devolved"" them. Or how do you explain Chiuahuas (also called the Spawn of Hell)."
1756,"""Who evolved who?"" would make a great bumper sticker."
1757,"Theory of auto-domestication, they evolved themselves before we ever had an idea of breeding and intent."
1758,">Technically we evolved them.

How so?"
1759,Intelligent design is real.
1760,The dog could've moved but it didn't.
1761,Never notice grammar and punctuation till it's gone.
1762,"We helped dogs evolve and they helped us evolve.  Humans and dogs have a long history together. Wolves used to follow humans around, probably in order to get leftovers from kills, then we started working together and that combo allowed us change in a numerous amount of ways."
1763,"If the last sentence is confusing, basically we adapted to each other."
1764,"Or when you put music into braille and they say, ""this shit bumps"""
1765,"I have a 100% blind friend that says ""see ya later"" all the time. It was weird the first few times like, ""wait, is he messing with me?"" But you realize it really is just a colloquium when you see him walk face first into a desk or wall."
1766,I feel you bruh.
1767,That and it's modern language and blind people are allowed to use it. OP commenter doesn't need to nitpick.
1768,"Blindness is more of a scale than a binary.

Legally, *I'm* blind, but absolutely zero people would actually consider me blind."
1769,I was in college with a lady who was supposedly blind. She had a white cane and everything. I once saw her get into a car and drive off.
1770,I had a legally blind student who still learned to identify pictures of her classmates and partially communicate through picture exchange communication(she was nonverbal).
1771,"I say ""look at this"" to my blind cousin (he's like a little brother to me so we have are close) when I want him to grab something or just to touch something because seeing something is touching It for him (and he sais ""let me see"" if he wants to grab something). Only people without knowledge of how blind people behave would be surprised about the use of the word see."
1772,Wouldn't it be more like üòévs ü§ì
1773,"My dog stayed when hit by a car. Then he tried to bite the driver in the ankle. His spine was fucked for a bit, but recovered"

1775,"From that same page:

>At the end of the mandatory 10-day quarantine period, Scrappy was euthanized despite opposition from animal groups and online petitioners.

The dog was tested for rabies, and then when Animal Control realized it didn't and was just aggressive, retards online tried to stop it from being put down.  The hell's wrong with them."

1779,...are you sure you're replying to the right comment?
1780,"I had a cat that would guard the house and yard.  He was a maine coon and siamese mix, both known for dog like behaviour.  25 pounds of tubby big bone fury."
1781,"The difference between cats and dogs is that dogs connect to a pack, while cats connect to individuals. They are just as loyal, only the circle of concern is smaller."
1782,One of the youtube comments says it was to see where the dog went according to an interview with her.
1783,Some people have zero situational awareness.
1784,The dog was put down after this incident.
1785,"Sorry to say, I would have killed the dog if that was my dog.  I suspect that's what happened."
1786,Chill
1787,"My German Shepard was the same when she was little. My mates' kids won her over with treats and now she's old she is great with kids. But I'm always wary when there's children around. Personally, I wouldn't leave a kid unsupervised with any dog, no matter how chill and how well you know it."
1788,"It's also possible the kid had teased it over a period of time and the dog saw its chance to retaliate. Although the dog didn't look extremely hostile (barking, growling, etc) may have just thought it was playing and didn't have the awareness to know kids can't be dragged by the leg ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Edit: Ok playing was a bit naive. However, I just meant it wasn't malicious, it wasn't taught attacking a human was bad. My point is, most dogs do not attack children, either they are trained to be aggressive, they are pushed passed their limits by said kid, or they are not trained enough to know better. In my opinion this one wasn't trained enough."
1789,"I mean, what dog isn't euthanized after attacking a child? I feel for the dog who was just following it's instincts (or possibly even it's training), but what else can be done with an animal like that? It's hard enough to find homes for strays without also having to find safe homes for the violent ones."
1790,Yep I was told my wheels make my dog have a desire to hunt or something and it goes kinda crazy. And my dog is like the most innocent dog ever otherwise
1791,That was one of my thoughts too. Maybe the trike was poorly oiled and squeaky which freaked the dog out.
1792,"My pops trains dogs for a living, been that way all my life.

This is never an out of nowhere type of thing."
1793,">some just snap for no reason, cant trust em  
  
  
I'll call BS on this one, you can train and then trust any dog. Anyone who says ""it was a good dog, he never done anything wrong"" is just lying piece of shit."
1794,This is NEVER the correct answer. This dog was a shithead propably because their owners are shitheads. That dog looks like a basic mutt.
1795,Tell peta to get fucked*. I'd lose my shit if someone sjw'ed me over my own dog
1796,This.
1797,"It varies. Seeing eye dogs are the main source, because they have to be reaction-less. There‚Äôs a stoic ness associated with them, often called ‚Äúbomb proof‚Äù, which rumors say is done by putting the dogs in super loud rooms, loud noises, essentially that they‚Äôre shell shocked into this state. Of course this isn‚Äôt the case and anyone who‚Äôs seen a SD off duty knows that, but it persists."
1798,"People like to exaggerate when they tell stories. If they‚Äôre talking to someone they like and trust, they‚Äôre likely to believe their friend‚Äôs exaggerations. So they repeat them, and probably add a few exaggerations of their own onto the story. Eventually the story that goes around is twisted far beyond the original. That‚Äôs how you get shit like ‚ÄúKFC doesn‚Äôt stand for Kentucky fried chicken anymore because they abuse their chickens to the point that they‚Äôre no longer legally considered chickens!‚Äù (Real thing I‚Äôve heard). In reality it stopped standing for anything because their marketing team decided that was a better choice and while I wouldn‚Äôt want to be a factory farmed chicken, they‚Äôre still legally chickens. 

I can think of a few more examples that will probably make you say ‚Äúwut‚Äù. From what I can tell they all start with a bunch of people in a bubble telling stories to each other."
1799,"Not enough to make a substantial dent in the population of unwanted domestic animals. 

The simple reality is that there are not enough homes for all the strays that need to be adopted, and the only humane thing to do is give them a painless death. 

The alternative is a life spent in a cage, which denies resources to other animals people might adopt."
1800,"PETA sucks, but they get a bad rap for this. No kill shelters send their animals over to petas shelters to keep their record clean"
1801,"Zoos are actually really legit research/breeding facilities as long as they're actual zoos and not some hillbilly with a tiger. They raise awareness of endangered species, maintain a genetic pool of animals away from poachers, work hard to fulfill natural behaviors, and encourage stewardship. As a veterinarian I have nothing but respect for zoos."
1802,"There are 20,000 species of bee, most of which don‚Äôt produce honey. Untold trillions of native bees have been killed by introduced honey bees - which are *not* endangered or under threat - so that we have something to wipe on our toast in the morning. 

Honey bees typically only pollinate one particular species of plant, so when they replace native bee populations the local ecosystem is thrown out of balance.

Commercial bee farms selectively breed bees to increase production, which has lead to the emergence of new and novel diseases that spread from introduced honey bee populations to native populations and other pollinators. 

And harvesting honey absolutely does harm bees. Some commercial beekeepers kill their bees rather than store and feed them during winter, and plenty are accidentally killed during the harvesting process."
1803,Those jerkoffs need to learn how to choose their battles.
1804,"I was in 4h for a few years.  I remember being told Goats are the most social farm animal.  If you have a depressed animal, you get them a goat or two.  I spent countless hours with my friend on her family's farm.  We would take our goats out of the field to train a few times a week.  My goat had a distinct bleet when the herd first greeted us, same way every time but just for the greeting.  Just with us.  Goats are very vocal animals and I swear they have ""words"" for things. 


A Billy goat will also piss on his own face and smile about it, so ymmv.  Goats can have total distinct personalities and are absolutely emotional creatures. 

Thanks for being unwilling bros to our research, radioactive goats."
1805,Go see r/AnimalsBeingBros you'll see a lot of cats (and other nice animals) caring about people ;)
1806,"Even MORE technically, I love all dogs."
1807,"Most technically, it was coevolution of both in parallel. That's why there's a positive oxytocin-releasing feedback loop between dogs and humans when they're gazing at each other whereas there is none when wolves and humans gaze at each other."
1808,No
1809,"There are more Chihuahuas in the world than there are wolves, so from a selective perspective Chihuahuas definitely have evolved from wolves."
1810,Large dogs are often trained to behave well since acting out as a large dog has more effect. Small dogs more often are less strictly trained since they are so small and it is not as big deal if they act out. A Chiuahua can be just as nice as any other dog if it has a good training.
1811,"100 000+ years of selective breeding. Not a single dog today exists as a result of randomness in nature's normal way of evolution.

Every single dog you see, exists because humans wanted them to look like that, and it keeps getting worse. These new breeds of ""purse dogs"" can barely even walk, they just tippy tap around. And people buy them like mad because this completely useless little freak of nature is ""soooo cuuute ommgg!!""

Some breed of dogs have thankfully been kept mostly intact, like the german sheperd, that breed is crazy old. Altho several popular kennel clubs have made it a thing to aquire german sheperd with a growth deficency in their back legs, forcing them to walk around on shorter legs like this one https://youtu.be/_hzs2Ebf-W4"
1812,"> Never notice grammar and punctuation till it's gone.

1814,Hahaha
1815,"idk man, but if I'd be blind I would be sayin shit like that all the time to fuck with people... that and also walk face first into walls"
1816,"I knew a blind guy who would act super offended whenever other people used colloquialisms like that around him...just to mess with them. While, of, course, using them himself.

Didn't like him much, but it was some pretty effective trolling."
1817,Hm.. OH
1818,I hear yah man.
1819,Have a nice weekend and I'll hear the closeness of you due to how the sound of my voice getting dampened by your body on monday!
1820,"Same with me and being deaf. 

Well that‚Äôs a lie plenty of my friends consider me deaf hahaha. But coworkers etc have no idea"
1821,"I feel this. Last i checked i either fell under it or was close, without glasses i cant read even large text from more than about a foot and a half away.

Have walked in front of moving vehicles because i couldnt see them coming outside 15ft, also regularly walk around my house without glasses because i can get by without for some things. Its definitely a scale that most people dont realize extends so far."
1822,"Yup, always have to explain to people that legally speaking I'm blind but i can still use glasses and contacts. I think a lot of people who have normal sight don't realize that at some point it can still be corrected but there's NO WAY your seeing with out assistance. Usually giving people my glasses does the trick."
1823,"Then again, you don‚Äôt need a seeing eye dog, do you? It‚Äôs pretty clear that he‚Äôs at least, pretty close to complete blindness."

1826,"One of our residents was at the local government hospital, and was directed by a nurse ""Go there.""
""I can't see where you're pointing; I'm blind.""
""But you have eyes!"" the nurse exclaimed."
1827,"This! 

 I was an aid for blind students on campus and in my training it's specifically stated to not intentionally avoid using words ""see"" or ""look"" etc if it comes up naturally. Since most people would say ""look at this"" to anyone they are talking to, it's completely natural and okay to say it to someone who is blind. 

So the person who is blind in the article saying ""I was happy to see him"" is okay. Just because they don't ""see"" in the traditional sense (pun intended) doesn't mean they aren't ""seeing""."

1831,"You cannot test a live animal for rabies yet. It's in the works, but right now you have to euthanize the animal, then send the brain for testing. What they did was watch him for 10 days. If an animal has been infected with rabies and was at the point where the virus was in its saliva at the time that it bit another animal/person, they should almost certainly die within a week of the incident."
1832,They would prefer it be imprisoned for life for violently attacking a child unprovoked.
1833,"I read that whole article, where does it say Scrappy was tested for rabies? All it says is he was quarantined and determined to be vicious and aggressive."
1834,r/dogfree
1835,"Pretty sure they're referring to the upbeat music at the end with the big ""SUBSCRIBE."""
1836,Me too
1837,That is exactly what I would say in an interview about a situation where I got freaked out and ran off without my kid
1838,"Okay, not a bad idea. But I would probably pick the child up incase if I went around front the dog comes back around the back of the vehicle. I am in no way a jump in to action kind of guy sadly, but I am a get my wife and kids out of harm's way kind of guy."
1839,"As sad as it is, if this hasn‚Äôt been trained out of the dog from an impressionable age, those instincts will always prevail. 

Bring the downvotes. It‚Äôs true."
1840,That‚Äôs a reasonable response to a dog randomly attacking a child. And the dog was euthanized.
1841,Go watch your hentai weeb
1842,"The dog's motive is impossible to determine from this video, but it clearly wasn't playing. The violent head shaking was way too much for playing. This motherfucker was fighting."
1843,"What are you talking about? That dog was hostile as fuck. Just look at his body language pre attack, that‚Äôs full on hunting to kill mode, not barking to warn off a threat mode."
1844,"Well everything you said applies to some humans too, yet we don‚Äôt kill them."
1845,"Maybe, but you'd think we would at least make an attempt. That's what I think bothers people the most. If you try and fail, you can say you did your best. If you refuse to try, it feels like a hollow excuse."
1846,This has been my experience as well. I chalk it up to folks who aren‚Äôt around animals enough to be able to read the subtle signs.
1847,"Not to be argumentative, but i am a dog trainer and once i was bit by a dog that even i didn't see warning signs despite having trained extensively to read canine body language...... However you're correct 99.9% of the time."
1848,"Absolutely agree. Dad was a veterinarian, so I‚Äôve known quite a few dogs. I‚Äôve never heard of a dog attacking someone before the dog was well known to be unstable or giving plenty of forewarning. The only time it‚Äôs ‚Äúout of nowhere‚Äù is from either oblivious or malicious owners. The most common of which is ignoring that the dog warned them many times. ‚ÄúOh, she always growls when people get near her while she‚Äôs eating, but this time she just attacked out of no where!‚Äù She was literally letting you know every time that she was uncomfortable. If she could speak she would have been saying, ‚ÄúI am going to bite you if you keep messing with my food.‚Äù"
1849,"Okay... except 66% of fatal dog attacks in us are pitbulls src: https://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-multi-year-fatality-report-2005-2017.php

There are good dogs and bad dogs, but certain breeds (chihuahuas too!) have propensities for aggressiveness. 

Pitbulls are in the running for top aggressive breed in almost any search.

I‚Äôm not campaigning for a cause or shilling for a breed, just Posting fucking truth.

Ownership plays a big part, but there‚Äôs a real reason that people are polarized on pitbulls."
1850,Those people should get a job in retail and then see how ‚Äúbomb proof‚Äù they become
1851,"What about the repeated reports of them taking dogs/cats from yards, from homeless people and then euthanizing them?  


PETA is a fucking joke."
1852,"PETA runs shelters where they don't attempt to adopt out pets at all - some 99% of their pets at these shelters are killed. They believe that animals are better off dead, then pets.

 This argument is fair for a regular shelter that has to put down some animals, though. It's just PETA is much more extreme."
1853,Well not all euthanizing shelters are PETA shelters. But yeah whenever I hear a region as gone mostly or totally no kill. I always feel awful since that means they other send them all somewhere else or they flat out refuse to take some animals. Putting more strain elsewhere and people throwing their pets away.
1854,So wait why does peta suck? They‚Äôve done more to make significant steps toward non-human animal welfare than arguably any other individual org in recent history.
1855,"My secondary school for some unknown reason, it was a technology school in Central London, had a few goats. They were right cunts. Hilarious initially but they got old fast. 

One got loose during a PE lesson so my class had to spend 10 minutes chasing it around and trying to get it to leave a music classroom after some idiot opened the door for the goat.

I'm talking wrestling this goat by the horns trying to stay away from the dozen mac pros floating around. 

Still less annoying than the roosters that would never shut up right outside my history room."
1856,Fuck do I have to stop eating goats too now? I need to stop reading these animals facts.
1857,Now that's what I call science üëå
1858,"Even most technically, we have become better people because of dogs."
1859,...I love you Techno Dog.
1860,That's what's UP my man
1861,You've never met furry
1862,"Well, I would say they devolved from wolves."
1863,I was mainly talking about their physical traits. They are ugly as fuck and look like something that was born from an unholy union of some demon and a wolf.
1864,I somewhere read that shorthaired chihuahuas are actually still pretty 'wild': that they were found as wild dogs until a century ago or so (and have not been bred into docile dogs yet). As opposed to other dogs which have been bred into their docile characters for centuries. I would be happy if somebody could let me know whether I have been gullible?
1865,"I think he was talking about the many physical ailments that plague the chihuahua. Poor thing, same with bulldogs or those pointy faced dogs (all the breeds to be honest)."
1866,Excellent. Follow orders like a good grammar Nazi.
1867,"WHAT? SPEAK UP PLEASE, I'M MUTE!"
1868,"He was joking, but on a serious note there is sheet music in Braille for blind musicians."
1869,"r/whooooosh 

Braille - Bumps 
It was a clever joke."
1870,Smell ya later.
1871,They just think you are ignoring them.
1872,"I have a friend whose legally blind without her glasses, but with them she can Drive!?! That sounds scary until you realise the scale of blindness."
1873,"It might vary by state? In mine, 20/200 or worse is considered legally blind. That's around -2.5. I'm like -5.5 in my left eye, and -4.0 in my right eye. Add in a couple complicating factors and I can also function without glasses, at least around the house. I can read text from half a foot or so. 

Sometimes it's nice to take my glasses off my face and just read or do something without them.

Some people do seem to think that vision is just a toggle. Like once you hit some arbitrary point your eyes just stop working. Had a girl ask me if I could see color without my contacts once."
1874,I can only see for 6 inches before everything goes blurry. I've started to wear contacts though and my God the difference.
1875,"Um, no. I don't. I wasn't trying to say the guy didn't qualify, rather I was elaborating that you *can* be blind but still have the ability to see at least some things."
1876,As someone legally blind in one eye this joke was annoying by the time I was 10. I‚Äôm pretty sure every single person I‚Äôve told has made an illegally blind joke. Just one of those things people don‚Äôt realise is overdone
1877,"You're 2/2 on bad jokes, my guy."
1878,That was interesting
1879,What a chill cat.
1880,"Watching that video all I keep thinking is ""support the back legs!"". Slowly we see Tara slinking more in lol"
1881,"Why would they do this to that poor cat?

Hey, thanks for saving that kid and all, but we really need you to put some mustard on this 2 seamer here. It's like you're not even trying..."
1882,That was next-level awkward. They really tried to make the cat throw it.
1883,"Thanks for the sauce.  I don't know what I was expecting with a cat throwing out a first pitch, it should have been that, but it wasn't."
1884,That was art.
1885,Okay but what kind of fucking ball was that? It defies the laws of physics
1886,What is life?
1887,The what?
1888,How do you know if was unprovoked? You can't hear what the kid said And you don't know if anything went on before the video started.
1889,Why are you downvoted?  I'm already subbed
1890,Yup that subscribe music freaked me out
1891,"Ohh gotcha I had the sound off so I didn't hear anything

Edit: yeah I know what I said..in my sick addled brain"
1892,"Rabies kills.

And the rabies vaccine hurts too I think. I would be looking for the dog to see if it has his shots, wouldn't want to endure that needle for nothing."
1893,"awards are stupid for a dog, they wouldn‚Äôt have a clue wtf is going on, just give them a life supply of doggo treats and be done wit it"
1894,"I'm not expert in ancient humans but I'm pretty sure our ancestors would ""kill the threat"" if it can be done with ease. Could of just been a protective instinct... "" TINY ANIMAL HURT TINY HUMAN MUST KILL UNNGH."" She did walk like a caveman so maybe there is some neanderthal in her."
1895,Maybe there was another kid or someone who she thought was in danger. She was probably in fight or flight and critical thinking takes a backseat usually.
1896,"It was more important to find the dog's owner to sue him, in order to pay for her kid's medical bills."
1897,"I agree. The dog sadly needed to be put down. It was not considered adoptable. I hate to see it happen, but that behavior is inexcusable"
1898,"ugh dude, why weaponize history for this, let people like what they like"
1899,I actually don‚Äôt jerk off to hentai but ok. First time I get called a weeb in a hostile way tho. How exciting
1900,Yeah lets not compare dogs and humans my man
1901,"If animal shelters had the kind of funding that US prisons do, we might not have to kill them. But as I said, it's hard enough to find homes for strays. Perfectly nice dogs are put down just for a lack of space. And a dog like this probably couldn't even be around other dogs."
1902,And if you fail ‚Ä¶ a child gets harmed
1903,"I can understand that mindset, but these people need to think objectively. You're talking about a dog and a child, they're not equal. And who is willing to share in the liability should that animal attack again? I love dogs as much as the next person, it's just at the end of the day, when a dog can become that instantly vicious without any signs, it's really not safe for anyone."
1904,"No, not really, we don't have infinite time and resources to waste on lost causes to make uninformed people feel better about the situation, come on"
1905,"That's actually a terrible example. Getting defensive over food is a characteristic of many breeds, not just individual dogs."
1906,"Shitheads tend to gravitate towards strong breeds. Then they give zero fucks about proper training and socializing.
Pitbulls etc. are shithead magnets and cause maximal damage when owned by a shithead. Not the breed's fault it attracts incompetent dicks."
1907,"These stats are based on bad data, they didn‚Äôt do genetic testing on these dogs. Many times a dog will be labeled a pit bull as general label for a mutt. What is true about true pit bulls is that they have a powerful bite and low pain tolerance. So they tend to inflict a lot of damage and do not stop the attack when attacked. So they are dangerous, but they‚Äôre not a particularly aggressive breed. If this was a pit bull, the scenario likely would have gone very differently."
1908,Pit bulls aren't a breed.
1909,"That was 2 rogue employees who were then promptly fired.

God you people are so fucking stupid to think that is actual PETA policy with no evidence whatsoever.  But if you happen to find it on their website, please do share the link smh."
1910,"That was a couple of isolated incidents that have been repeated ad nauseum by people paid by the meat lobby.

Think what you want about peta, but be careful what you base your opinions on."
1911,">What about the repeated reports of them taking dogs/cats from yards, from homeless people and then euthanizing them?

This is an officially sanctioned activity organized by PETA? Because anyone can claim to be a PETA activist and go around murdering pets. 

>PETA is a fucking joke.

Whatever you need to tell yourself to be okay with supporting the mass incarceration, exploitation, suffering, and murder of animals so you can have cheap meat."
1912,"Many feel like it's better to euthanize them than have them kept as pets or livestock. Yeah a bit twisted, no I'm not joking."
1913,"Our new mobile game, [Rescue Pets](https://www.rescuepets.site), works with a fantastic rescue called [Dog Gone Seattle](https://www.doggoneseattle.org/). They take dogs about to be euthanized in kill shelters, put them in foster homes until they get adopted, and re-train them or provide medical assistance if necessary. It truly is a wonderful organization.

You're definitely right; a lot of no-kill shelters do turn animals away just to keep their name. I wanted to inspire hope for you, though. There's a lot of people across the country/world working on improving this. 

Our game's goal is to share all the best learnings from different shelters, inspire people to volunteer and take better care of animals, and sponsor animals on their journeys to find forever homes. We just started out, but it's looking promising!"
1914,"As someone who's interested in promoting a stable environment for wild fauna and flora, I'd point to examples where ""liberators"" (not necessarily PETA) have snuck or forced their way in to open up mink farms without further planning. This is a poor idea for several reasons, for one the minks wont just survive on happy energy - they need to eat and in areas where the local fauna haven't adapted to such predators the outcomes can be catastrophic (even for the native, less effective predator fauna).

Secondly, it'd be naive to think that more than a small portion of the released population will be able to at all survive in this newly fucked extremely competitive environment that's not natural in the slightest.

I don't agree with mink farming but if you're gonna go to attack against the businesses the least you can do (unless you wanna make and maintain a shelter for hundreds to thousands of mink) is to as ethically as possible kill all the mink there and then take further action in order to prevent the business owners from purchasing new mink."
1915,"At this point about the only meat I can stomach is chicken, but even that twinges my empathy meter. I try to stick to eggs, cheese, and low food chain fish. TVP has been a god send. You can use it in most ground beef dishes. Just hit the spices and other ingredients heavily. Also, look to Quorn products. Their burgers and sausages are quite good. And the Beyond Burger and Impossible Burger are nearly like meet, if still pricy."
1916,"Yep can confirm, I is scientistic."
1917,"I am a mighty and fearsome wolf spirit, trapped inside the flaccid body of an overweight human!"
1918,"The concept of there being one, all powerful furry, and not many individual ones is somehow scarier than I could have anticipated."
1919,"Well, you‚Äôre a retard"
1920,gum disease? most chihuahua's die of old age (18% die of heart disease at 14+ years of age).  Not really comparable to a bulldog or any flat faced breed in most health aspects.
1921,I see what you did there
1922,Sometimes I am just ignoring them. Having a hearing problem comes in handy every now and then üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1923,"That gives me more faith that i probly am on the scale legally, because theres no chance i could drive.

If youre ever curious what it looks like, take a picture with your phone but jerk it sideways at the last second so everything blurs a bit, but not too much to tell outlines of things. Thats a pretty accurate representation of my sight, personally."
1924,I‚Äôm -6.0 in both eyes. Did I just find out I‚Äôm legally blind? What a day.
1925,"Im tempted to get them, my sight is bad enough that i go full Velma if i lose my glasses, damn wire frames are too thin to see from more than a foot.

1926,Sorry I trying not to write that comment but I was weak.
1927,ty i do what i can
1928,I‚Äôve watched more baseball today than I have in fifteen years. First watched a gif of a guy puke a river on himself and now I‚Äôve watched a cat throw a pitch. Reddit‚Äôs a magical place
1929,Can we get a video?
1930,"Once you tasted the blood of your enemies, baseball isn't that exciting."
1931,"I think they expected him to ""Hadouken"" into the visiting dugout and win The America."
1932,Did you watch the video? The child literally is on the other side of a car and not even looking at the dog before the attack.
1933,Did you watch the video? It looks like the kid didn't even know the dog was there.
1934,I‚Äôm so confused is this a joke lol?
1935,"This. Rabies is 100% mortality rate. If you get bit by an animal with unknown vaccination history like that you have to get a rabies vaccine at each puncture wound.. that‚Äôs 1ml of vaccine in multiple points of a little kids leg.  
100% mortality rate, if it were my kid? Nah.. go get the dog and send that brain to the lab, I‚Äôd do it myself to save my kid."
1936,"Awards are designed to raise social standing. By giving the animal an award, its chances of getting treats and pets have improved."
1937,"To be fair, I give my dog treats all the time and she still doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on."
1938,"i would run to find the dog to see if it has his rabies shots, if you wait too long it could run away.

otherwise the kid would have to get a rabies vaccine when it could be not necessary."
1939,Yay America!
1940,"Uhhhhhhhhh who said anything about jerking off there, bud"
1941,"Why not? The reason it‚Äôs wrong is because we have a will to live and can experience pain and suffering. This applies to dogs as well, so in this case it‚Äôs logically consistent to compare them, unless you have some other insight you want to share."
1942,I was thinking more about children sent to orphanages than people in prisons.
1943,Seriously so many people in this thread
1944,"I'm not saying we dump the dog on some rando and figure it out later. I'm saying let the people who have the resources and time take the opportunity if they choose to. That wasn't even an option, they just took the dog for it's 10 day waiting period and said they wouldn't let anyone try to adopt it and euthanized it."
1945,"No, it‚Äôs a good example because it‚Äôs easy to train out of dogs as long as you catch it early (when they‚Äôre young/ a puppy)."
1946,Being food aggressive is not normal and it‚Äôs not breed specific. I‚Äôve seen labs and golden retrievers with food aggression. Usually it‚Äôs just one indicator that they‚Äôre acting out dominant tendencies because they don‚Äôt feel that anyone is in charge. Food aggression is an early sign of an unstable dog and can definitely lead to a bite. I‚Äôd recommend getting some help from a professional trainer.
1947,"Thinking PETA is a piece of crap does not equate to being against animal rights.

See I'm very pro animal rights. I just think PETA is not the way to do it and you won't ever see me associated with it. Some days i think the group should be outright banned.

There are plenty of other animal activist groups that aren't a piece of crap or filled with so called ""rogue"" members doing stupid things. Like what PETA was before being filled with morons!"
1948,"Officially sanctioned, yeah....ok. Cause Dubious charities put all their dirt on their official stance. 

And your argument of me supporting murder of animals, because I don't support Peta is a huge dumb ass statement. I'm vegetarian, I'm involved in animal rescue, focusing on house rabbits, dogs and cats. I even did snake rescue for a bit. 

I donate to the African Wildlife Foundaition fighting extinction of animals and the Best friends Animal Society, which actively reduces the amount of animals euthanized by shelters (and PETA) by funding OVER 2,000 rescue and adoption centers in the US.

There are better fucking options and just because I don't support PETA a morally corrupt, dubious at best organization, doesn't mean I support the bullshit you spew. Don't make assumptions you dick."
1949,"That's more than a bit twisted, man. That's full on twisted."
1950,Wish I was like you. All I got is scienbergers.

1958,Look up and imagine a cat throwing a fast ball.  The end.
1959,I'm super sick and hopped up on Nyquil... so I dunno. Lol.
1960,"> that‚Äôs 1ml of vaccine in multiple points of a little kids leg.

Holy shit it's 1ml per puncture!? Thank you for this info.

Also there's the dreaded side-effects post-inoculation: I bet if I got 1ml/puncture of rabies vaccine I would have a fever for a looong time."
1961,You still get rabies over there??
1962,Thought that was implied. People don‚Äôt exactly just watch porn for the plot for fun
1963,Human life is fundamentally more valuable than other life. Deal with it.
1964,There's a teeny tiny slight difference between orphans and violent dogs.
1965,"I don't know if you're young or what, but a dangerous dog does unfortunately need to be destroyed for a plethora of reasons. Not even unfortunately, honestly, it's fairly straightforward. It isn't the dog's fault, but attempting to rehome it is a complete waste of time. If you're going to be upset, be upset at the owner."
1966,"Food aggression IS normal in dogs, it's just not a desirable trait. I also didn't say anything about it being breed-specific. 

>Usually it‚Äôs just one indicator that they‚Äôre acting out dominant tendencies because they don‚Äôt feel that anyone is in charge. 

Sometimes, this is the case and definitely needs to be addressed. But, your argument seems to be based on it always being the case.

Most dogs eat what their owner feeds them with no control over when they are going to get more. If you were in that boat, you'd get defensive too if someone tried to take something from you. Pretty much any dog will growl if they feel uncomfortable with someone around their food. If the dog sees clear hierarchy with it at the bottom, growling is as far as that will go. Just show the dog their food isn't threatened to put it at ease.  If there are no other signs of aggression, this shouldn't be a issue."
1967,"If anyone did that to my doggie, I'd beat them with a tire iron."
1968,"""The doctors always said I was borderline artistic."""
1969,I think you mean down there...
1970,"No, it suggests you havent yet grasped the concept of evolution.

Evolution doesn't care how cool you look or how badass you are, the only factor is how good are you at passing on your genetic information. Wolves clearly failed at that compared to chihuahuas by being too much of a threat to the dominant species on the planet and getting widely exterminated."

1973,"I feel like I‚Äôve mostly seen the bad.... broke arms. Coconut, the lost jolly rancher etc"
1974,I wanted a video of him being interested
1975,Hope you get better my dude.
1976,"Yup the post exposure vx protocol is the full vaccine, 1ml per puncture. The idea is to inject the post exposure vaccine as close to the exposure as possible, just a tiny bit closer to the heart since the potential rabies virus will also be heading back to the rest of your circulatory system.   
So.. if you get bit on your hand with multiple punctures.. 1ml per finger puncture, palm of your hand, in between fingers, wherever. I believe the following 3-4 vaccines over the next 2 weeks are just one injection though. So that‚Äôs nice."
1977,"Not really, with dogs it's a more safe then sorry thing.

Bats still carry it like crazy though."
1978,Get a load of this guy.  He doesn't watch porn for the plot lmao.
1979,"Huh? Where did I say that human life wasn‚Äôt more valuable? Things can have similarities without being equal, and I even said exactly what the similarities were."
1980,"There‚Äôs many differences, but I pointed out the specific similarities."
1981,"Why do you get to make that call, and not the people who want to try? It's not your time or resources, so why do you give a shit?"
1982,I‚Äôd cut their Achilles tendons off with a rusted piece of corrugated steel.
1983,">No, it suggests you havent yet grasped the concept of evolution.

I guess you haven't grasped the concept of a joke yet.

>Wolves clearly failed at that compared to chihuahuas by being too much of a threat to the dominant species on the planet and getting widely exterminated.

That was not natural evolution. It was breeding."
1984,"Ha ha, gross."

1988,Comments like this are why I sometimes go down the reddit-hole. Faith in humanity restored.
1989,Aw thanks. Nyquil is the nectar of the gods so it's helping lol
1990,No one said he was sick
1991,Similarities don't make one thing equal to another. A violent dog has to be put down because shelters don't have enough resources and they also can't be out up for adoption.
1992,"Because it's a dangerous dog, and if some well-meaning idiot fails to rehabilitate the dog (which is extremely likely) it will hurt them or others again. A dog that has been taught wrong, has been traumatised, or has a mental problem takes years of effort to ""fix"" and even then it might snap one day. You can't talk to a dog and understand what it's feeling precisely. It's a waste of time."
1993,"There's probably liability on the ones quarantining the dog. If they release it rather than euthanizing, despite it being a high risk for aggression, and if despite the best efforts of the person taking it in it attacks someone else, that's going to reflect poorly on them. Not just a risk to their job, but also overall public perceptions of their department's ability to manage risk.

I feel you, I have a soft spot for feral cats, those are the ones I want to have a second chance. But it's a much different situation - ferals go out of their way to avoid people, this dog went out of its way to attack one. While yes, it was young, the fact that it attacked so viciously at such a young age is also concerning."
1994,"""Warrior"" is a gender neutral word."
1995,"This was debunked a while ago.

1996,Fr√∏ya?
1997,"IIRC didn't women who died in childbirth also go to Valhalla? 

That might be why they're buried with weapons, because they have earned their place there by, in the viking's view having a death honourable enough."
1998,"I heard a discussion about viking graves recently that put everything into perspective. The archaeologist said that it's impossible to tell what burial practices show because the culture and traditions were always changing and what might be true in one area weren't necessarily true in another area.

A weapon in a grave might signify that he person was a warrior, or that the family was showing they were rich and could discard a valuable weapon, or that the weapon was thought cursed, or that there was a family disagreement over who owned the weapon, or because the person might need it in the afterlife, or a variety of other reasons. All we really know is that the weapon was in the grave, not why.

If the woman's bones were actually from that grave, it could indicate that she was a warrior, but it could also indicate that her husband was a noted warrior, or that she had some authority, or any number of other things. It's all conjecture, we're assuming why based on our own reasons, which might not be the reasons for the people in that time period.

It's possible she was a warrior, the idea wasn't foreign to the Norse, but we can't know for sure. We only know that anyone asserting she was definitely a warrior is intentionally lying or has an ideology that won't allow for other possibilities."
1999,"That shouldn‚Äôt be that surprising, since they considered them equal‚Äôs. But good to know none the less."
2000,She identified as a woman.  It‚Äôs a historical fact that many Vikings were trans.
2001,"Well, heck."
2002,Debunked is a big word for a person doubting the results due to her internalized sexism...
2003,"No, it wasn‚Äôt. Jesch‚Äôs criticism is (admittedly!) speculative and ignores certain points of the original research."
2004,"Oh, great. Now I want fro-yo!"
2005,"Right, but there‚Äôs no reason to specially treat one grave differently from all others, I think."
2006,"Not even close, that is an idealized view perpetuated by historical illiterates.

https://norse-mythology.org/viking-gender-roles/"
2007,"Her chromosomes were XX. If she was trans, she would have consequently identified as a man."
2008,"The article clearly explains how it is almost impossible for the woman to have actually been a fighter.

Furthermore, even if she was (which there is no evidence for), it would be the first example ever found, thus being an extremely rare exception that proves the rule.

The most likely explanation is that she was buried with her husband's possessions after he had died abroad. The article also explains how they have found the graves of children with weapons in them, even though those children clearly were not soldiers. Weapons and armor were expensive symbols of wealth and class during that time, so burying people with those prized possessions of their household makes sense."
2009,The problem with the article is that all the arguments that give can be applied to male tombs too.
2010,"> The most likely explanation is that she was buried with her husband's possessions after he had died abroad.

You have *no* evidence of this at all.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen this before (waaah) and it probably isn‚Äôt her grave (waaah) but if it is, it probably isn‚Äôt her stuff (waaah) but if it is, she probably still wasn‚Äôt a warrior because women can‚Äôt fight anyway (waaah)... BUT IF SHE WAS, SHE WAS THE EXCEPTION (WAAAH)!‚Äù All I hear are waaah waaah waaah excuses to ignore evidence that *would* be calmly accepted."
2011,"The article mentions that many men were buried with weapons even when they weren't fighters either. They were symbols of rank in society. 

Also, again, this is the only example of a Scandinavian woman being buried with weapons in all of archaeological history. There are even doubts that her bones were in that tomb, since they were found in the 19th century at that site and mixed up with other bones, as explained in the article. However, even if she was in that tomb, the most likely explanation is that she was buried with her husband's possessions. If by some miracle she really was a warrior, she would be an exceedingly rare exception to the rule. Viking society was completely male-dominated and women were subject to their husbands or fathers. Also a woman fighting in melee combat would be at an extreme disadvantage, which is one of the many reasons that they haven't been fighters in almost all cultures throughout history."
2012,"That explanation was discussed in the article and makes a lot more sense based on what we know about the Viking era and human civilization in general during the middle ages.

As mentioned in the article, children and men who were not warriors have also been discovered buried with weapons and armor. They were status symbols. 

As Jesch (a female archaeologist and historian) says, it is far more likely that people are seeing what they want to see with this case and jumping to conclusions, despite the overwhelming evidence from all other sources that women were not treated as equals and were especially not warriors. The burden of proof is on the people that desperately want this to be true, not the longstanding consensus that it is not."
2013,Please stop. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
2014,"Oh, wow! Jesch is an archaeologist and historian? Completely unlike the authors of the study apparently:

I suggest you read the [original study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajpa.23308) and its online supplementary materials. The authors have also written a [newer article](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/viking-warrior-women-reassessing-birka-chamber-grave-bj581/7CC691F69FAE51DDE905D27E049FADCD) ([PDF](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7CC691F69FAE51DDE905D27E049FADCD/S0003598X18002582a.pdf/viking_warrior_women_reassessing_birka_chamber_grave_bj581.pdf), [OSM](https://static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:article:S0003598X18002582/resource/name/S0003598X18002582sup001.pdf)), I quote:

>The simple and secure conclusion is that we have the right individual, who was buried alone, and that this person has been proven to be biologically female.

But hey, Annalee Newitz (author of the Ars technica article) probably knows this best of all?"
2015,"It‚Äôs *complete* speculation though and as far as I‚Äôm aware, there‚Äôs no evidence at all that Viking women were buried with her husband‚Äôs belongings. Got any examples of research to the contrary? The researchers say we‚Äôve seen this before, it was her grave, and she was a warrior."
2016,"The part you quoted isn't really relevant to their argument, they're not suggesting that it's not a woman's grave, they're suggesting it's not a warrior's grave.


As prevalent as female warriors were in folklore, I don't really see why it's controversial to assume that a handful actually existed."
2017,"I don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre referring to but DireDistress questioned whether this was the right individual. I don‚Äôt believe anyone is questioning that this is a warrior‚Äôs grave, that‚Äôs quite obviously correct. The grave has been identified as a warrior‚Äôs grave for 142 years, from Stolpe to today."
2018,That's weird because following through their posts it sounded to me like they were offering the theory that it was a woman buried with their warrior husband's possessions. Noted by them literally saying that and also comparing it to children having been found with weapons as well.
2019,There‚Äôs no evidence of that ever having happened. Where is the husband? Where are her possessions?
2020,"We did that in the 20th Century, too."
2021,I like how it gives a picture of a LAN party. The memories...
2022,"Like, is this a satirical post? Who the fuck doesn't know what an ice cream social is?"
2023,OP is going to freak out when he finds out about weenie roasts.
2024,Not... Icecream Sundays?
2025,Ice Cream?! What would the Puritans think of such frivolity?!
2026,[This ain't no ice cream social.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rju4RWdEyZk)
2027,I remember playing Counter-Strike against my brother one on one.
2028,I was curious about this too. Or Sundae Sundays or something like that
2029,I believe Sundaes were actually created because some church group was against ice cream or something.
2030,Finally my username is relevant!
2031,I have literally never heard this word before.
2032,Oh i thought hapa was for Japanese Americans
2033,Is it racist? It seems like it might be.
2034,"Did you have to look it up because you saw it in that comment yesterday? If not, I coincidentally saw the word for the first time yesterday in a Reddit comment."
2035,r/hapas
2036,"Me too... I remember the guy being interviewed by Kido in ""Man in the high castle"" talking about himself this way..."
2037,"In my experience it's only if they're mixed, not entirely of Japanese ancestry."
2038,It seems to be a term mixed race people use to describe themselves.
2039,"it's not racist in any way. hapa people call themselves that.  most college campuses in the west have a Hapa club.

I'm Hapa by some people's standards bc I was born in Hawaii and am biracial (but neither of my parents in Pacific islander)"
2040,"No, I was looking for new subs by hitting the ""random"" button and r/hapas came up."
2041,That subs weird
2042,Imma steer clear. Neat though. Right?
2043,Mmm interesting coincidence then. I wondered what it meant when I read it. Thanks for explaning!
2044,Why? I think it's interesting to see another perspective.
2045,"I would never refer to someone as a ""hapa"" but if someone identified themselves as ""hapa"" at least I know what they mean."
2046,"I'm a part of the sub. There has been a lot of toxic content more recently, specifically because we have been getting more association to incels, meaning a lot of hapa incels feel like they are welcome in our sub. Also there's also a bunch of racist idiots. I should probably leave the sub now that I think of it..."
2047,Solid.
2048,"Douglas was 42 wins, 1 loss?

That detail would‚Äôve changed my views on the way the fight went a bit."
2049,"Tyson's video game is however, undefeated against Douglas's."
2050,"And I bet you can't name three of his opponents.

Ali fought monsters like Sonny Liston, Joe Fraizer, George Foreman, etc."
2051,His estimated odds of winning were 42-1. His record going in was 29‚Äì4‚Äì1.
2052,Yeah 42 to 1 were the longshot odds.
2053,"Super Macho Man, Mr. Sandman, Bald Bull."
2054,"Ali was arguably not even the best of his era, Tyson was unquestionably the best of his."
2055,"Ohhhh, that makes more sense. 

I just remembered Tyson being KO'd by a nobody."
2056,"Ali won Olympic Gold.

Like I said, name a few of Tyson's impressive wins."
2057,"Ali was an all time great but had rivals, Tyson had no rival in his prime."
2058,Had this happen to my next door neighbor about 10 years ago while we were shoveling together. Died before he hit the ground. I was the last person he ever spoke to. Creeped me out for years every time it snowed. I went out and got a snowblower after a while and still snowblow his widows driveway and walk every time.
2059,I believe the reasons shovelling snow triggers heart attacks are the exertion of lifting raises blood pressure coupled with cold air constricting the vascular system. In most cardio rehab classes participants are forbidden from lifting beyond chest height.
2060,"As a cardiology nurse in Canada, I can confirm this. Winter is always our busy season, and one of the cardiologists once said to a patient (who had an MI while shoveling snow), ""When we see there is heavy snowfall, we know we're going to have a busy day."" When I give reports to the next shift and start it with, ""So Mr. Jones was shoveling snow..."" and the other nurse will laugh because we know exactly how this story is going to go."
2061,"My grandfather did not die of a heart attack while shoveling snow.  He actually finished shoveling the driveway.  He died of a heart attack after going inside, taking off his boots, and sitting down in his chair.


Was kind of a weird feeling parking my car in that shoveled driveway when we all got to the house."
2062,Theres only so many times one can shovel 10 millions tons of white bullshit out of the driveway
2063,"Tldr: Shoveling snow is really hard. So if you're 40+ and haven't exerted yourself all year, hire someone."
2064,"Well, it's the only physical exercise they've done all year and they're only doing it now so they can drive to get food and continue to live."
2065,"Mostly it's the rage at having to shovel 3 times per day...


&nbsp;


Sincerely,

Anyone who has actually lived in snow..."
2066,This makes sense as hard work can trigger them and you essencialy are lifting a bucket of water on a 4 foot stick
2067,Just general advice especially for older or ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äú people do not start a rigourous excercise program off the bat. You will need a longer warm up period and a longer cool down period. Unusually in many cases heart attacks occur after sudden physical excercise.
2068,"If it's a really heavy snow and you're not found, at least your body is already on ice."
2069,"At my work, we have to pass a fitness test simulating the act of shoveling snow for 5 minutes straight. Your heart rate can‚Äôt go past a certain threshold or you fail. They simulate this by using a shovel with a 5 lb weight on the end having you go through the motion. It‚Äôs cold, snowy, and remote so this is a necessity in the event of an emergency."
2070,"Commonly, this is because people tend to pick up the snow by the bottom. If there's been a heavy snowfall and you're out there shoveling, you don't have to go all the way down to the ground. You can shovel the same spot twice or more without over-exerting yourself.  


Does it take longer? You bet.  


Will it kill you? Not likely.  


Shoveling the drive is one of those deceptively dangerous things that we don't really think about. If you're not active at all and you suddenly go from couch to 1,000 10lb lifts a minute, you're heart's gonna crap out on you.  


Water is heavy. Like super heavy. Like holy shit how is that so god damn heavy...heavy."
2071,"Basically any sudden strenuous exercise when you aren't used to it can cause heart issues.  (and no, those leisurely jogs on the treadmill last January don't count)"
2072,"When I was a kid I was shoveling during the biggest snowstorm we had ever seen. I felt like my heart was flying out of my chest and feared a heart attack, as a kid. I would never shovel deep snow. Lots of guys looking to make extra money around who do it smarter and better than me and know how to pace themselves."
2073,"6 years ago I was shoveling snow went down. I woke up in the snow called my mom she took me to the hospital they determined it was nothing sent me home a few hrs later. Followed up with my primary doctor. In the subsequent months I had a cardiologist, neurologist and my doctor ran a battery of tests why I kept falling down. The snow incidents was about the only time I lost consciousness the rest were more like ""grey outs"" everything around me stopped and it felt like I had to reboot come back online. My entire family has witnessed this but my doctors still made me feel like I was making it up. That summer I publicly fell on my friend at a concert the band called me out ""oohh somebody had too much to drink"" I was so embarrassed. That summer my neurologist had given up the MRI led no results I stopped going to appointments just gave up. From time to time I still have these ""episodes"" however we're all better at knowing triggers and being on the alert. They're fewer and far between now without any treatment. 

Doctors of Reddit ideas? I'd really like to get to the bottom of this normal people don't just stop talking slur and lean over mid conversation."
2074,"When you go from lifting nothing on a daily basis to lifting hundreds of pounds of snow, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time."
2075,"Omg. We moved away from a snowy New England place because my dad didn‚Äôt want to shovel snow anymore, he was recuperating from a triple bypass surgery. Maybe we dodged a huge fucking bullet. Wow."
2076,"Every time it snows I worry about my Father. I've tried to get over to his place before he's had a chance to shovel, but he always gets to it before me."
2077,"Yeah, people do nothing all year long and then suddenly think they can do 30 minutes of hard exercise and heavy lifting. Everyone underestimates snow."
2078,This is how my house ended up on the market. Previous owner was shoveling my driveway and suffered a massive heart attack. Made it to the hospital to fight for a day then passed. I think of him everytime I snowblow.
2079,Few years ago a guy from work was shovelling then didn‚Äôt feel well. Went for a nap and never woke up. Early to mid 40s smh.
2080,This is why you use a flamethrower.
2081,"Wouldn't that just be a symptom, rather than the actual cause? I mean, if you forced everyone, who has to shovel snow in winter, into the gym, you'd probably end up with the headline ""Going to the gym is a know trigger for heart attacks."". Or am I thinking about this wrong? Is there sth different about shoveling snow from a medical point of view?"
2082,This happened to my grandpa
2083,"We also have ""heart attack snow"".  It's the deceptively heavier wetter stuff."
2084,What other known heart attack triggers are there?
2085,This is why I shovel in segments.  I never shovel the sidewalk and driveway in one sum.
2086,"Makes sense... it kind of forces people to be active where they normally wouldn't, especially elderly that live alone. The shit can get heavy too."
2087,Because people don‚Äôt do anything for exercise and then they go out and throw 10lbs of snow over their shoulder multiple times as fast as they can.
2088,Someone called me weak when I hired a guy to do my driveway. Hell ya I‚Äôm weak but also alive.
2089,"I got a visual migrain (my first and only one so far)  last winter after shovelling. I was home alone with my two young kids, and my husband was away on business. The mail carrier had left a note saying I needed to clear the walkway and sidewal or else they‚Äôd suspend my mail service. So I shovelled that shit in record time while my kids watched from the window. 20 minutes later I started getting this weird kaleidoscope in my vision, but zero pain (no headache at all).  I was trying to read to my son and I couldn‚Äôt see the letters anymore. It was pretty scary. I was just about to call someone for help when it started to clear up on it‚Äôs own, after about 10 minutes. 

That‚Äôs the day I discovered what a visual migrain was."
2090,I shoveled 2.5 feet of snow in a driveway that was 60 feet long once and I thought I was gonna die.
2091,"With the aging boomer demographic, if your parents live in snowy weather, try to convince them to buy a snowblower or hire someone.

My chiropractor died while shovelling.

I was convinced it was going to happen to me too, so I moved someplace warm"
2092,"Yes. Especially why you shouldn't let elderly people do it. Shovelling snow is known as a static exercise because it requires instant full use of your circulatory system. In older people this means your heart that is probably working slower than necessary for this type of thing, is put to full throttle, it will try to accommodate the demand from your muscles and as a result can lead to a heart attack because of being over worked."
2093,That's why I got a snowblower but I'm still risking it.
2094,Shovel type also plays a role in this
2095,I almost gave myself a heart attack chopping wood. Holy shit it was scary. I had to walk around to decompress. Exercise daily people.
2096,Figured out that the repeated 'seizing' core compression that you do to lift snow is a huge part of why this is.
2097,Like cutting grass in Florida during the summer. Our emergency departments fill up
2098,This is true. What's funny is all other admissions go way down because people  stay home.
2099,"After you have a heart attack, standard discharge instructions used to include no more shoveling snow or changing a car tire on your own."
2100,"I learned that this is how my great grandfather died. I had a heart attack myself last February at 39. I wasn't shoveling snow at the time, but I was doing it every other day since it was winter. My wife is convinced this is what will kill me, so we started hiring others to do it now. Just not worth the risk. Freaking snow is 3 ft deep in my yard now, I hate living where it's so cold it doesn't melt from Nov-May, just piles on, and on, and on each time."
2101,"I heard you can be fined for not shoveling snow. That seems a bit crazy to me. It falls from the sky, why should I have to shovel it?"
2102,Up here they call it ‚Äúheart attack snow‚Äù
2103,"Can confirm.  Been a paramedic since 2007 in northern Illinois. Definitely a thing we refer to as 'heart attack snow'. Typically it's the super wet, almost slush stuff."
2104,"That's how my grandpa went, and my dad lived through his.  


One of the many reasons I don't bother shoveling."
2105,Also strokes. It‚Äôs very  bi physically demanding work. I think people don‚Äôt realize how heavy snow can get.
2106,I finally bought a small snowblower last winter to not have to deal with shoveling anymore.  Don‚Äôt know how I lived in the upper Midwest without one.
2107,And that's why you move to Florida when you get old.
2108,As a Texan I have no idea what snow shoveling is like? Is it as common as mowing your lawn? Is it just part of life?
2109,Well big fat Americans and physical exertion are a bad combination.
2110,"Confirmed, we live in a snowy place, and wife works in the hospital.  Also, when we are getting lots of rain after having a snow build up, there are always incidents related to people falling off roofs they are shoveling."
2111,"Happened to a buddy's concierge a few weeks ago. Basically the caretaker for his apartment building he was renting out was a 94 year old dude he had in there for a few years.

&#x200B;

One day on a particularly heavy and wet snowfall, the guy shoveled himself to death in front of the whole building. Not sad really, dying at 94 of a heart attack is way better than dementia or other old people illness like that."
2112,"Boiled down: 

Older people who barely (or rarely) exercise, are more susceptible to heart attacks. Shoveling deep snow is essentially exercise."
2113,"Cardiac Season starts around fall, when summer coach potatoes have to start raking leaves until the last of the major snowfalls. Great overtime for nurses!"
2114,"People get old and stop exercising. Don't become a lump, stay active"
2115,Damn that sucks this is my number one dance move
2116,I wanna die in the summer
2117,This has to be partially linked to the fact that obesity and lack of exercise and cheese addiction is common in the  mid-west and then snow hits and you gotta start heaving shit for an hour. Surprised more of my neighbors aren't turning up now that you mention it.
2118,"It's like if you have a terrible diet and don't work out, a sudden bout of vigorous exercise in extreme weather is a bad idea. WEEEEEEEEEEEEIRD!"
2119,This explains everything...
2120,This is how my great grandad died in Canada.
2121,I'd be totally fine with this. Days I get to shovel are great days. Goodness I like shoveling snow.
2122,Can confirm. That's how my grampy died.
2123,There's also an increase in severed fingers during the winter months.
2124,It took my grandfather.
2125,because shoveling snow is hard ass work! duh
2126,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeb5LdAyLC8
2127,But why
2128,Wow...are there other known triggers? I'd like really like to know
2129,"Canada be like:
üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ"
2130,This is why exercise is important.....
2131,HAPPY FRIGGIN CAKE DAY YOU BEAUTIFUL HUMAN
2132,snow: the silent killer.
2133,Don‚Äôt let my dad see this so he has an excuse to make me shovel snow
2134,">I'd rather rot in the ground

-Your body, when you start shoveling snow"
2135,Two of my relatives died from this.
2136,Could someone tell me the reasons why shoveling snow can make a person have a heart attack? I was born and raised California and am genuinely curious! I've never heard about this before.
2137,"The 30+ years of the cheeseburgers beforehand were not held accountable 

Big Mac is smiling all the way to the bank."
2138,Who else thought shoving snow was a metaphor for coke?
2139,"When my mother and aunt were children, their father had a heart attack while shoveling after a large storm"
2140,"I'll add this in the list of ""shit I'm glad I don't have to worry about"" as a Californian"
2141,"What is it about shoveling snow that affects people? I took shoveling as a rather normal experience so long as one doesn't over exert themselves like any other exercise. 

I'm guessing theres more to it than that though, huh?"
2142,Whats even funnier is the BOTH the American Heart and Diabetes associations recommend shoveling snow as a way to stay active during the winter months.
2143,"My grandma'sdied from a heart attack while shoveling snow.. She was watching tv and outa yhe corner of her eye out the window she saw him faceplant.. He was dead b4 the ambulance came

The guy was in his early 60s, super good health as far as i knew.. He ran a ton and looked in super good physical shape.. His wife was a smoke show n his daughter is even better looking... And his daughters a doctor.. Full package"
2144,I think part of it is due to breathing in freezing air while exerting yourself.
2145,"Consider that today's people in general aren't used to manual labor. 

Then have them do possibly several hours worth of heavy manual labor at a drop of a hat... It's surefire way to kill off some people with more questionable life choices."
2146,Got a hernia shovelling snow a few years back. Can confirm snow shovelling bad for your health.
2147,"LPT:  while its snowing, get out there and shovel every couple hours.  It's a lot easier than waiting and having to shovel 3 feet of snow."
2148," I once worked with a fellow who was with the company for nearly 40 years. Company decides to buy out all the field techs and he gets offered a package of over $200k. He decides to take it and retire a couple years early. 

That weekend he had a heart attack shoveling snow and died. Fuck life and it's cruel twists of fate sometimes."
2149,"It's not the shoveling snow, it's the novel physical exertion that unfit individuals aren't used to."
2150,"Well, now I'm looking forward to the next blizzard."
2151,"I figured it was because of the sudden intense physical activity, but I was surprised that snowblowers also were bad for it."
2152,"Soon they will sell robots that will shovel snow.
Or tools that work electrically."
2153,"That's crazy. My grandpa died of a heart attack after shoveling snow. Shoveled the drive, laid down on the couch and died."
2154,"Given, I have a fractured spine, but the first time I threw out my back was shoveling snow when I was 15ish. Evil, evil activity health wise"
2155,I wonder if most of the senate doesn't have special business underwearables.  One less thing to worry their tiny hearts about.
2156,"Trust me; of all the ways to die, face down in a winter snow bank is not the worst. When I was a younger man, I used to think it would be terrible. 

Now, having seen how time wilts and withers people, how cancer chews up bodies, how dementia wears down families, a simple cardiac arrest isn‚Äôt so bad."
2157,"Ironically, the more and more frequently you shovel snow, the fitter and less-likely you will be to die of cardiovascular disease."
2158,"My uncle went out and shoved his driveway back about 7 years ago in Indiana. Came inside and sat down in his recliner afterwords. Aunt found him there a few hours later. The man walked around his neighbor most days, was fairly healthy. Just kicked it after a shoveling."
2159,My uncle died 2 weeks ago.  Same thing.  Widow-maker they called it; he was dead before he hit the ground
2160,Sorry that happened to you. First thing I did when I bought a house is buy a snow blower. Shovelling is the epitome of wasted effort. So much work for a temporary solution to a temporary problem. The fact that I can fully snow blow my property in less than an hour without breaking a sweat is super worth the money.
2161,"Shoveling is especially dangerous, because of the increase of the hearts afterload. This study says that snowfall in general is a risk for heart issues. Maybe because of altered air pressure or humidity"
2162,"Yeah, but his wife is now single so ..."
2163,What did he say
2164,"Maybe if you weren't such a cheap ass and got a snowblower earlier, your neighbor would still be alive today.  Good job, murderer."
2165,Oh snap i just commented.. Basicslly the same thing happened 2 my grandmas neighbor!
2166,It‚Äôs because this is the extent of a lot of Americans  physical activity for the year.
2167,"I had a coworker a few years ago collapse in her driveway of a heart attack while shoveling. The heart attack didn't kill her, but nobody was around to help.

She froze to death in her driveway and was found the next morning. 

Everyone was rattled for weeks."
2168,Sorry man :( that's really sad.
2169,You‚Äôre a good man.
2170,It's also often the only physical exercise a person has done since last winter.
2171,"I had a coworker who specializes in safety and work related injury tell me that a lot of it‚Äôs related to dehydration and overheating as well.  Often we think overheating and dehydration only happen in the heat of summer, but if your bundled up and working hard, it‚Äôs easy to over exert yourself quickly.  Be sure to dress in layers and start ‚Äúpeeling‚Äù as soon as you begin warming up.  Better to feel a little nippy than start sweating in the cold."
2172,"Me shovelling snow is basically 5 minutes of shovelling, go in and get my inhalor and take a 20 minute break......go do another 5 minutes of shovelling, and so on.  My only complaint about that is that the asthma symptoms would probably mask any heart attack symptoms (I'm female)."
2173,It also doesnt help that cortisal (stress hormone) levels are their highest when you wake up. The reason most heart attacks happen in the morning.
2174,"Huh, I wonder if that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so much harder to run in the winter?"
2175,I believe you should have read the article.
2176,There's actually a reflex where coronary arteries will constrict in some older people when the face is exposed to intense cold.
2177,A slight amount of physical exercise in non ideal conditions
2178,"I don't think it's the blood pressure.  Sudden rises in blood pressure can cause a stroke, and chronically elevated blood pressure is bad for the heart.  

It's the heart rate.  Your heart gets blood in between heart beats.  For 99.9% of us, a heart rate of 150 is fine for a finite period of time.  For those of us that are near death due to cardiac disease, the slow down in coronary flow can trigger a massive clot and sudden cardiac death"
2179,"Also, the cold can cause blood to thicken in certain individuals; this can lead to stoke and/or heart attack."
2180,Last snowstorm I took care of 3 NSTEMIs just myself.
2181,Are these mostly over weight people?
2182,"My great grandfather died similarly.  Shoveled, went inside, knelt by his bedside (not sure why or if it was done on purpose) and died there.

He was a religious man so they think he knelt down to pray."
2183,"I'm glad my grandparents live someplace without snow. My grandpa has had multiple heart attacks, and one time drove himself to the hospital. If he were out shoveling, he'd probably finish even if he felt the chest pain early on."
2184,The number of times I‚Äôve considered building a flamethrower after moving to New England....
2185,as a person who doesn't live with snow. Why is it needed to shovel so often? Just moving things out of the way should be done right?
2186,"Thanks, I am going to call snow 'white bullshit' from now on."
2187,"40+? That's not THAT old, son."
2188,If you can find somebody reliable. My cousin is almost 70 and has RA. She usually has to do her own shoveling.
2189,"I try to alleviate stress by swearing the entire time. 

That gets rewarded by falling on my ass. 

Then if I've managed to get my driveway almost finished, the plow truck will certainly be through and push 4,000lbs of hard slush filled with rocks over the last 2 feet.

Wonderful."
2190,"I have a long sidewalk on a corner lot, which absolutely *no one* ever walks on. But I'm still required to shovel it... So fun."
2191,Nothing says fuck you than seeing the plow come by for a third time long after the storm to wing the already plowed and shoveled road back yet again. Shoveling small glaciers with a plastic shovel for seemingly no reason makes the ole blood boil
2192,We avoid it by not removing snow. We groom it and travel around on snowmobiles. I just have to cut steps from my front door up to the driveway where everything is groomed and packed. I can literally ski from my driveway.
2193,"Why do you need to shovel it three times a day? I haven't actually lived in significant snow so I don't understand. Shovel how much? Like just around your door, around the car?"
2194,"Speaking from the UK, Ive only seen that much snow around 2-3 days in the last 20 years and if we get even half of that much, the entire country shuts down anyway so you have nowhere to be"
2195,So your flesh will still be fresh for the local cannibal community?
2196,"> Does it take longer? You bet.

That's the problem, you're freezing your ass off and you just want to get it over with."
2197,The shoveling doesn‚Äôt cause heart issues. The stress of shoveling can exacerbate an issue already present such as coronary artery stenosis which then can turn into Acute coronary syndrome
2198,Have you been assessed for epilepsy?
2199,"My sister has epilepsy and it sounds like you're describing seizures. What you call ""grey outs"" sound like a petit mal seizure. You should read about those and see if the symptoms match what you experience(d)."
2200,"Not a doctor, but I‚Äôm a medical student. You could be suffering from something like absence seizures. It‚Äôs caused by abnormal and intense sudden electrical impulses in the brain. They‚Äôre more common in children, but have been known to occur in adults too. I saw that a previous comment mentioned getting an EEG done. Maybe look into that? 

A differential diagnosis might also be cataplexy, which is a sudden episode of muscle weakness that is often triggered by strong emotions. It‚Äôs often associated with narcolepsy."
2201,"obligatory not a doctor, but it could be orthostatic hypotension.

I get that sometimes when I stand up. I go completely blind for about 3-5 seconds and then my vision comes back and I'm good. Personally I've never gotten the dizziness or fallen over, but those are also common symptoms.  


However, if it's more like you ""forget"" how to stand and then fall over versus just losing ""control"" and falling over, that would suggest something neurological instead."
2202,Atrial fibrillation.  Get a holter monitor for 30 days.
2203,"My brother had a period of this in his late teens, when he was a student. The eventual diagnosis was some kind of seizures. He was told to take better care of himself (as a student he lived on beer and cornflakes and minimal sleep), was put on a low dose of something for life, and as far as I know has been fine ever since."
2204,My grandmother went through the same exact thing. Doctors ran a bunch of tests. Couldn't find anything.
2205,"Not a doctor, just spitballing. How is your blood sugar?"
2206,Epilepsy. You NEED to get an EEG.
2207,Not a doctor but my first thought is your brain not your heart.
2208,"Same. Bought my dad a snowblower for peace of mind! My dad could easily afford one, but he is too stubborn to get one himself. One of the best purchases I‚Äôve made."
2209,This is the right answer.
2210,"Probably a combination of the age and fitness of people who shovel snow, the cold weather making it harder to tell you're overworking, and your heart/lungs doing overtime. You're moving really slow so you might feel you aren't working that hard until PLOP."
2211,Mine too!
2212,Daylight savings time.
2213,Throwing it over the shoulder sounds awful! Just lift it enough off the ground so you can place it somewhere else!
2214,"I resisted a getting a snowblower until last February when the upper midwest got a huge storm while I was out of town, and my wife had to shovel our house out. We bought a snowblower the next weekend."
2215,"I never thought I had to move much, when you're young you have natural energy. Now I'm 36, average build, but unhealthy af. Room temperature can make me sweat. Any physical activity leaves me out of breath, I have to sit in front of a fan and cool down after getting dressed in the morning for work. Sometimes it feels like my arteries are blocked and can't get enough blood through. I keep wanting to start doing some exercise again, but I don't wanna have a heart attack :(  Don't drink, people."
2216,Cheese addiction? Not the entire Midwest. Only Wisconsin.
2217,"Vegas checking in over here, what's snow?"
2218,"My grandpa went on a 5 day fishing trip with all the boys in the family. They drank, fished and played poker the whole time. When he got home he was on the phone with his life long friend when he had a massive heart attack and that was it. 

I think he had the best last days and would gladly go the same way!"
2219,"Yep. The dead-before-you-hit-the-ground scenario seems fine to me. I‚Äôve got heart disease, cancer and dementia in the family. I‚Äôve seen all three take people out. Heart attack seems by far the most merciful, even if the suddenness can be hard to deal with for those left behind. The withering grind to death and loss of self is not better."
2220,This whole thread is making me sad. My dad was perfectly healthy at 62 his whole life. Just got hit with a crazy cancer diagnosis in November and things are not going well. Still hasn't been able to start chemo yet.
2221,"My grandmother passed today after a decade long battle with Parkinson's, and was in a coma for the last 10 days where every morning they gave her 24 hours to live. When my dad called he told me that this shouldnt all be bad because it was her time, and she isnt in pain anymore. She was a shell of her former self for the past year or so."
2222,"I work in medical. I agree. I'd love to go out in my 50s just doing some good hard exercise, feeling like I'm getting shit done.."
2223,I feel different about that and you would as well if you ever have a heart attack.
2224,Fuck dementia is all I got to say...
2225,"Might be a bitch for a second is so but, yeah overall pretty peaceful. No gore, just dead."
2226,I‚Äôm all about avoiding the diaper-applesauce years.
2227,"Dying of cardiac arrest while shoveling snow in the crisp winter morning sounds like one of the best ways to die...I‚Äôve seen and smelled too many nursing homes, too many people in hospice."
2228,"Thank you ... I'm 62 and live in New Brunswick Canada (we immigrated here 14 years ago from a southern US state).

I clean my own driveway, sidewalks and deck after every snowstorm, and I look forward to shoveling snow every winter.

Quite honestly, I'm pretty sick of hearing the advice (if well-meaning) of those who tell me that a snow-shovel is a ""widow-maker"".

And if they find me dead of a massive coronary later this morning (we got about 10cm last night); hey ... I'm ok with that.  I don't want to go out like my Dad.  Oh, wait, he's still living, at 87, with Alzheimer's, in a nursing facility.  Nope. Won't die like that.

Photos I took this morning:

2229,Jesus
2230,"When you put it like that, it seems like a good way to go, if any way can be called good.

Time does kill everything, probably even itself someday. Even if we achieve immortality, it will never truly be permanent."
2231,"sadly, seasons are... seasonal."
2232,"My granddad was shoveling snow and after going to bed, told the lady he lived with that he wasn't managing to sleep, but it was alright, because he figured he'd manage to get some sleep the next day. Well... He never woke up, so I guess he did."
2233,That might have been during the year Purdue got fined for not calling off class when it was -35 with windchill
2234,I mean... I kinda like the workout. But I'm just outdoorsy.
2235,"I have a really short driveway, it takes me about 20 minutes to clear it."
2236,Sheeeesh
2237,I also choose this guy's single wife.
2238,/r/JesusChristreddit
2239,I also choose the dead guy's wife.
2240,Honestly we were both bitching about the weather. Was one of the rare mid-Atlantic storms we get every couple years. Maybe a 5 minute conversation and he collapsed about 5 minutes after.
2241,"Ain't gonna lie, even I laughed at this one."
2242,"On the one hand, you‚Äôre an ass hole because this is obviously still affecting /u/JimmyDrums86. On the other hand, you‚Äôre an even bigger ass hole for making me laugh and making me an ass hole too."
2243,"I lol'd

I hope the person that you're responding to sees the humor in this. It's exactly the kind of thing some asshats would say in sincerity."
2244,TIL this is a humorless sub
2245,Snowblowers are fun to use too.
2246,And they usually need to get it done quickly so they push themselves.
2247,"You may be half joking but... I definitely believe many of us live very sedentary lives with only a few events per year or month where we can suddenly massively overexert ourselves. 

Helping a friend move, having to rush up the stairs because the elevator is out, jogging to your airport gate so you don't miss your flight, your kids are finally asleep after screaming for 6 hours straight and your wife gives you an inviting wink, etc.

Shoveling snow is unique out of all of those however, since it is a perfectly deadly combination of an acute burst of exercise, zero/little warm-up, and no opportunities to take breaks. 

If you are helping your friend move no one would bat an eye if you took a 2 minute water break to catch your breath. But when you are shoveling, there's a good chance you are scared of being late to work, still half asleep, pissed that you have to shovel (and therefore less conscious of your safety), and hurriedly lifting hundreds of pounds of water on a big lever arm. 

Yeah that's heart attack city."
2248,"I do regular weightlifting and maintain a healthy weight and shoveling a driveway can *still* be a fairly intensive workout. I don't know how otherwise sedentary people get through it. The heart attack statistic doesn't surprise me, that's for sure."
2249,"That, combined with poor diet."
2250,This
2251,"I know someone who physical rehab and training, literally worked out all day for a living, who needed five stents (3 on the right and 2 on the left) after shoveling snow."
2252,"I'm guessing that's the biggest reason. If it snows a lot, you *have* to do physical activity. Even if you have a snowblower you have to go dig it out and walk around a lot. That's more than a lot of people ever really do."
2253,"Heat is also a good indicator, but is held at bay by the cold."
2254,"Seriously, shoveling is a workout. I usually end up in a t-shirt."
2255,"Also, don't go jogging with a jacket in the middle of the summer. You will not sweat your fat and get thin, that's not how it works. But if you want to die of a heatstroke, then go ahead. I'm not judging."
2256,"I've spent my whole life in cold snowy areas. My LPT on this is to dress cold when you go to shovel, a zip-up sweatshirt should be enough. Don't wear your thick coat, don't put on a bunch of layers.

Most of the time when you have a large snowfall it's not going to be very cold. Maybe at freezing or 10 degrees below it at worst. Sometimes there's oddities where it's pretty frigid in the morning after a large dump.. but not most of the time.

Sure you'll be cold to start with, but you'll warm up pretty quickly. You'll especially be thankful when you don't have to start taking layers off and you're sweatyness makes you cold again because of the moisture in your clothes..."
2257,"Just curious, why would it matter that you're female?

Edit : I see! That's interesting, thank you for enlightening me"
2258,The article mentions the formation of clots caused by high blood pressure but fails to mention other factors. The reason people in cardio rehab are forbidden from lifting above waist or chest height is arm exercises place tremendous strain on the heart. Significantly more strain than running on the treadmill because the heart must overcome gravity and pump blood higher than the heart itself. This coupled with changes in cold weather breathing patterns can dramatically increase blood pressure.
2259,"Nah he's right, that definitely is a big part of it.  

Source:  my cardiologist."
2260,Forgive my ignorance but would a high sustained heart rate combined with poor EF produce conditions similar to A-FIB and this is why clotting is such a risk?
2261,"The patients in question have all sorts of body types, although yes, generally overweight to obese (but not really morbidly obese). In my personal experience, the more common factors amongst them, though, are age (usually 50+ years old) and smoking cigarettes (past or current). Secondary to those, probably family history of cardiac disease. In young people (i.e. younger than 40 years old), there's usually a genetic component or drug abuse.

Seriously, though, just don't smoke. The vast majority of my cardiac patients are smokers or have smoked heavily in the past (yes, even those with normal BMIs and otherwise healthy lifestyles) and it's rare for me to have a cardiac patient who has never smoked. [According to The Heart and Stroke Foundation](https://www.heartandstroke.ca/-/media/pdf-files/canada/other/just-breathe-become-smoke-free-en.ashx), smokers are 3 times more likely to die of cardiac disease than non-smokers, and that increases to 4-8 times if said smoker has high blood pressure and/or high cholesterol (which is probably the majority of older people). That's not even going into the lung diseases you can get from smoking. Cigarettes are horrible. If anyone reading this smokes, please look into quitting!"
2262,"Upvoted you because your question can be offensive but its honest, and It was hidden for me at first, meaning that someone downvoted it, while it's a genuinely normal question"
2263,Flamethrowers are legal. You can buy one.
2264,"It's like raking leaves. You move snow, wind blows it back to where you just shoveled. Sometimes it comes down when the temperature is right around freezing and it's waterlogged, becomes heavy as fuck. Also, snowplows have a tendency to go by after you've finished and pile a bunch of snow back where you just shoveled.

On top of all of that, sometimes it just snows all day. I'd rather shovel a few times while it's not very deep (less weight too!) than have to shovel three feet of snow in the 10 minutes before I need to leave for work."
2265,"You don't need to be THAT old to be THAT out of shape.

And I'm getting to the age where I think twice about whether it's a heart attack or indigestion, gramps."
2266,A 31 year old i knew died shoveling.  Wasnt in bad shape either
2267,old enough though
2268,"My grandfather died in his early 40‚Äôs from a heart attack. 


From everything I heard, he was active and healthy."
2269,I know multiple people under 40 that have active jobs including lifting and moving for 8+ hours a day that had cardiac events. Take care of yourself.
2270,"This is why I don't think I would survive in the North, as much as I hate the South. That, and I call people ""honey"" and ""dear"" ."
2271,My car is at the end of a dead end shared driveway. Guess where all the snow gets plowed every morning before I go off to school?
2272,Sometimes you just don't want to deal with 4 billion tons of white bullshit.
2273,Required?  By whom?
2274,"Shovel the entire driveway and the walkway. 

Not to mention clear any cars in the driveway. 

Multiple times because if it‚Äôs a heavy snowfall it‚Äôs preferable (for some, most?) to shovel lighter loads rather than try to clear a path through 28 inches."
2275,"Like, because it hasn't stopped snowing. And waiting for it to stop and then shoveling? You're gonna have a bad time."
2276,"It often snows for days, if you don't keep on top of it it becomes a huge problem really quickly during heavy snowfall. You won't be able to get your car our. Plus if you get it as close to concrete as you can the sun will melt some of the ice that forms if/when it heats up.

If you walk on snow before you shovel It, or drive on it. It's creates patches of compacted snow that are hard or impossible to get up. Those patches become ice.

TLDR: snow is a pain in the ass"
2277,Otherwise its too deep to shovel after a while. You have to keep up with the pace of the storm.
2278,"I usually just let it all fall, but still have to clear it all. If you drive on snow a bunch it packs down into basically ice. Do this for a few snow falls and you driveway will be higher then the plowed road. Not to mention walking on that uneven, bumpy, and icey driveway for 3 months sounds terrible"
2279,"Not only more snow falling but also the damn plow... You get ten inches of snow with eight more coming? Cool. That plow comes through and leaves you with a rock hard four foot high three feet wide mountain of ice and snow at the end of your driveway locking you and your car in. 


And after you chip through that shit here the plow comes again from a slightly different angle. 


And then there is more snow. Repeat."
2280,"It‚Äôs actually best to reduce the body temperature immediately after a MI to protect the body, or so I‚Äôve heard."
2281,"> That's the problem, you're freezing your ass off 

for the first 2-3 minutes. Once you start shoveling, you will start to get warm quite fast."
2282,"And the leading cause of said stenosis? American diet. (causing hypertension, high LDL cholesterol, obesity which are all big risk factors)"
2283,No? No one mentioned seizures or epilepsy. What does assessment involve?
2284,"I was tested for that, nope."
2285,So no POTS...good luck figuring it out
2286,"Had one, nothing out of the ordinary."
2287,I get migraines behind my left eye. They did an MRI but found nothing.
2288,"You should come have a talk with my husband. I've been begging for a snowblower for about 10 years now. He refuses to shovel so that just leaves yours truly. Oh, and we have a corner lot. Fun fun. Soon as we can afford it, I might hire someone."
2289,Last January I just got tired of paying the neighborhood kids to do it.
2290,You should see a doctor about that if you haven't already.
2291,"DDPY, brother"
2292,"My great grandma died in her sleep aged 103. She was in her own home in her own bed. She was independent for her whole life and spent that day as she always did, normal routine, time in the garden, gin and tonic in the evening, then to bed and gone. I can't really think of a better way to go."
2293,"My granddad died of a heart attack at the veteran's club, with a beer in his hand, surrounded by all his war buddies. It's sad because he wasn't very old (early 70s I think), but looking back I'm sure if he had to choose a way to go, it would be exactly that."
2294,"My grandma was in a retirement home when she went. We had been in town for the week and spent time with her, taken her to all of her favorite places, and it had been great. 
The next day they said she woke up, rolled to breakfast in her wheelchair, and then as she left the dining room she passed away and just drifted off, rolling down the hallway. 

It seemed lovely and fitting. I would do it like that if I could. A great holiday with everyone I loved, then time for one last good meal, and I‚Äôm ready to drift off into peace."
2295,"That‚Äôs beautiful. He had an awesome time with his friends, then went out while talking to his best friend."
2296,I can only hope this is me.
2297,"If it a ""heart attack and your  dead"" scenario, maybe.

My grandpa had several heart attacks in his life, eventually dying of the long term consequences of these 20 years later."
2298,"That's the thing though. Healthy people never get checked up and only go when they have problems. And by then it's too late. 

My mom is super weak and sick all the time so shes constantly getting checked up. My dad is like yours. Really healthy, never gets sick, never gets checked up. Turns out he had high blood pressure though... so gotta watch out. 

Hope your dad makes it through"
2299,"My 90 yo grandma still alive . Jas dementia for years now. She is a shade of her childhood self right now. Luckily she was kind oerson then and she is kind now, still however her caretakers are exchausted."
2300,"In yours 50s? Man come on! That means I'm already halfway through life with that expectancy.  We can stay healthy and happy until at least 70. Come on, do it with me!"
2301,"For me, long enough not to see my kids die. I'll suffer any death if I could guarantee that."
2302,"> feeling like I'm getting shit done..

No, that was how Elvis went out."
2303,How old are you now?
2304,I had a panic attack that caused my heart to hit >130 beats per minute and that shit suuuuucked. So a heart attack sounds like something I never want to do.
2305,"I've had a heart attack, and I'd have ten more and die on the last one before I'd let dementia slowly erode me to nothing. Everyone dies, and from what I've seen, it's best to do it all at once."
2306,New gym idea: Snow shoveling machine.
2307,I think his point is that he stopped shoveling and bought a snowblower out of fear. Which is only making it more likely for him to have a heart attack. Because you cant avoid an increase in blood pressure your entire life.
2308,"Man, I wish I lived somewhere that shut down during snow and/or cold related events. 

The windchill tomorrow morning is supposed to be around -40 and I can hear the wind howling outside as the cold front moves in. The best we get is maybe a bit of a slow day depending on the business, usually because shipping stops long before the city itself does."
2309,I like the workout and I find it kind of relaxing.  I spend all day making decisions so it's kind of therapeutic to just do a mindless task for a while.
2310,Yup that dude sounds soft.
2311,"Hey eating can cause death by strangulation, let's just stop eating and avoid it altogether! I guess giving up exercise is the proper way to avoid heart problems these days. Guess they will be giving up sex too."
2312,"I'm just saying, why plow only the driveway?"
2313,Man I hope my last words are wild. Fukkn weather
2314,"Thanks, guy.  Levity is always good."
2315,"You thought that the snow death was a cold case and admitted your crime ten years later, but we finally got you, sucka, you're going to prison, Greg."
2316,Dark humor is best humor.
2317,he did. and it was great.
2318,And sometimes your wife or neighbors are watching and you want to look capable and strong.
2319,"And since we‚Äôve done it before, pretty much Every year we see no danger.  I‚Äôm 50 now and I consider shoveling the snow to be a dangerous activity that requires planning and rest periods.  It‚Äôs the rush to finish that gets people I assume."
2320,"They're not really joking at all.

70% of Americans are overweight or obese, with more than half of that group obese. They didn't get that way all while exercising 3x a week. Its because most people do absolutely zero physical activity.

So little that when they actually do some, it kills them."
2321,"I live in a snowy area. We often stretch before shoveling, take breaks, pace ourselves, quit half way through and come back later. It can be good exercise if you approach it properly. Sure you may be late for work but when there is 30cm of new snow everybody is going to be late, including the boss, it‚Äôs accepted."
2322,This idea is what made me wanna be more fit. I wasn‚Äôt obese but defintley overweight and out of shape. Started BJJ and it made a world of difference.
2323,Lmaoooo ain't no inviting winks after the kids 6 hour crying sesh
2324,"This is why, if shit hit the fan and society crumbled, most people would die just from needing to be more active."
2325,"I bet you do it a lot faster than sedentary people.

I noticed with running it doesn't really get easier, you just become faster."
2326,I'd wager most folks that are out of shape hold their breath when they exert themselves. That tends to increase heart rate which could lead to a heart attack.
2327,"I have recently become an expert at clearing snow from my drive way. 1 push down the center, then work each side separately  pushing only half a shovels width towards the grass."
2328,Girl is on fiiirrrreeeer
2329,"Same here, usually i wear a heavy coat.  After 10 minutes, i throw it back indoors, it ends up feeling like summer while I'm shoveling."
2330,It feels like you're judging tho
2331,Females tend to have atypical symptoms with a heart attack- less so the classic crushing chest pain radiating down the left arm. So she might have symptoms that feel more like an asthma attack which would go unnoticed.
2332,>Women are more likely to have [nontraditional symptoms](https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/heart-disease/heart-attack-and-women/heart-attack-symptoms) of heart attack than men. And women are also more likely to have silent heart attacks.
2333,"Women have different heart attack symptoms than men. Google says for women, shortness of breath is one, which might be mistaken for asthma?"
2334,Different heart attack symptoms for women.  Generally speaking it's not as obvious as the symptoms for men and tend to mimic other aches and pains that are common to middle age.
2335,The symptoms for a heart attack tend to be different for females.
2336,"I think height is sort of a correlation but not causation. Reality is that when you start exercising (regardless of what exercise it is) your whole body will go into ""exercise mode"", which brings vasoconstriction across the whole body. The exception to that is in the local areas of the worked muscle, where a few byproducts will be produced and secreted by the working muscles to induce vasodilation in its local area. While this vasodilation is done primarily to make sure that the working muscle gets all blood it needs, a secondary outcome is a drop in BP. Thus, greater the muscle used greater the drop in BP. This difference is most notable when comparing BP during arm vs. leg workouts; legs are huge and thus the vasodilation they cause makes a huge difference in BP (opposite is true for arms & BP)

Shoveling snow is always underestimated as an exercise but it's far from trivial and most people will prioritize their arms and not utilize their legs, thus causing this huge, prolonged and often deadly spike in BP.

TLDR if you have heart problems and have to shovel some snow take it slow and use your legs"
2337,"Okay, fair enough, the article did mention the cold weather part, but did not mention the raising above the chest part.

E: Thanks for the downvote, I love being kicked after I've admitted that I was wrong and the other person made a good point. Reddit doesn't need more of that üòâ"
2338,"Hmm, just spitballing here, but cardio rehab suggests you work with people who've already got CHF or a previous MI or something? In those populations I wouldn't be surprised if something like lifting your arms above your head causes some drastic changes in blood pressure, because their hearts already aren't working that well and are unable to compensate all the extra fluid, but I'm curious if it'd really be all that significant at all in someone with a healthy cardiovascular system. Sorta like how if a 20 year old stands up too quickly after a long time they might feel a little woozy for a second, but an 80 year old patient might literally pass out."

2346,"Like to maintain a minimum level of clearance in key areas?

I didn't think that people waited till it stopped snowing necessarily because I know sometimes the snow can last all winter. But not having dealt with snow before, I somehow imagined it was like a once a day thing, like you clear out for the morning and then yeah some more accumulates thru the day, but you are still able to get in your house after you get home from work? 

What do you do when you have to work and can't be there to do it in the day? Do you just have to dig your way back in your house?

2350,"hmm. and you were checked for strokes too? Just saw you said you also slump over and slur mid-convo and that sounds a lot like someone having a stroke.

Maybe transient ischemic attack? They're like mini-strokes that don't cause lasting damage and can often go undetected because of that.

It's possible you have normal blood pressure when you're not physically active and then when you get to moving (like shoveling or rocking out at a concert) your pressure spikes and you have a TIA.

No idea."

2373,Man of course it sucked. You had an anxiety attack. Possibly the worst feeling is an anxiety attack. Pure loss of hope. Total despair. That emotional feeling had nothing to do with how an actual heart attack feels like
2374,"Lol I used to have PSVT where my heart rate would hit 200+ (I never found out what my max actually was, my pulse oximeter maxed out at 200 but theyd have to stop my heart with a 12cc injection of adenosine and it usually took 2 tries to reset it). Shit sucks"

Everything else seems right to me, take breaks when you are at good stopping points, don't stress about work because it's expected, etc. I actually love shoveling and snowblowing. It is so peaceful outside with all of the snow and I like the chill when I get too hot from the exercise. There's also nothing more satisfying than seeing the results at the end."

I've noticed it being both easier and faster for me than when I was mildly overweight and out of shape though. I find the athleticism and overall quality of life difference is significantly greater than people think, except for those who have seen both sides of the coin.

2394,"It is sad that for 50% of the population, heart attack symptoms are considered non traditional."
2395,I wonder what percentage of heart attacks caused by snow shoveling are true heart attacks (STEMI) or Cardiac arrests induced by tachycardia? I'm curious why some individuals can have almost complete blockages and only experience symptoms of sweating and fatigue on exertion while others with only partial blockages can experience a significant MI.

2404,"I think the increased and prolonged exertion associated with clearing the larger volume at one time is potentially more dangerous. 
Neither multiple clearings you get a break in between. Plus with a thinner layer you can shove more snow versus doing more lifting when it accumulates."
2405,"Depends on the type of snow.  Light, fuffy snow, one time is fine.  Wet, heavy snow, as often as you can manage."
2406,Nah. Go out every few hours and you can just plow it by walking with the shovel. Much less time spent and energy exerted than going out when you have a few feet of snow to shovel in one go. If your a smoker just give it a go when you smoke. Pop in your headphones and listen to a few songs.
2407,"It varies greatly from storm to storm. I am lucky that I am a teacher, so most times that we get significant snow, I get a day off and can just wait until it stops to clean up.

If there's a time when it's  storming and I have to go somewhere, it's basically clear out the front porch, then one scoop at a time down the walkway, and finally the driveway (including the mountain of snow at the end of the driveway the plow will leave). Go out and do what you gotta do knowing that when you get home, you get to do it in reverse order (park on the street, clear the driveway, park the car, hit the walkway, hit the porch, go in and get a warm shower)."
2408,"It snows the same way it rains. Not everyday and sometimes a little sometimes a lot.  

If it‚Äôs snowing at night some people like to shovel before going to bed in the hopes there‚Äôs not much to do in the morning.  If it snows while you‚Äôre at work you deal with it when you get home.   

The biggest problem is usually the plowman during a heavy snowfall.  Usually the plow clears residential streets well after everyone has shoveled and leaves a several foot high wall of heavy snow at the bottom of your driveway.  Most of the time that‚Äôs the real struggle."
2409,"Most of the time snow is manageable to shovel in the morning or sometimes before and after work. However, a few times a year (depending on where you live and how that winter is going) it just keeps coming down for like 3 days straight. And if you wait until the snow is done for the day, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time"
2410,"Something I havent seen mentioned yet is people will often shovel wet heavy snow because if you don't, and its heavy/wet enough during really cold temps, the snow will just turn into ice after a few hours, and then you are dealing with several inches of ice til the next thaw. It's pretty common where I am to see people up super early in am/late at night to shovel because of this."
2411,"Yes, you had to dig your way back into your house. 

You watch the weather carefully and they give your snowfall vs time of the storm. If you're lucky it snows a bit (1/3) before work and you shovel/blow your way out and hopefully the city and state have done so as well so you get to work. Then during the day the city and state keep the main roads open. If you are really lucky it snowed only about 1/3 during the day, so you can drive into your garage and blow again. And finally 1/3 over the next evening which you take care of the next morning.

But really heavy snowfalls rarely cooperate. I have had to dig my way out in the morning. Fight to get to work, fight to get home, and plow my driveway while my car is on the street, just to be able to get home (dig my way back in). 

One day in particular. I had to go offsite to a manufacturing location, and I was going to give a ride to a female co-worker. Snows heavily overnight. She gets stuck on the road toward my house so I go down and we push her through the snowbank and she gets to my house (I had plowed my long driveway already at 5 am). We drive through crazy conditions, semi's scattered in the ditches the whole way. The manufacturing run goes poorly so we drive home at 2 am. The city has cleared the road I live on leaving a huge snowbank at the entry to my driveway. So I walk to my house, get out my snowblower and clear it so I can drive in and she can drive home. Neighbor called the cops because of the snowblowing noise - the cops were very understanding (also I lived on 1 acre and not very close to them). This was a Friday. Reschedule the manufacturing run for Monday. What happens? Massive snowfall on Sunday night and we repeated the entire process."
2412,"Shoveling 3 inches 3 times is much easier than shoveling 9 inches once. I used to  live somewhere that got 200+ inches of snow a year. I would often times shovel before going to work, shovel when I got home from work so I didn't drive on the snow and pack it down, and then shovel before bed if it snowed a bunch so I had less to shovel in the morning."
2413,Winter days have huge ranges in temperature. It's easier to get snow when it has just fallen or when a warm afternoon loosens it up. If you ignore a big snowfall until the late evening or overnight it can partially melt and reharden into ice/slush and be much more work to shovel. If you drive onto a few inches of snow it can compact it into ice and then it's stuck as a slippery (or even dangerous) driveway until you get a warm afternoon (which could be days or weeks away).
2414,Tell that to the snow on my driveway.
2415,"As a Canadian, I could not agree more."
2416,"Hmm, wonder why this didn't come up. I strongly suspected it's because I'm a big girl (obese) they automatically assumed heart condition. I have a neurologist but he settled on ""migraine without aura"" which never explained it well enough."
2417,"It's weird because he's generally reasonable with everything else.  His arguments are that we can't afford one (I argue that you can find decent ones for sale all the time for comparatively cheap); we don't have room (true, but I bet I could move things around to make room if necessary; and we would only use it 2-3 times a year at the most (maybe, but when we need it; we really need it).  We tried to compromise with an electric snow shovel a couple of years ago, but that thing is only slightly better than useless.  

That's not to say he doesn't go out and dig us out when we get the real lulus that come through every once in awhile (by which I mean over 6""), but I'm still trying to wear him down."

2422,But you don't know you've fallen asleep?
2423,"I used to be off that mindset, and there is a part of me that does want to be aware while having a peaceful death, but the more I think on it, yeah, I want to be asleep. When I‚Äôm dead I won‚Äôt remember dying, so might as well go in the easiest way."

2429,"Shit like this is what I use to convince myself to binge a few times per year. My grandpa lived to 98 years old generally healthy, no dementia, no strokes, still have a respectable amount of hair, and no severe mobility problems (maybe a a sore back or knee some days), while drinking gin or brandy everyday, refuses to eat vegetables at all - only seafood and meat, and occasionally smoked (used to smoke heavily but quit when his children were born). And I see his peers who frown on his vices bent decrepit. The human body is an enigma."

2454,"Actually this used to be the case when more men smoked and drank more, but recently the numbers are more equal. Heart attack is the leading cause of death for both genders. Unfortunately for women, their symptoms can look more like other very common problems that isn't taken that seriously, and the pain can feel less acute, and so falls more often under 'I'll wait and see', which is why heart attacks are now more often fatal for women than men.

Medical research has also until recently been very male focused, as they kinda assumed women mostly worked as men did plus some extra bits and minus some others, and it was just so much easier to do research on men when you didn't have to concern yourself with periods and the ensuing hormonal fluctuations playing merry hell with your variables. It took a long time until they started to realize that gender could have a very big effect on how symptoms presented, and that it could affect how people reacted to medicine and treatment too. There is now a lot of catching up to do."

One of my grandmothers was completely with it until she went into a coma less than 24 hours before her passing. She had been miserable for more than 15 years with progressive kidney disease.

The other was fully lucid until about three days before she passed. Every poke and prod, us and her, until she measured time through every beer they wouldn't give her. It was dozens of beers until she finally died."

It leaves out the possibilities of other gods.  Once you start believing in a god just in case it's real, you start a slippery slope whereby that same logic you ought to believe in every god just in case it's real.

The real plus is that when it‚Äôs snowing heavy enough it muffled sound. So if your not ina a crowded place, and especially if your in a rural area, the world gets extremely, almost eerily quiet and the only thing you might hear is the crunch of snow beneath your feet. Plus everything gets coated a clean white snow coating which can be very pretty. Especially the morning after a storm clears and the light reflects of the glistening snow.

It's really not an extra expense because your summer tires are gonna last longer. They still try and argue that their AWD SUV or 4WD truck is just as good as my snow tires.

If the driving conditions are bad enough to necessitate AWD, then they're certainly bad enough that you should be buying the proper tires in addition to that.

For what it's worth, my often unplowed driveway runs up a halfway decently sloped (for this area) hill too. The only real issue I'm worried about is running out of ground clearance. I've been plowing a bit with the bumper, but so far we haven't ever gotten enough snow to stop me."

I‚Äôve speculated that among rapists and murderers released from prison because of DNA evidence that it‚Äôs possible in rare cases a human chimera would test to be innocent when in fact they are not.  This could occur if their genitalia had one set of DNA while their saliva glands had another.  Which by the way, has been proven to exist.  In one case a woman (Karen Keegan) was told her own baby did not belong to her after a DNA test.  When in fact it did.  This occurred because she had multiple sets of DNA in different parts of her body."

Inspiration for numerous fictions serial killers. Hannibal lector in a mask? That‚Äôs because Chikatilo had to be in a cage at trial (because he had killed so many people, it was actually for his protection)

This marks the beginning of forensic profiling.

And also it‚Äôs the pinnacle of dark comedy for how ridiculously easy getting away with murder must have been. He was an employee white male - no way he could have killed someone! Other people were interrogated, gave false confessions and were executed.

His entire life was a red flag. (Including being unable to have sex with his wife so they agreed that she‚Äôd just push his semen inside of her and that‚Äôs how they conceived, being fired for being inappropriate with the students, being seen with the first victim with bloody footprints from his home to the river where the body was found...)"

2938,It's not actually very uncommon! Many (if not most or all) people who have been pregnant become chimeras as a result of transporting blood and nutrients back and forth with the fetus. There are even cases where people will develop different skin patterns afterwards. People who have also experienced vanishing twin syndrome are considered chimeras as well. There's been a lot of really interesting research done on the topic.
2939,"There are human chimeras. Honestly they might not be that rare - usually one set of DNA dominates a system (ie reproductive) while the other set of DNA makes up the rest of it.

I know exactly the case you‚Äôre talking about. I feel like we watched the same documentary.

My main theory about human chimeras is that most transgendered people are actually chimeras with different DNA making up their reproductive system/brain.

I do believe the different blood type and semen type was actually explained by a different medical anomaly ‚Äúnonsecretor‚Äù"

‚ÄúA chimeric human, or human chimera, has two or more populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes.

Fuck you!"" He immediately apologised to the House for his use of unparliamentary language, which was criticised by Deputy Lucinda Creighton, who demanded his suspension. The incident was referred to a sitting of the D√°il committee on procedure and privileges, when it emerged that ""fuck"" is not included among the list of forbidden words set out in the Salient Rulings of the Chair, the document which regulates the behaviour and conduct of TDs. Gogarty later clarified that the outburst was totally unintentional and not premeditated as some had suggested.

That makes this even funnier.

3196,"That's essentially right. The ""Standing Orders"" are the rules of procedure around how bills are submitted, how business proceeds, how members are punished, etc. It's the rulebook. 

The ""Salient Rulings"" are a list of matters that have been previously ruled on, whose rulings can be referred to but aren't strictly ""rules"" as such. So it's kind of weird to treat it as ""not on the list of unparliamentary language"" because a new ruling can rule that any language is unparliamentary at any time. 

It wasn't that the list was planned and ""fuck"" was omitted, it was just that it had never come up that someone had said ""fuck"" before and been punished for it."

3203,"It *is* the parliament, after all. It's like being in an petro-company and discussing pollution from oil."
3204,"This is typical of Parliamentary rules. You can't say that a member is acting in bad faith, or lying. In Britain, if a member wants to say another member is drunk, they say they are *tired and emotional*."

3254,"""feck"" is basically the word fuck's younger, milder brother. Its for when fuck is too severe for the situation, and is more used when you're impatient/frustrated as opposed to angry/horny, as it doesn't really have any of the sexual tones that the word fuck would have. It's also slang for throw sometimes, but mainly in an annoyed ""I asked him to pass that remote and he fecked it across the room at me"" kinda way."

Ironically, insulting and overthrowing fairly elected people has become somewhat normal in Germany because election results that don't lead to the preferred outcome of the ruling elite is ""an attack on democracy"" or some bullshit."

But if you'd like to see this nation become stronger and less toxic over time I would encourage you to take up an attitude that's more understanding of why people have different views than you and not instigate people in to going to full throttle in to their beliefs by mocking their beliefs.

But then he was an even larger and easier target for Brooks, who continued to beat him across the head, face, and shoulders ""to the full extent of [my] power."" Brooks didn't stop when his cane snapped; he continued thrashing Sumner with the piece which held the gold head. Sumner stumbled and reeled convulsively, ""Oh Lord,"" he gasped ""Oh! Oh!"" Near the end of the attack, Sumner collapsed unconscious, although shortly before he succumbed he ""bellowed like a calf"" according to Brooks. Brooks grabbed the falling Sumner, held him up by the lapel with one hand, and continued to lash out at him with the cane in the other.[12][13] Several other Senators and Representatives attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Edmundson, who yelled at the spectators to leave Brooks and Sumner alone,[14] and Keitt, who brandished his own cane and a pistol, and shouted, ""Let them be!"" and ""Let them alone, God damn you, let them alone!"""

3366,"The bubonic plague killed 30% - 60% of the European population. It caused a huge labor shortage. Lords would compete for vassals, offering increased benefits and freedoms.

3399,"I would agree.

But you can't say that the bubonic plague didn't destroy a significant amount of wealth and render many, many people jobless. It was in economic and human terms, a disaster of the highest order. It took people generations to recover.

It was, ultimately, something that benefitted us, but that would be a lot like saying that the World Wars didn't destroy jobs and investments because the EU is now not dominated by hereditary empires, ostensibly communist dictators, and fascists."

3411,"They perform different functions. Nancy Pelosi is the leader of the majority party in the house of representatives. Her role would be more closely related to a prime minister, except she has no executive power, as the executive and legislative branches are seperate in our system where they are performed by the same people in a west minster parliamentary system."
3412,"As mentioned, that's a fairly different role; in parliamentary systems, typically the speaker does not argue for or against anything or vote for or against anything, in order to keep the role relatively nonpartisan; in some representations, they're even removed from the seat count of their party. Whereas the US Speaker of the House very prominently represents their party."
3413,"I mean he is, but like that's not really a response"
3414,The only response that matters is the significant decrease in support for an unpopular government. A  far more eloquent rebuttal than yours.
3415,"It might have had minstrel shows as you contend but it sure didn't have slaves nor an important black population to put the practice to shame. I'm not defending black face, I'm just saying that Canada has it's own taboos.

And you often had to dial (remember the old rotary phones?) several times to even get through. WhatsApp calling is actually pretty amazing and it no longer costs an Arm and a Leg."
3471,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I just did some quick math, and that would only take like 0.25 seconds for my signal to be sent halfway around the world. Which, imo, isnt that bad."
3472,Call someone over WiFi on Hughesnet to get a feel for what they're talking about
3473,TIL people once made phone calls on cell phones.
3474,"We had satellite internet before and it had even worse lag time. Ping to anything was a minimum of 800ms, with 2000ms or more in during peak hours."
3475,"Mmmm, no.

Iridium uses low earth orbits.

It's very expensive."
3476,I used one in the early 1990's in the Army to talk to people in Germany from Iraq and I don't remember lag being an issue.  I was highly impressed by how clear it was.
3477,"Shitty spam article, they didn't even tell the lag time"
3478,Makes conversation awkward.
3479,"Only some of them connect to six geostationary satellites. Those that did did not have ""universal network coverage"". The ones which connect to 114 low Earth orbit satellites have more coverage of the Earth and lower latency."
3480,"Oh, yeah, it's incredibly irritating."
3481,.3 to .5 sec per sat hop. used sat phones when I was in the army and you get use to the lag
3482,"Still, something like texting must be feasible?"
3483,Okay explain this to me please. Apparently satellite phones work but lag. But how come the military has major connection issues? Lone Survivor is a good example.
3484,Besides the fact they're expensive as fuck
3485,So Starlink May be better for this ?

3493,"This is why, for hard sci-fi settings where you would need to send messages across interplanetary distances through normal EM waves, it would make more sense to record and send short messages then wait for a response."
3494,"Yeah, I remember in 1980 talking on a connection from Asia to Texas... it was like talking in a 30 foot PVC tube with static and the vague sounds of metallic twanging (probably repeaters at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean).  I really wish someone had made recordings of those early era  overseas calls for posterity.  The only recording I'm aware of is the one in Pink Floyd's ""Young Lust"", and that call had pretty good quality for its time (UK-US probably had some of the more solid connections).

Also the cost, holy smoke. Overseas calls were about $1-2 a minute back then and higher during the day.  It was super easy to run up a $100 bill.  The Internet sure fixed that."
3495,"When you add the lag due to distance to the lag due to network overhead, you're looking at a lag of more like half a second. While this isn't *terrible*, it's noticeable."
3496,"I remember doing AIM calls on dial-up that had latency like that. It wasn't great, but people would find it intolerable nowadays."
3497,"The satellites are in geostationary orbit, that distance has a much longer delay, close to a second one way, and the signal might have to be sent to multiple satellites."
3498,That is a terrible delay.  Fibre FTW.
3499,That‚Äôs what we used in Afghanistan.
3500,Because the iridium phones the military uses communicate with low earth orbit satellites. Almost no delay.
3501,.25sec
3502,"yes, that's what I was thinking as well. with all the low orbit internet satellites going up, you have to wonder if it could compete with the cellular networks.... the latency issue of the higher orbit satellites would be gone and they'd have better coverage than anyone... but inside a building/tunnel/anything could be tough."
3503,The antennae are too big - even [massively pro-Musk sources](https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-elon-musk-starlink-user-antennas-ufos/) put the smallest phased-array antennae at roughly the size of pizza boxes. I'm a big fan of Starlink but it's not in the same market as Iridium.
3504,"Yeah, but I imagine cost is only where it is as no-one is using it."
3505,[deleted]
3506,"This is why starlink should be a massive improvement. Their orbits are around 340 miles (550 km) in low Earth orbit, much much closer than geostationary orbit which is 35,786 km (22,236 mi)"

The current NFL formed after the amalgamation with the AFL, which happened well after the CFL formed.

Hence why it‚Äôs Super Bowl 55 and Grey Cup 108 next season.

3517,"I think you need to brush up on your football history a bit.  It was called rugby well after rules like forward throwing was introduced. The same organizations have been participating since the early 1900s. Hell the Argonauts are the oldest professional team in North America and were formed in 1873, before the league even formed.

But no matter how you try to spin it the CFL is older. Because if you want to call pre 40s football not football then you have to call pre merger NFL not the NFL."
3518,That actually does seem to be the case in Canada where the early leagues retained the rugby name so I‚Äôll give you that.
3519,"Ya they held onto the Rugby title after the merger that formed the CRU (which would be considered the equivalent to the NFL/AFL merger) until they renamed the league to the CFL.  Hence why it‚Äôs considered the older of the two leagues.  I just thought it was an interesting tidbit.

3527,">In the post World War II era, DuPont Textiles Fibers Department, which was formed in 1952, became its most popular division, dominating the synthetic fiber market worldwide. At this time, women began to emerge as a significant group of consumers because of their need for underwear and hosiery. DuPont conducted market research to find out what women wanted from textiles, then began developing fibers to meet their needs. The ""need"" was a better fiber solution for women's girdles, which were commonly made of rubber at the time. DuPont became interested in developing a synthetic elastic fiber in the 1930s, which was perfected by chemist Joseph Shivers in 1959. Spandex's transformative nature allowed it to be incorporated into other garments besides girdles and undergarments. DuPont launched an extensive publicity campaign for its Lycra brand, taking advertisements and full-page ads in top women's magazines such as Vogue, Glamour, Harper Bazaar, Mademoiselle, McCalls, Ladies Home Journal, and Good Housekeeping. Fashion's original style icon, Audrey Hepburn helped catapult the brand on and off-screen in the late 1950s; models and actress like Joan Collins and Anne-Margret followed Hepburns aesthetic by posing in Lycra clothing for photo shoots and magazine covers.

3708,"I don't think the title expresses what this is very well.
Its essentially that statistically intelligent alien life should exist. The paradox bit is that if it did it should be everywhere and very easy to detect. It takes a very small amount of time relative to the age of the galaxy for every star to be explored. Even if we're using ships/probes travelling at a small fraction of light speed within just a few million years which is nothing when compared to the thousands of millions of years it took for human life to develop.
We ourselves using nothing but tech we already have could technically achieve it in just a few million years. 

The paradox gets worrying when you think if that's the case why hasn't it happened? If intelligent life is common and could fill the galaxy in a few million years why hasn't it?
The conclusion most people come to is that there's a barrier that stops it.
Perhaps it wipes itself out?
Perhaps 'the first' intelligent life who have spent hundreds of millions of years conserving the galaxy stop others from spreading out?
Maybe AI destroys them all?
Most of the answers don't look good for us!

My 'solution' is that intelligent species don't colonise. It seems like the obvious progression when you consider how fast we colonised earth but I just don't think it happens.
The thing is travelling those distances is difficult, the distances are vast and impracticable to travel no mater what tech you have. Perhaps when an intelligence reaches a point where colonisation becomes a need and a reasonable possibility, the need or the desire to do so at a high cost is gone?
If you imagine where technology will be in as little as say 500 years why would we want to travel to the middle of nowhere? We could be living forever, lives simulated inside machines living the perfect life. Who's going to volunteer the risk of death to do something less exciting than what we can do right here!? really want to explore an alien planet? AI can simulate one for you, even more wondrous that will keep you occupied for as long as you desire."
3709,"If we exist, there SHOULD be more life. Don't need a paradox or a theory to tell me that. The universe is potentially infinite, even if finite it would still be exceptionally large, and implausible to explore to it's entirety. So even if extraterrestrial life exists, the odds of them finding us is like finding a needle in a haystack. They would have to be within the scopes of science fiction to have developed technology that would allow them to cross entire galaxies within minutes or seconds. That alone in of itself is very farfetched but not implausible."
3710,"Earth is still quarantined according to the many books dictated by aliens.

They've been here plenty of times and folks have had many encounters---but they gotta be in stealth mode since they are bending the rules.

Basically, humans are just extremeophiles on the galactic scale, so no one even looks at our solar system with its giant spectral lines for oxygen when they're looking for life.

The theory that I think is most likely is just that the vast majority of species just don't care. We currently have at least a dozen species on our planet that are about as smart as humans, but for one reason or another they just don't really want to dedicate themselves to making tools so they can have greater population densities so they can make better tools for greater population densities."
3713,"Fermi Paradox is not a thing at all. It's not a paradox. UfOs have been seen though out history, including this very hour. Aliens have abducted people 100,000s of times.

1. If there is other life out there, it will spread. The universe is billions of years old, a single galactic rotation is enough time to go from hunter gatherers on a single continent, to swarming the entire galaxy. Unless they are all at basically the same phase of development we are in (less than a million years) or before, they would be everywhere.
2. Weather life is made of meat or metal makes no difference at a certain point. Energy consumption and waste heat are going to be the biggest signs of a large civilization. Weather that energy if feeding life as we know it or not will make no difference.
3. There are enough earth like planets out there that we should be swarmed with life like ours. Adding in metal life will just make the paradox worse by adding in even more potential galactic civilizations.
4. Oxygen in this concentrations will seem weird no matter what. Without constant upkeep (ie, life), it would vanish quickly.

They're all probably at the same level of intelligence that our ancestors were once they got onto the whole, ""Let's start investing all our evolution points into tool making."" path. And those species quite clearly have chosen not to do so. 

And that's pretty much what I expect we'd find if we ever managed to get out among the stars.

>As for space we're talking sleeper ships or generational ships over those distances and they may never find suitable habitat. overall I just don't think we're capable now.

Space is a suitable habitat, asteroids have all the component parts and stars have all the energy we could ever ask for. It's just a matter of having the machinery to turn it into the forms you need it in. Those machines already exist on earth. We just need to get them into space.

> in 200-300 years? maybe, though would humanity make it? would we even be the same there's a dozen different ways we could wipe ourselves out from MAD to rogue AI and there's dozens more that could simply set us back economically where building a giant ship to send out into nothingness simply to spread humanity further isn't on the books.

AI would just replace humanity. MAD is less an less likely to happen as time goes on and detection methods get better.

Economic crashes last a decade or two at most.

If anything it seems like civilizations are more robust than normal animal life. Humans inhabit a larger portion of the earth than cockroaches and rats. We can see most issues coming long in advance and have the tools to deal with them. 

>and even if we get one of those ships out there it's no guarantee we'll spread again or even far enough to find other life.

Over a long time scale life will always grow to fill the carrying capacity of theor surroundings. That will always drive further expansion. It doesn't have to be fast. Even if the colonies each average only one more colony ship per millennia you fill out the entire galaxy in no time at all."

3761,"> Mega light sails wouldn't work because the increased area in order to collect light would increase its mass, and the greater the mass the harder it is to increase its speed up to light speed.

No. Because the light pressure makes it mostly self supporting. Building a sail big enough for 10x the thrust, probably only needs 10x the materials.

> And I don't think 'easy' should ever be used in this context. We don't even know if using a black hole driver is possible, let alone feasible to create and the benefits outweigh the costs.

Of course it's relative. But as long as conservation of momentum and energy still work, you could get around the universe at any fraction of the speed of light you want.

When Burt died in the 1960s, the lizards, either by neglect, escape or release, made their way out of the little shop to, of all places, a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. There they found a nice home in a big box air conditioner outside the restaurant and began breeding.

The lizards, known in Italy for dwelling in urban environments, felt right at home in the city, living on insects and basking in the sun. Collins said the lizards‚Äô city dwelling allows for easy access to meals and hiding places.""

In addition to this, tickets at Coachella 1999 were $50 (the festival was in response to Woodstock '99, which resulted in riots, rapes, and 1,200 injuries, which RATM also headlined.) Coachella tickets today are upwards of $430.

3784,"This article is strange.  It ignores the fact that the Soviets almost ruined Georgian wine.  They ordered everyone to grow only two types of grape because they were more ""productive"".  Hundreds, maybe thousands of grape varietals were almost lost.  If it weren't for people keeping little, secret stashes of grapes for themselves, so many types of grapes would have been forgotten.  My wife and I have a vineyard in Kakheti and, while we do have lots of land with the Soviet grapes (they're not bad or anything, just too commmon), we're working on bringing back several other grapes that were almost lost.

But do go.  Or at least try to find Georgian wine locally.  It's remarkable."

I have enclosed three locks for you to open as a gift. I have been watching your videos for years, and with each passing day, I become more sure. Your voice calls to me, like an angelic choir. I watch the swift, nimble movements of your fingers and wonder what they would feel like on my own body. Rest assured, my lock is not so easy to pick and will require a good bit of teasing, and maybe a little action from the tension wrench. When I see you post your video of these locks, I will know that the seeds you have planted in me, I have also planted in you.

With love from your #1 fan,

166,"I'm definitely fully of the belief these days that no lock is secure - you're just paying for a deterrent.

Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets any regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/Is-the-Public-Willing-to-Pay-to-Help-Fix-Climate-Change-.aspx). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own. And [**a carbon tax accelerates the adoption of every other solution**](https://www.drawdown.org/frequently-asked-questions).

In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)) not to mention [create jobs](https://econ.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/sites/econ.ucalgary.ca.manageprofile/files/unitis/publications/1-7729354/Yamazaki_CarbonTax_JEEM_2017.pdf) and [save lives](https://globalchange.mit.edu/news-media/jp-news-outreach/shift-renewable-electricity-win-win-statewide-level).

The best method I've read for sequestering carbon is growing switch grass, burning it, and burying the CO2 in the ground.  The carbon ends up in the ground and you can generate energy from the heat of burning.

To make a significant dent would require factories to be built, and land would need to be converted to switchgrass."

89,"Speak for yourself! I care. And I've made a personal choice to be the change that's needed in the world. 

* I've talked with friends and family about a [carbon tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price). I've convinced several that a carbon tax is a good idea. I've convinced a few to start volunteering for carbon taxes. [34% of Americans would be willing to volunteer for an organization to convince elected officials to act on climate change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). If you feel like you're up against a wall in your own political conversations, [here's some short trainings on how to have better political conversations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/how-to-have-better-political-conversations/). The IPCC has been clear that [carbon pricing is **necessary**](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf), and [talking about climate change has been scientifically shown to be effective at increasing policy support](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/30/14804). 

* It took a few tries, but I published [a Letter to the Editor](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/111) to the largest local paper in my area espousing the need for and benefits of a carbon tax. Maybe you don't read LTEs, but [Congress does](https://www.aclu.org/other/letters-editor-how-write-them-and-why-they-work). 

* I've joined several [organized call-in days](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/text/) asking Congress to take climate change seriously and pass Carbon Fee & Dividend. [These phone calls work](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf), but it will take [at least 100 of us per district](https://republicen.quorum.us/campaign/11713/) to pass a U.S. bill. 

* I wrote to [my favorite podcast](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) about carbon taxes asking them to talk about [the scientific](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economic](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) consensus on their show. When nothing happened, I asked some fellow listeners to write, too. Eventually [they released this episode](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/573) (and [this blog post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/economics-renewables-and-climate-change/)) lauding the benefits of carbon taxes.  

* I've written literally dozens of [letters to my Rep and Senators](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/write-your-representative/) over the last few years asking them to support Carbon Fee & Dividend. I've seen their responses change over the years, too, so I suspect it's working (in fairness, [I'm not the only one](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/accomplishments/), of course). [Over 90% of members of Congress are swayed by contact from constituents](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/citizen-centric-advocacy-2017). 

* I've hosted or co-hosted 4 letter-writing parties so that I could invite people I know to take [meaningful and effective action](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) on climate change.

* At my request, 5 businesses and 2 non-profits have signed [Influencer's Letters to Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/leaders/) calling for Carbon Fee & Dividend. 

* I recruited a friend to help me write a municipal Resolution for our municipality to publicly support Carbon Fee & Dividend. It took a lot of hard work recruiting volunteers from all over the city, sometimes meeting 2-3 times with the same Council member, but eventually it passed unanimously. [Over 100 municipalities have passed similar Resolutions in support of Carbon Fee & Dividend that call on Congress to pass the legislation](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/endorsements/municipal/). 

* I've [tabled](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/290) at several events, usually collecting letters from constituents to their members of Congress

* I started a Meetup in my area to help recruit and train more volunteers who are interested in making this dream a reality. The group now has hundreds of members. I've invited on several new co-leaders who are doing pretty much all the work at this point. 

* It may sound silly, but I invited *almost* all my Facebook friends to ""like"" (and by default, *follow*) CCL on Facebook. Research shows [55% of those who engage with a cause on social media also take additional action](https://www.nptechforgood.com/2013/04/22/12-must-know-stats-about-social-media-fundraising-and-cause-awareness/), and if even 1% of all the friends of everyone who joined just this year became active with CCL, we would have enough volunteers to pass a bill. 

* I gave two [presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/159) to groups of ~20 or so on Carbon Fee & Dividend and why it's a good idea that we should all be advocating for. I [arranged these presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/160) myself. 

* I co-hosted two screenings of [Season 2, Episode 7 of Years of Living Dangerously ""Safe Passage""](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/take-action/host-a-screening/#1485986882331-9e38cb79-9c5e1492-21fb7dd6-03b9bd85-3e3cce1f-2786706c-ee83)

* I attended two meetings in my Representatives' home office to discuss Carbon Fee & Dividend and try to get their support. 

* I've recruited hundreds of Redditors to [join me](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=CarbonTax)

97,A significant amount of the earth has been on fire lately. Pretty sure that increase has something to do with it.
98,"""The last time the planet had a concentration of 300 to 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere was during the mid-Pliocene, 3 million years ago ‚Äî recently enough for the planet to be not radically different than it is today. Back then, temperatures were 2 degrees C to 3 degrees C (3.6 to 5.4¬∞F) above pre-industrial temperatures (though more than 10 degrees C hotter in the Arctic), and sea levels were at least 15-25 meters higher. Forest grew in the Canadian north and grasslands abounded worldwide; the Sahara was probably covered in vegetation. Homo habilis (aka ‚Äúhandy man‚Äù), the first species in the Homo line and probably the first stone-tool users, got a taste of this climate as they arrived on the scene 2.8 million years ago. (Homo sapiens didn‚Äôt show up until 400,000 years ago at the earliest.)

To find a time when the planet‚Äôs air was consistently above 400 ppm you have to look much farther back to the warm part of the Miocene, some 16 million years ago, or the Early Oligocene, about 25 million years ago, when Earth was a very different place and its climate totally dissimilar from what we might expect today.""

However, for anyone else who has the misfortune of reading your temper tantrum, I'm going to correct one key assumption you made that is wrong.

**Consumer CO2 emissions are not the driving force of climate change. Industrial emissions are.** There *is* a non-negligible impact of people's car's and power usage that contributes to rising CO2 levels, but that is not the focus of green energy revitalization plans because they alone cannot stop climate change. It's the backbone industry for things like petroleum products, non-renewable electricity generation, beef, fertilizer, etc that produce the majority share of CO2. Leading these industries into more environmentally and economically stable directions is the only way to halt the progression of climate change."

108,"I know you‚Äôre just trolling, but I‚Äôll bite.  As a former skeptic myself, learning about the history of carbon is what convinced me.  (Note: I‚Äôm still not convinced on a great solution, just that we have a considerable man-made problem on our hands.)

Back in the day, way before mankind, there was so much carbon in the air that humans could not have existed.  Earth‚Äôs air would have been totally toxic to us.  There was also no bacteria that was able to break down dead trees.  So as trees grew and grew, they trapped a bunch of carbon and cleaned up the air to our current enjoyable standards.  When the trees fell they just laid there with all the trapped carbon until they fossilized and eventually turned to oil which still has all of that carbon trapped inside.  (Hence, fossil fuels.)  Then we found these old oil deposits and proceeded to start releasing all of that carbon back into the atmosphere.  Oops!

So it‚Äôs not exactly like planting more trees will totally fix the problem on its own.  Those trees will eventually fall and be eaten up by today‚Äôs bacteria which will release their carbon back into the atmosphere while we keep burning oil and releasing those old gigantic stores of carbon.  It‚Äôs a band-aid.  Maybe it‚Äôd work if we could send all the dead trees out into space or something."

118,"You know what happens when stuff is more expensive? People buy less. Less products bought means companies seek ways to use less carbon, to lower their prices."
119,I largely agree with this. These energy commodities price all things therefore any benefit you get is limited to choking off the ones who can afford to consume least. The emissions problem is largely a problem of the affluent. It certainly won't produce any results by the time CO2 is no longer the main driver of climate change. At some point you can forget about tweaking your emissions because the planet itself will churning out more greenhouse gases than we are. The window of opportunity to act to delay (not avoid) is closing rapidly. We' re simply going to face the full wrath of the consequence of chemical kinetics before we ever agree to do anything meaningful. CO2 is too small a thing to focus on in the long run. It will soon be dwarfed in importance.

A carbon tax where people are paid to not clear tree's like what is happening now helps landholders and all you are ""doing"" is adding more of the same just with higher prices. You are promoting a scheme where companies are going to funnel money as a cost into tree planting at best and then will give these same companies a reason to raise prices and it won't change the pollution coming from these big companies at all, zero, zilch, nada so really all you are doing is spamming for these large companies.

296,Where does it say anything about body count? It literally just says Coronavirus is a bigger threat than terrorism. You can‚Äôt catch terrorism on the subway and then spread terrorism to children and old people around you. Of course an epidemic is more of a threat to mankind than radical people trying to instill fear in people for control and power over them. There are billions of people in China and the potential for mass loss of life is higher plus China is drastically misrepresenting the facts and covering up the true scale of the epidemic there. But go ahead and try and downplay it and write it off as liberal media fake news.

If things were going to shit around me to the point that food availability was a serious long-term concern, I'd absolutely consider robbing the local grocery stores for non-perishables.  

Cooperative behavior (i.e., *not* stealing and hoarding) keeps more people alive and is more efficient when things are going well, but if that cooperation has broken down to the point everyone's starting to starve anyway, the game changes and the non-cooperators will outlast those who keep trying to play when it's time to fight."

It's a settlement case involving one party who has more resources and is acting from a position of stability vs one who tends to have few resources and less stability. It's perfectly legitimate to discuss whether we think the more powerful party is strong-arming, even if it's not a sexual assault case.

Further, while the University is within their rights to do this, doing so rather than more aggressively investigating the case is likely to enable perpetrators and increase the risk of future assaults."
341,In civilized countries. So that doesn't include the US
342,"Fair point. But I‚Äôm missing a few points in the logic train.  No trial, so you aren‚Äôt guilty, but You paid, so most assume you did it.  What‚Äôs the logic in allowing an entity is fining someone over talking about a case?  It‚Äôs not a secret like the coke recipe. And you obviously admit fault, you paid.  How do the courts logic this?  Or is this simply another case of if you have enough money you can corrupt any court system?"
343,Don‚Äôt feed the troll.
344,So victims aren't adults who can enter into contracts?  Can a victim buy a car or sign a lease?
345,The way you talk about it is from a stance that an assault did happen.  The cases we're discussing here had insufficient evidence to prove anything.  They have no legal recourse and the University is making the best of a bad situation to protect all students involved.
346,This is the UK tho
347,">In civilized countries. So that doesn't include the US

If you're gonna shit talk the US at least look into it a bit.

>These and other rights, including family leave, rights against discrimination, or basic job security standards, were designed by the United States Congress and state legislatures to replace individual contract provisions. Statutory rights override even an express written term of a contract, usually unless the contract is more beneficial to an employee. Some federal statutes also envisage that state law rights can improve upon minimum rights."
348,"Part of the purpose of a settlement is that the case is considered resolved. You seek damages for something someone did, you settle rather than going to court, case over. The party in defense may have a problem if after this resolution you go on publicly discussing something they say never happened, and which they can no longer defend in court because the settlement is resolved.

Again, I don't agree with the majority of these NDAs being pushed, but that's the logic."
349,A settlement isn't admitting fault or guilt.   The school wants to protect all students involved and their own reputation.
350,"Sure they can. Just because a person makes a bad decision doesn't mean the organization isn't exploiting them. 

This is especially true talking about universities cuz you're dealing with very young people, who are inclined to see the university staff as figures of authority who they can trust. It is a disgusting betrayal of trust that universities don't protect their students from rape or seek justice after it happens. They do the opposite. 

Also, they're using an nda to suppress information about *violent crimes*. That's beyond evil. Fuck that nda."
351,If someone makes a rape allegation and there is insufficient evidence to prove the claim what more do you want them to do?  It seems like you're implying that anytime a rape allegation is made that a rape happened which is categorically untrue.

479,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement

>is a multilateral agreement for cooperation in signals intelligence between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The alliance of intelligence operations is also known as the Five Eyes.[3][4][5][6][7] In classification markings this is abbreviated as FVEY, with the individual countries being abbreviated as AUS, CAN, NZL, GBR, and USA, respectively


https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data

>The phone, internet and email records of UK citizens not suspected of any wrongdoing have been analysed and stored by America's National Security Agency under a secret deal that was approved by British intelligence officials, according to documents from the whistleblower Edward Snowden.

>In the first explicit confirmation that UK citizens have been caught up in US mass surveillance programs, an NSA memo describes how in 2007 an agreement was reached that allowed the agency to ""unmask"" and hold on to personal data about Britons that had previously been off limits.


Read this too - https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/nsa-americans-personal-data-israel-documents

>The memorandum of understanding, which the Guardian is publishing in full, allows Israel to retain ""any files containing the identities of US persons"" for up to a year. The agreement requests only that the Israelis should consult the NSA's special liaison adviser when such data is found.

>Notably, a much stricter rule was set for US government communications found in the raw intelligence. The Israelis were required to ""destroy upon recognition"" any communication ""that is either to or from an official of the US government"". Such communications included those of ""officials of the executive branch (including the White House, cabinet departments, and independent agencies), the US House of Representatives and Senate (member and staff) and the US federal court system (including, but not limited to, the supreme court)""."
480,"people also don't realise the UK has the best intelligence services in the world and they know about all this and more. they still reccomended Huawei. America is not to be trusted either and the other main competitors, like America - Nokia - are less developed, more expensive, less tested tech"
481,"Well don't worry, China is trying their damnedest to build their empire. I'm sure you'll change your tune when you realize *they're still going to spy on you*, and the difference is that they will not care for you in the slightest."
482,"As you should, citizen."
483,Your forgot the /s
484,"They dont even have to conceal it, they just have to lean on the hopes and faith of an uninformed public. A 2 minute check will turn up info on the CIA that would make you disgusted at any government, but Americans either dont bother to look, or assume that your average white bread american couldnt possibly be convinced to do blood curdling things. People break ranks and dissent constantly. You apparently just ignore that and act like it soesnt happen."
485,Those written in invisible ink
486,And it was later shown that Germany was spying on the US.  The BND worked with the CIA to do things like this.  It is just the nature of spy agencies.
487,"when I say complicit, they found out and decided to not step in and instead keep government contracts flowing"

The peace plan gives the Israelis everything they wanted and the Palestinians nothing.

They will be left with pieces of disjointed territory. They will not be allowed an airport or a sea port. 

They will not be allowed an army to defend themselves.

All access between areas will be controlled by Israel. All trade will be controlled by Israel. 

All the fertile Jordan Valley area and waters will be given to Israel. 

The Palestinians capital will be the Abu Dis area on the outskirts of Jerusalem. This area is currently a waste disposal site for Israeli Settlements.

Trump plan has given two barren desert areas bordering Sinai to the Palestinians and said look we gave you extra land.

There is a map showing how the Palestinians areas would look like if they surrounded by water. It shows the reality of this Bantustan. Even Apartheid South Africa didn't try this shit.

Under the plan, the Palestinians will have less control and power than most US towns, even building permits will be controlled by the Israelis.

528,"The Palestinians had agreed to the the Saudi peace plan and the Oslo plan.   The Israelis agreed to Oslo and then used the loopholes in the plan to seize water, build settler colonies and avoid any equitable settlement.  

The Israelis were never interested in peace with Palestine but in pieces of  Palestine."
529,"Then propose a counter offer. ""These are the things we require to come to the table"". Negotiate, stop wasting money on weapons and terrorist salaries and allow the Palestinian people to prosper. Build schools, mosques, hospitals. FFS Palestinians get billions in humanitarian aid money every year, where is this money going?!?"
530,"The Oslo plan guaranteed Israeli security, which never happened in the first place."
531,Palestinians were offered 97% of the land they asked for in 2008 under Olmert but refused again without a counter offer. Now Abbas wants a time machine to go back to then. A time machine is not a counter offer. Where is the counter offer?
532,"This headline is absurd. He never threatened to rip up anything, only that he agreed that the extradition treaty is ""unbalanced"" and is something to look into.

And this was during a PMQ. He didn't hold a press conference to announce that he was gonna tear up the treaty. He was taking questions as scheduled, and one mentioned extradition. 

Corbyn basically asked (paraphrasing) ""isn't it messed up that the US aren't sending Ann Sacoolas back here to face justice""

To which BoJo responded with (paraphrasing) ""Yeah for sure. Extradition treaty seems unbalanced, def worth looking into""

And that was it. 

So before people start dancing in the street and rain gildings down everywhere, this is much less of an ""Oh wow"" type of story and more of a ""huh"" story"
533,"This headline is sensationalist bullshit,  but he really should rip it up.

&#x200B;

I am not British, nor American, but this whole story has had me pissed.  I'm not miffed about getting a potential wave of negative karma for saying this,  but  Anne Sacoolas  is someone I would like to see in prison or 6 feet under, what she did was criminal and disgusting.

Tbh it should be looked into, and doesn‚Äôt matter that she is a CIA officer, she should not have been driving. The extradition treaty should be honored for both sides. If the USA won‚Äôt honor it then it would be in the best interest to end it and renegotiate or not at all.

538,He ain't doing any of that shit
539,"What sensationalist trash. He never said that at all, and frankly if BoJo takes any further action regarding this whatsoever I'll be shocked."
540,If this ambassador had said a single unkind word about Trump she would already be in the UK facing these charges.
541,Interesting that extradition treaties are not just a sore thorn in authoritarian countries.
542,"Well, he's not wrong that it's unbalanced, but he didn't say he's going to do anything about it, and likely has no intention to. A PM standing up to the US is basically unheard of. We've been their poodle for a long time. Why? We can't afford NOT to be any more. Most of the world thinks we suck, we're net consumers reliant on imports, and half the country still carries on like we're a global empire. It's even less likely a PM will stand up to the US now Brexit has happened, because we need all the friends we can get, and they're not going to be easy to find."
543,"Lol no he wont, BOJO is Trumps fuckboi. He will bitch and moan in front of the cameras then apologize to orange dada and offer the NHS up as an apology."

553,Trump vs UK Trump
554,"The blonds aren‚Äôt getting along, folks."
555,"the wife was a spy, that's why they won't and shouldn't extradite. You never ever send a spy back if they're in in trouble with the authorities, even to a friendly country. What happened is shitty but I agree with US govt stance in this case. The most basic promise that governments make to their spies is that they will back them if their cover is blown. If the US govt extradited this woman back to the country she was spying in to face prosecution, none of our spies could trust the US at all, the backlash would be enormous.

And she probably wasn't spying on the UK. You don't share your nukes with a country you don't trust. She was likely there to spy on other foreigners"
556,Ya he can threaten all kinds of shit but let‚Äôs see what happens. A lot of blather from this clown.
557,Why can't Boris use a hair comb for once?
558,"The UK regularly delays extraditing people to the US -- or they just outright refuse. The US has never previously refused an extradition request.

""Based on the numbers provided to Sir Scott Baker's panel, under this treaty, 130 extradition REQUESTS were submitted from the US to the UK. Of those 130 requests, the UK has refused 10. Of the remaining 120, 77 individuals were extradited from the UK to the US; the other 43 cases remained pending in the UK system, or the individuals returned to the US on their own, or other circumstances made the extradition no longer necessary. During the same time period, **the UK submitted 54 extradition REQUESTS to the US, of which none have been refused**. Of those 54 requests, 38 resulted in extradition of an individual from the US to the UK. In the remaining 16 cases, the individuals either returned to the UK on their own or other circumstances made extradition from the US to the UK no longer necessary.""

The US has extradited 38 US persons from the US to the UK. There have been 77 people extradited from the UK to the US, ""the US has a population about five times the size of the UK, but there have been fewer than twice the number of people extradited to the US than to the UK. The number of US requests is therefore not disproportionate."""

That having been said, ~~Borris~~ Boris can fuck right off. He got his wish to pull out of the EU, and now he needs all the friends he can get as he starts to negotiate partnerships around the world. Tearing up treaties with the US is not going to benefit anyone, and it sure as shit won't make Trump suddenly spawn a conscience and do the right thing.

I feel for the family of the kid that was killed, but nothing ~~Borris~~ Boris is doing is going to help to resolve that situation. I would hope that the British people see this for the shortsighted political posturing that it is.

Edit: spelling the asshat's name correctly this time."
592,"Maybe he should. It does sound like a bad deal for the UK.

But, under the current treaty, the UK extended her diplomatic immunity.

Sure, I think she should go back. But, legally, no one can force her."

604,">This headline is absurd. He never threatened to rip up anything, only that he agreed that the extradition treaty is ""unbalanced"" and is something to look into.

""Boris Johnson said he doesn't really like the extradition treaty, answered questions"".  


Sure will get in lots of ad-revenue clicks with that headline"
605,"Thanks for that, I was almost tempted to scroll through the comments but your analysis pretty much sums it up accurately."
606,"Business insider is a clickbait news source.  It has a good name ‚Äúbusiness insider‚Äù that makes it seem legit.  But ya, it‚Äôs just outrage headlines farming clicks from places like Reddit."
607,Especially funny since the truth is the exact opposite.  This is the first time that the US ever refused to extradite to UK and clearly the UK has no right to demand that immunity be waved.  The U.K. regularly refuses extradition to the US (about 10% of cases) on dubious grounds.
608,"Aghhh, I just those damn clickbait headlines... Thanks for explaining everything!"
609,Also the fact that it's never ever ever going to happen. Diplomatic immunity is just that and no country is going to mess with it. No country. This is going to get downvoted a million times but it's the truth. Also NO ONE is going to volunteer to fly across an ocean and sit in prison. I don't care how much of a good person you are.
610,I could have told you for free that there is no more justice in this world and nothing will happen
611,"And it is not as if it would be wrong of them to demand a new treaty at this point, anyway. The US is harboring a known MURDERER. It's absurd to expect them to be cool with that."
612,American here and I agree...
613,He should absolutely not rip it up. He should eat it like Trump does.
614,">I'm not miffed about getting a potential wave of negative karma for saying this, but Anne Sacoolas is someone I would like to see in prison or 6 feet under, what she did was criminal and disgusting.

Yeah you're really putting yourself out there with this one."
615,Potential wave of negative karma?  That‚Äôs like saying you will risk a wave of negative karma for saying something bad about trump.  This sub overwhelmingly hates that lady
616,"> Anne Sacoolas is someone I would like to see in prison or 6 feet under, what she did was criminal and disgusting.

That attitude is probably part of the reason the US is refusing to extradite her back.  She didn't kill a person on purpose, it was an accident, yet people think she should be put to death.  She should get a fair trial, but that's going to be difficult now."
617,What exactly did she do? I must be missing something.
618,this is just boris pretending. he doesn't give a shit and he isn't gonna do shit.
619,"Break up NATO. Thats his goal.

Destabilize the USA and UK. His tried it in the other EU countries as well, will less success."
620,"Destabilise the EU, cause the US to pull back from their world-police role so they can make moves in eastern Europe?"
621,"> Now things are getting more interesting.

It's really not. Boris didn't threaten to rip anything up. He was asked a question about Sacoolas and more broadly if the extradition treaty is fair, considering the US is helping Sacoolas. 

He responded by saying he agrees that the extradition treaty seems unbalanced and is worth looking into. 

But that doesn't translate to ""threatens to rip up treaty"", nor does it even mean he'll meaningfully pursue any action on the current extradition treaty. 

Especially now that UK has officially begun its year long Brexiting and needs to negotiate trade deals with the US, and in light of the BOE's newest forecasts and reports that paint a unfavorable and dim outlook for growth."
622,Putin is laughing hysterically. He didn't do anything.
623,Putin?
624,"Well, it's not going to be Crimea - you can cross that off. How's *""the lamentation of the women""* looking? I see a lot of that here - but what's it like on the streets?"
625,This is the long game.  There is global political chaos and the balance of power is currently shifting soRussia continues to increase its position of power.  If this is a game of cards Putin doesnt have many chips but he knows that the players at the table with the highest stacks have absolutely no idea how to play poker and every time they go after eachother he stands to gain.
626,"Yeah everything involves Putin 

You conspiracy theorists are fucking mental"
627,"Honestly more competition is good for the world as a whole. Speaking as an American it‚Äôs certainly bad from the US‚Äôs perspective but from a global perspective it will generate better ideas and be a more fierce filter for poor ones. Who knows, this may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. Forcing European countries to innovate more in sectors traditionally dominated by US companies means that Russia and China will find it harder to place their products as well. They can no longer be the nimble dark horse to the US if everyone is doing the same."
628,erm she wasn't a CIA officer her husband was...
629,"He may have not said those exact words but a source familiar with his thinking confirms this is what he meant.
Boris speaks in code."
630,"Great, who wins in the battle between Boris the Blamethrower and Trump the Dumpster Fire?

No one. That‚Äôs who."
631,why do they call him the Blamethrower?
632,Don‚Äôt forget intentionally dropping market prices so their boys can gain even more wealth
633,...and then Boris will sign over UK healthcare to US companies.
634,"If Boris thinks Trump is going to offer any kind of balance then hes got another thing coming. Trump's policy is"" America first"" meaning he will only accept something in the US's favour. 

This is what happens when the insane get into power.

Edit: I'm not praising Trump here. Merely commenting that suggesting any kind of cahoots between these 2 men is a failure to understand at least one of them. If Trump wants a trade deal with the UK then he's going to expect us to accept a ton of concessions."
635,"clout-gathering with the base, that‚Äôs all it is"
636,"Yep.  If the tables were turned and this was a member of the UK intelligence services, they wouldn't extradite her to the US either."
637,Trump stole it.
638,"Haha wow when the facts don't support you, but you wanna bash the US anyway. Christ. 

Edit: a word."
639,"Straight through the middle, or corner to corner?"
640,The dumb people here are the ones that believed the headline
641,The US people agree.

648,"Yes, styles it to look like a clumsy chap from down the road that is overly friendly and just wants the simple things in life and is really interested in you and your well being."
649,According to headlines people seem to be slamming things all the time.
650,Because fracturing the west is kind of Putin's dream scenario.
651,">Murder aside

""Murder"" has a definition, you know?   Unless you're saying that the American lady in question set out with the intent to kill the kid.

In any case, good for Boris.  I don't think (m)any Trump supporters actually fault any country's leader for standing up for what they believe is best for their own country."
652,"Ok, how about we give the UK the woman, and they give us Prince Andrew? We give them a person accused of vehicular manslaughter and they give us an accused globetrotting pedophile. That seems like a fair deal in the interests of justice."
653,I believe there is only 1 R in Boris.
654,I believe that it has recently been revealed that she was in the CIA and not because of her marriage status.
655,"> Sure, I think she should go back. But, legally, no one can force her.

I'd be fine with MI6 grabbing her and taking her back.

US has done it before, what goes around comes around."
656,"They are negotiating against Trump so that's the easy win, as NK, China, Canada, Mexico and Japan and basically every country have proven."
657,FUCK ASSANGE!!!!
658,That's because the Brits aren't savages. How many innocents has the American justice system killed?
659,"American prison system is worse than most comparable democracies 

if America were to improve that, other nations might be more inclined to subject people to their legal system 

every extradition case I‚Äôve ever looked into in any depth has used exactly that, the state of the US prison services (up to and including the death penalty) as argument against sending people to the USA for trial"
660,How about we abolish the death penalty? Win win.
661,Yeah we dont hand over prisoners to savages that have the death penalty.
662,"I think what really gets in my craw is that the headline is literal fake news over an unexciting but important topic. 

The whole ""genre"" of ""X Destroys Y"", ""A Eviscerates B over C"", ""F Spitroasts G on fact check of Jaywalking Policy"" headlines is super annoying, but at the outset readers know there isn't much substance to the article. It's probably a piece about some snappy clapback or dis or calling out someone's lie. No one sees one of those headlines and thinks ""Well this will have new and important information on government policy""

But this is worse than that shit because it is literal fake news. 

""Here, have an exciting headline about how UK is considering taking an aggressive stance towards negotiations and collaboration with the US that could have implications that would impact a very serious and sad news story from last year, but the actual article reveals that its more of ""PM agrees with opinion of other MP""!"

672,Nonsense. She had no right to diplomatic immunity in the first place.
673,"Can you explain to me why they want her to sit in jail.  It was a tragic accident.   

As I understand it, the area is known for errors by Americans driving on the wrong side of the road.  I know that sounds like I am placing blame on the victim, but it does suggest that more caution, especially on a motorbike, should be taken. As well as, the local authorities need to take more action, such as providing larger shoulders."
674,Nobody is accusing her of murder.
675,"Also American, also agree."
676,"She was driving on the wrong side of the road and hit a young lad on (I think) a moped, killing him. 

Truth be told, if she had stayed in the UK and faced up to what she had done, she actually probably wouldn't have had any jail time (or she would have had to do VERY little). As far as I'm aware, it's her first ever offence, and it was clearly accidental. 

But she would probably be treated much more harshly now, since she fled and lied to police about whether or not she was going to leave the country. 

Someone can correct me of I'm wrong, but I think if she visits any other countries that have an extradition agreement with the UK, we can have her extradited from there. So I don't think she'll be allowed to visit many countries for the rest of her life. 

Could be mistaken though."

Trump signed off on two additional members since he came to office, and the Salisbury Poisonings has made the UK one of the most fervently anti-Russia countries in Europe. NATO's never been stronger, and more countries are joining."
685,"The goal was never to specifically destabilise Europe. The game plan was to single out the UK from Europe, establish a German dominance in Central and Eastern Europe, and encourage a French-German power bloc .

686,"I can promise you if Russia shows up in the Baltic states like they did in crimea (no flag/insignia) that trump would not intervene, even though it's NATO defended land."

688,Aside from isolating the UK from Europe and America from most of her long-term allies by helping Trump win?  In those two acts along Putin has done more damage to the West than every proxy war during the Cold War combined.

Not really, [as you can see from the timeline](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/22/harry-dunn-death-timeline-key-events-anne-sacoolas).  The US government asserted that she had diplomatic immunity on August 30th, the UK foreign office asks the US to waive the immunity which the US refuses to do, and she is flown out on a US government plane 15 days later."
730,"Can you provide any evidence that she was 'wasted' as that is not the truth.

First, age of consent doesn't matter when the victim is simultaneously a victim of sex trafficking--consent does not exist for sex trafficking victims (by your own admission, Giuffre was coerced). Second, Ms. Roberts Giuffre stated in court filings, under oath, that Prince Andrew had sex with Epstein and another 8 girls who all appeared to be under the age of 18. But, you, the valiant pedophile defender, are quick to point out that age of consent varies by jurisdiction, ignoring the fact that these were children, not able to even vote, that were being sex trafficked for his filthy pleasure. Who would have ever imagined that pedophiles would know how best to take their disgusting, shameful behavior to jurisdictions that allow sex with minors.

747," Donald Trump Jr. corresponded with WikiLeaks ,  starting in September 2016.  WikiLeaks sent him messages through July 2017. 

U.S. intelligence officials believe with ""high confidence"" that there  is a connection between Russian military intelligence and the entities  Guccifer 2.0, DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks that resulted in the deluge of  hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary  Clinton's associates hitting the Internet in the weeks ahead of the  election.¬† 

 The January 2017 intelligence report confirmed Russian intelligence  ""gained access"" to DNC networks in July 2015, keeping it until at least  June 2016.¬†

Days later, then-candidate Donald Trump joked he hoped Russia would ""find"" Clinton's missing 30,000 emails, causing an uproar from critics.¬†

 ""I love WikiLeaks,"" Mr. Trump said on Oct. 10, 2016.

In  October and November of 2016, WikiLeaks proceeded to publish emails  from former Clinton aide John Podesta, and intelligence officials also  blamed Russia ultimately for the breach.¬†

And then there are his attempts to help Bradley Manning log in to classified systems  under a different user name as something that journalists are ‚Äúethically  required to do: take steps to help their sources maintain their  anonymity.‚Äù

Yet no journalist is ethically required (or even permitted) to try to  hack a password to allow his source to continue his illegal work  undetected. The active participation in the hacking itself makes the  alleged ‚Äújournalist‚Äù a part of the hacking scheme. This isn‚Äôt just  receiving a stolen document; it‚Äôs actively assisting in the theft.

As far as I'm aware, she had to actually claim diplomatic immunity. So she did actively leave. Though I'm not going to claim I know exactly how the whole process works. 

The real crime here is thay the US did not waive diplomatic immunity. The convention states that those with diplomatic immunity are expected to still obey the law of the land, and since killing (whether accidental or otherwise) another person on the road is illegal in both the US and UK, one would have thought that diplomatic immunity would have been waived.

The fact that diplomatic immunity wasn't waived becomes even more shocking when you know that a Georgian diplomat in America had his immunity waived (after the US asked) for killing a young girl in a drunken crash in 1997."
756,"> She did not intentionally drive on the wrong side of the road, it is how they drive in the US, which she had just left 3 weeks prior.

The trafficking is horrendous but again that isn't Andrew doing that. and girls ""appearing to be under the age of 18"" means nothing when the age of consent is 16. NOBODY has claimed he slept with girls under the age of 16."

Thus, it is perfectly acceptable for someone who says ""I hate the French"" to be considered racist, despite the fact that 'french' is not a 'race'.

In common parlance, it is normal useful and practical to refer to someone who is xenophobic as racist.

876,"I'm waay out from an expert; just someone who got salty about right-wing reactionaries trying to pretend they had the 'scientific highground' with their race realism and decided to actually do some reading after high-school.

Essentially one of the major issues we've found in science in the last hundred years or so (and indeed this issue was discussed by Plato) is that our tendency to group things by characteristics (phylogeny by quality) falls apart when you zoom in.This issue comes up everywhere, from race theory, to gender theory, even to evolution and specieation (a similarly out-dated model).

The proof by contradiction is effective in my mind; if it *were* the case that their is such a thing as a 'biological race'; then we should be able to find a way to dilineate those races using biological science - there must exist a biological marker by which we can exclusively group people into races.

Contemporary science has failed to find such markers, and has shown that all previously considered markers are not necessary for those races, and not unique to those races; meaning they are not racial determinants.

this shows up in the gender debate as well; similarly, if there *were* two genders, we would expect to find characteristics that were exclusive to one gender, and never part of another gender.   

These things *seemed* to be the case with out less advanced sciences, but modern gene sequencing (among others) again fails to find a true delineation criteria, and shows that previous criteria (like XX or XY) are not exclusive to either gender."

Correct; saying that there are neatly defined races is exactly what that shows is *not* the case; and since we can categorically *not* draw a conclusion of someones race based on biological criteria, then *necessarily*, any conclusions drawn from the argument '\[this race\] is like this because \[biology\]' is necessarily, fundamentally, flawed.

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.""](https://imgur.com/gallery/aLfAq)

A government by definition governs ALL the people in a specific territory.
A religion's rules, on the other hand, only apply to followers of that religion.

As soon as you're applying religious rules in government you've fucked up because now you're oppressing people who don't follow that religion.

I don't know why but Islam seems to work its way into governments more than other religions. I wish muslims would stop doing that; you can believe whatever you want personally, just don't use government to force others who aren't of your faith into your rules."
1048,"> If it's considered a crime by your government, you live in a theocracy

Not always.

I'm in Indonesia and we famously had a Christian president impeached and imprisoned for blasphemy against the Qu'ran. It kinda backfired though because most Muslims disagreed with the ruling and I know some who even renounced their faith. A lot of Muslim groups spoke up against it calling it blatant corruption and misuse of power by the guy who took the presidency after Ahok's imprisonment.

Ahok is generally seen here as one of the best recent presidents and most Muslims would have preferred that he was able to continue his term. 

Either way Indonesia is definitely not a theocracy since although about 80% of people here are Muslim there are also a lot of Catholics, Hindus and Confucianists as well. In our last election there were men and women from all religions campaigning for the presidency."

1209,"This is all my opinion and nothing else, but religion was absolutely necessary once people started to live together in larger groups and as a simplified version of the timeless questions - where did we come from, why are we here, what happens when we die?

First things first - society. I imagine when people started transitioning from tribes and forming villages and towns, there had to be a way of assuring safety and benefit for all. If you put an all seeing, all knowing entity in the sky that can punish you for all eternity, it takes away the incentive to steal whatever and kill everyone. Like yeah, you may fuck my wife and steal my cow, but the old man in the sky is gonna get ya ten fold later.

At the same time, it offered comfort in knowing what happens when we die, when our loved ones die and that we'll all be together again. It answered the ""where did we come from"", because if you don't take it too literally, the big bang is explained for the common man of the time. Imagine going back a few thousands of years and you'd start going off about how time didn't exist, relativity, formation of matter, atoms, quarks, etc.... people don't understand this stuff today and we have videos, animations, explanations. It also gave people purpose - do good, so you'll be rewarded later. It is something to live for. Look at people now, when we are realising our existence is random, there is no higher purpose, other than the one we create for ourselves. Some can, some can't. That's why depression is at an all time high.

I am not religions myself. Totally opposite. Regardless, I see what religion did for us and how important it was for our development. Is it skewed now? Only when organised. At it's core, it's not evil or corrupt.

I'd just like to add at the end, that I do envy the conviction about an afterlife that believers hold. It sounds really pleasant."
1210,"The way I see it religion is just a means to control people and consolidate power.  You control their ‚Äúthinking‚Äù by laying out some ground rules you want them to follow ( 10 commandments), and make sure everyone who doesn‚Äôt follow is met with harsh faith (see what I did there?). You play into two of the most influential emotions, fear and anger to stay in power. Fear of the unknown (death/future) to make them fall in line, and use anger (mostly for ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù) to move your following."
1211,">  what religion was before it was bastardized.

Pretty much Life and Law. 

Imagine you believing in something so hard it's basically impossible for you to imagine a world without it. Even now, religious believers know that they're making the **choice to believe**. Back then, God existing was like needing to eat. 

People actually paid the Church to have their sins removed. The Church had complete, absolute control over the people. If the Priest said A, then A it was. 

It was worse than indoctrination."
1212,"My issue with the thought that all religions are bad is that there are hundreds if not thousands of religions. A lot of them are actually really chill and peaceful. The big ones tend to be the ones that did the whole, ""Convert or Die"" schtick. Something like 2/3 of the world is either Christian or Muslim."

Islam isn‚Äôt all that bad at all if you read the Quran, but then you have Wahhabism and sailfism (basically the whole Arab world) and it just twists it.

For instance, did you know that homosexuality comes up once in the Quran? And it says that a prophet told the people of Lot that what they were doing was wrong.

That‚Äôs it.

Never says kill them or anything.

And I bet you think that muslims can‚Äôt drink huh? In the Quran it says ‚Äúit brings more sin than good‚Äù

That‚Äôs it. Not ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE GOING TO BURN IN HELL AHHHHHHHHH‚Äù

PEOPLE do this.

But because of the actions of CULTURES, we expect there to be a lot of violence in it.

Hell, even Christianity and Judaism says a lot of fucked up shit about gays, but Islam surprisingly doesn‚Äôt.

Nope! You‚Äôre just as uneducated about the topic as the guy twisting it.

1216,"I won't speak for the guy above, but I'll give you my experience. I am an ex-Muslim partly because of 9/11. After the 9/11 attacks my family and other muslim friends were saying almost the same things as the guy who is often quoted in this thread and article (Abdallah Zekri). Things like America deserved it or had it coming. I would not characterize any of my family as extremist or fundamentalist, but most could not see 9/11 for the evil act on humanity it was. So no for the most part I don't think ""moderates"" often disavow the acts of extremist in my experience."

Islam is still operating like a religion of the Middle Ages, and attempts to modernise it from within have been almost wholly unsuccessful, and often met with the standard threats and violence.

Sure, the would be conquerors seeking ways to pacify their populations and justify the subjugation of others would exist without religion, but religion has been one of the most popular tools for both purposes through history. It provides an artificial sense of community and unity to rally around, an easy way to justify the existing social order, and a convenient and simple method for dehumanizing those you wish to conquer. 

So, yeah, people are at the core of the problem; the human condition. Take our species out of the equation and maybe somewhere out there is a benign and peaceful species perfectly capable of peaceful and benign religion. Maybe someday that will be us. Still, right now, while religion may not be the root cause of the issues that many blame it for, I think it's definitely an accelerant that fuels a lot of violence and hate.

This is ridiculous. The Qu'ran is full of immoral nonsense. 

More to the point, the entire premise of your post is that Islam is ""really"", or is ""supposed to be"" just what's it the Qu'ran; in reality, this perspective - Qu'ranism - like its Jewish equivalent (Karaite Judaism), is and has always been a very small minority view. Hadith, and the opinions of scholars of the various schools of Islamic jurisprudence, have always formed part of orthdox Islam.

>Now, let's be clear: left-wing violence does exist, but the scope of it is far, far less than right-wing terrorism. That's just an objective fact. (There is also a case to be made that the violence of Antifa is reactive, whereas violence from the alt-right can be seen as proactive, but that's a bit more nebulous.) A 2017 study by The Nation Institute and Center for Investigative Reporting found that between 2008 and 2016, there were:

>115 Far right inspired terror incidents. 29% resulted in fatalities. These terror incidents caused 79 deaths.

>63 Islamist inspired terror incidents. 13% resulted in fatalities. These terror incidents caused 90 deaths.

>19 incidents inspired by left-wing ideologies and eco-terrorism). 10% resulted in fatalities. These terror incidents caused 7 deaths.

It's also silly that far right and islamist terror are often categorized as two different categories... They're both far right ideologies.  So, I really don't understand why people like to downplay that link as well.

There will always be bad seeds. There will always be yin and yang. There will always be the mentally ill within the healthy. However, to ignore the larger scale in how much it happens within a specific group of supporters and their leaders is ignorant.  It's a problem within the institution; the leaders know it benefits them as leaders (psychopaths, most likely) and then you have other people that condone it with verbiage like

Some of these fundamentalists even think that the Vatican is too modern (!) to their tastes and do not recognize the Pope as head of their church."

How, in that case, I am asked, do I find meaning and purpose in life? How does a mere and gross materialist, with no expectation of a life to come, decide what, if anything, is worth caring about?

>Depending on my mood, I sometimes but not always refrain from pointing out what a breathtakingly insulting and patronizing question this is. (It is on a par with the equally subtle inquiry: Since you don't believe in our god, what stops you from stealing and lying and raping and killing to your heart's content?) Just as the answer to the latter question is: self-respect and the desire for the respect of others‚Äîwhile in the meantime it is precisely those who think they have divine permission who are truly capable of any atrocity‚Äîso the answer to the first question falls into two parts. A life that partakes even a little of friendship, love, irony, humor, parenthood, literature, and music, and the chance to take part in battles for the liberation of others cannot be called 'meaningless' except if the person living it is also an existentialist and elects to call it so. It could be that all existence is a pointless joke, but it is not in fact possible to live one's everyday life as if this were so.

Oh you're the fun kind of atheist. I'm one myself, mind you, but the difference is that I can respect religion. Old dead wizards or not, religion has real important meaning for billions of people. How do expect to engage in meaningful discussion with those or any religious people if your only acceptable line of thought or argument is ""Nope your holy book is Lord of the Rings, and you're a fucking idiot."" I don't believe in any religion, but you don't talk to someone by insulting them. Calling someone's religion which may be of profound importance or meaing to them a ""wacky magician battle story"" doesn't make you ""smart"" or ""enlightened"" for seeing the truth that those silly religious masses don't, it makes you an asshole. 

By all means, feel free to shout into your echo chamber of atheistic bigotry, but do try to stay out of meaningful religious conversation."

It's a little easier to do violent sexist deeds though when your religion's prophet is a warmongering sexist. Christianity can still be homophobic, but you never saw Jesus threatening to kill people if they didnt follow his teachings. I'm sure there are good examples of this in other religions, but I only really know anything about Christianity and Islam."

1336,"Eh it's kinda weird. Ancient Israelites in the OT totally conquered/absorbed other nations, religions and peoples. They weren't really what we call Jews today though, kinda like an ancient proto-Jewish religion. 

There's a whole story about an entire city circumcising and converting, and some of the Israelites go ahead an massacre the city anyway- which of course is portrayed as a bad idea. So mass conversions to a form of Judaism are in there, and even whack ones where they went ahead and killed everyone anyway.

Bear in mind what's in the OT is really different than any modern Jewish denomination- even the most Orthodox. Very, very different."
1337,Except that your friend isn't threatening you with eternal torture for not doing what they ask or what they think is right. Your friend is also not promising a pleasant afterlife if you do what they say. Putting it more bluntly your friend has no perceived power over you. Religion does.
1338,"I once saw it hypothesised that the lack of inherent protection in the US for any specific religion made the religious groups far more dogmatic and power-grasping than elsewhere. For example, in the UK the Church of England had guaranteed power and protections (still has unfortunately) but perhaps that led to it becoming lazy and not having to fight to maintain that or energize voters. Hence we are now a country where the vast majority don't really give a crap about religion anymore, certainly not to the extent that anyone is particularly concerned about the CofE influencing government (although I would like to see the guaranteed seats in the Lords for bishops removed). If anything its the minority religions causing issues in unregulated schools."

The ancients just didn't have as advanced a morality as we do.

1347,"Saudi Arabia and Iran are interesting because they seem to me to be polar opposites.  Both totalitarian, yes, but coming at it from different angles.

In Saudi Arabia, there is a hugely conservative and Islamist society that is very set in its ways.  The governance (not government) of the country comes from two different authorities - the monarchy and its thousands of princes on one hand and the Wahhabi religious authorities on the other.  These two institutions coexist peacefully.  Meanwhile, you have a large portion of the community identifying as Salafists, an even more conservative branch of Islam.  The monarchy is attempting to slowly secularize, but they receive push back from both the Wahhabi religious leaders and society at large.  Meaning, the monarchy WANTS to be less religious, but the people really aren't allowing it.

Meanwhile, in the metropolitan areas of Iran, there is a large portion of people who are secular and would like to live more like a European than adhere to the strict rules imposed on them by the government.  A majority of Iran is religious, but mainly in the countryside - places like Tehran are secular and modern.  So you have kind of the opposite happening from Saudi Arabia.  The religious authorities get their powers from the hinterlands and force that religion on the people of the metropole.  So overall, the religious people of Iran are getting their way with the leadership, but the traditional bases of power are more powerless."

There are plenty of examples where this ""argument"" is used for good, but it is quite easy for someone evil to wield that power to control others and have them do the unthinkable."
1350,"Exactly, religion is just part of culture."
1351,"Yes. I took a History of Islam class in college, decades ago, and I remember the TA explaining that most of the misogynistic behaviors in Muslim countries are not at all supported by the Koran, only the local culture. 

Too bad I barely remember anything from that class, because it sure would have been useful in later years."
1352,"Yeah and places like Tunisia, where women run most of the government, are paid equally, and treated equally. They are a good example of how a Muslim country should behave. Equal rights for all and progressive society."

1360,"You've read much too far into my comment. So much so that you've commented on things that aren't there.

I'll forgive your dismissive tone, lest it diminish my self worth. I'm not worthy of a opinion. Let's not forget that.

I think you need to take a step back and look at the word you've used to describe yourself; Atheist. What is that word? What does it mean? Who decides when and where that word is applied, and to whom? Before we get into semantics, let's group all similar adjectives in with it: agnostic, skeptic, nonbeliever, etc.

A-theism: without theism; or the belief in deity. 

Now imagine when that word was first used, and by whom. Is it any different today? Do you see any flaws in that social contract? I do.

Maybe ""magician battle"" was a bit harsh. I'll give you that, but the tales told by most religions are farcical recollections, bred of a time when reality was MUCH different than it is today. That being said, in many cases the faith as it was presented at the time was likely much more attractive than the current reality in which those faithful lived. The same can be true in 2020, but the perversion of those faiths has become exactly the thing that they were created to ward against.

The word ""atheist"" itself is bigoted unless it's being used by the pope. Most ""atheists"" live a more faithful life than most faithful."
1361,The argument that religion deserves respect is simple rubbish. Prove your claim or keep it to yourself. No-one wants to hear from you what your god mandates for them...let your god speak for himself - directly to everyone - if it can't do that then it's fucking useless and impotent.

Being dismissive of other people's opinion, even if you think they're wrong, is not a good way to open a dialogue. If we want people with religious beliefs listen to us, we must also listen to them. However, you should also be cognizant that even if we listen to them, they may not listen to us.

So, the impulse to respond in kind and be dismissive is understandable. But for the world to get better, we need to rise above that."
1389,"> religion as a whole

>religious zealots

Well there's you're problem right there. You've placed the extremist minority on the same level as the overwhelming majority of normal people. Religious zealots *are* the same as flat-earthers and climate change deniers: they are extremists of their view who are unwilling to listen to other points of view, and may even get angry when they are contradicted. *Any* belief will spawn extremists. Religious, non-religious, scientific, philosophical, anything. 

But religion as a whole is incredibly valuable. At it's most fundamental level, it is no more than a tool to make people happy. It gives people hope, it can (and I use this word very cautiously) save people, it can make them happy and give meaning to their life. Billions of people find profound value and meaning in their faith. This is not detrimental, this is wonderful, even if it does not have value to you. 

If you consider religion as a whole to be detrimental to humanity, I would urge you to consider what value religion may have, both to humanity and to the individuals who constitute it."
1390,"And you can do that, but what do you hope to achieve by telling us this? It kinda looks like you're just looking for an excuse to piss people off and if so, that puts you in the same place as these people in the article looking for an excuse to get pissed off"
1391,"then disprove religion through having a contextualised answer rather than dismissing their point just because it differs to your own.

tell them of the origin of christianity, not with jesus but with Nicaea where they stripped away and edited their doctrine which allowed political interference. take it back so you can explain to them the origin of Israel and antidiluvian times where Gods are described to compete for a higherarchy due to individual cities having their own Gods, who rose and fell based on the success of the city/culture they were connected with. 

Why put people off listening to you when theres eons of evidence of the earths existance that you can draw on to help you. And if you believe that the political nature of it is the problem then fuck history, focus your arguments on what the church does today or has refused to acknowledge/apologise for -theres plenty without having to belittle someones beliefs or bring up examples like the crusades that dont change opinion"
1392,"Idk what Hitchens Atheism is as I haven't heard that term before so I'm going to use your definition that it's an atheist who believes religion as a whole is detrimental to society. 

Now I think that is a perfectly valid belief to hold. But if you express that belief by attacking or belittling others for their beliefs are you any different from the Evangelical Christian yelling slurs at a gay couple? 

Something that you believe is causing you to attack somebody with a differing belief and you are refusing to respect that belief. Whether you belief in religion or not your actions are the same as those of a religious zealot based on something you believe and I'd argue they are just as detrimental to humanity. 

Ultimately I think what people believe has no effect on anyone but themselves, it's what they do with that belief that is a problem. Regardless of whether you are Christian or Muslim or Atheist, if you use those beliefs as an excuse to attack, belittle, disrespect, or control others, now you are having a negative effect on humanity."
1393,In neither of those scenarios do your method of action seem either effective or reasonable. Even if you think it‚Äôs detrimental to society it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that belittling and insulting people pales in comparison to civil discussion/discourse in terms of swaying their opinion.
1394,"They're no better than atheistic bigots. Two sides of the same shitty coin. A religion is its people, and some people are assholes. This does not mean the religion, or religions in general, are bad. No more than ski masks are bad because bank-robbers wear them. I may not be a religious man but, in my study of religion, there is a single philosophy (from Buddhism) that I have found profoundly useful in all aspects of life: the Middle Path.

*""Extremes in any direction are bad.""*

Technically, its original context was the practice of asceticism (denying your body for spiritual gain), but really it applies to any situation you can think of. It applies to religious devotion as well. If you're calling atheists/religious people idiots or murderers or aliens or whatever, you are an extremist (though you may not be militant).

If you refuse to engage in meaningful discussion with someone who has a different opinion than you, on the grounds that they have a different opinion, or if you cannot do so without also considering their view, then your opinions are not needed. This is as true for people who think atheists are murderers as it is for people who think religious people are delusional idiots. 

If someone religious is making you feel bad or insulting you for being an atheist, they're an asshole and you don't need to talk to them. If someone atheistic is making you feel bad or insulting you for being religious, they're an asshole and you don't need to talk to them. Just don't talk to assholes (easier said than done I guess, but there you have it)."

If all religions were equally bad, than either all episodes would be banned or none of the episodes would be banned. Obviously one stands out enough to get Comedy Central to ban an episode."

>I don't see how there is a 'jealous ex' problem. I feel rather that the UK did not anticipate to be treated like any other country that is outside of the EU. That was an argument against brexit btw.

The UK is aiming to be treated like any other country, the EU wants to treat it like any other country for access, but like an EU member for regulatory control, because the EU (sensibly..) doesn't want a major economy on its doorstep, outside of its regulatory orbit. The issue for the EU isn't that the UK wants an overly close relationship, or more access than the EU wants to give, its that the EU seems to think that it can keep the UK in a much closer relationship than it wants, without the access.. 

>Now people realise that being a tiny country in global terms also means you have little bargaining power.

The UK isn't a tiny country by any measure, and the problem here isn't that the EU is about to impose something on the UK, it isn't. The issue here is that the EU is about to end up not able to use the leverage it has because the UK walks away."
1431,"This. Its business and money mate. UK lost all rights to it and got a nice cinder block around its leg. Dunno why so many people think it was greatest idea ever... 

Trump smacks UK trade deal, either NHS gets sold and bleached chicken in or no deal. EU free trade deal...gone.  Checks at border, Scots getting enough of this bullshit. I think Union it self gonna crumble soon."
1432,"Right, and the issue the EU has is that it wants to be both tough, and limit UK access (which it can do..) but it also wants to be able to set the rules for the UK to limit the UK's ability to compete.. It's not going to get both.

Either the EU is open to the UK and can limit its ability to compete (maybe, assuming the UK agrees to that approach) by pulling it into its regulatory orbit in exchange, or it can try to limit the UK's access. But in the latter, it then loses the ability to retain the UK in its regulatory orbit.

The EU is trying to do both, that simply won't fly (it'll end up with the UK outside of its regulatory orbit and no preferential access in either direction).

The EU isn't managing to use its weight to secure anything in this context, it is going to end up wasting the significant leverage it has by not getting an agreement."
1433,">Well, if the UK don't like the deal, it can go an ask any of the other superpotences... 

No, if the UK doesn't like the deal it'll just say no.

>the UK has no leverage at all to bargain in a position of power against any big market, this is the future of a small country in a world of super potences. The EU is doing what is in the best interest of the European citizens, period.

The UK is a big market, not as large as the US, China or the EU, but still pretty damn big, it's bigger than the majority of the markets that the EU has trade deals with.

The EU obviously has to do what's right for the EU, my point is more that the current approach isn't going to get them there as it'll result in them wasting what leverage they have and getting nothing at the other end of it.

Ôøº"
1434,Erm. OK.
1435,"I think you have to look at Norway and Switzerland as comparison. The regulatory power you talk about is naturally being accepted also by them. Without certain regulatory alignment it is impossible to do trade.

But the EU can make the rules of course, and just expect the much smaller UK to accept them. That is just how it works if you are an almost 500 million people market versus a country only marginally more than 10% of that.

 With Scotland maybe leaving the UK (and many expect N. Ireland to do the same in the long run) there is a bumpy ride ahead for the UK.

But we will see. Right now many brexiteers still have a big mouth and utter empty threats because they have not arrived in the world of international negotiation yet.

1436,"We should keep in mind that both sides are talking tough before the negotiations have properly kicked off. But we also have to remember that the EU won't accept any watering down of its regulations. 
So I think in the end the result will be a no deal, or the UK concedes that it has to abide by EU standards and regulations in exchange for a certain degree of free access for its companies to the EU market. Probably with financial services being the most important factor. Given how far removed from reality the rhetoric especially in the UK has become, a no deal looks increasingly likely."
1437,"The current approach is the same that we had for the last three years, the UK representatives consider they are entitled to all benefits and none of the responsabilities of being a member state, they use the EU as scapegoat for the baboon cage is their parliament and their mismanagement of their whole country for the last 20 years, the EU says no to all of their pretensions, they get a no deal.

The UK keeps pushing ludicruous and delusional deals, the EU keeps saying, no, and that is the end.

The UK will learn the hard way this lesson, they had made their own bed and are responsible for everything is happening, the EU is obligated to nothing.

Keep in mind that this will be every single trade deal that the UK bargains for from now on they are not part of the EU, they will always get the bad end of the stick when bargaining with other superpotences, as they do not need the UK but the UK needs them, hence the lack of bargaining power."
1438,"> No, if the UK doesn't like the deal it'll just say no.

Oh, well that's OK then. Never mind the disasterous consequences!

You act as if it's the EU that has everything to lose from no-deal!"
1439,">I think you have to look at Norway and Switzerland as comparison. The regulatory power you talk about is naturally being accepted also by them. Without certain regulatory alignment it is impossible to do trade.

Neither are comparable in size to the UK though, not by any stretch, and I don't think the EU wants to replicate what it has with Switzerland (And the UK doesn't want a slew of interdependent agreements either).

>But the EU can make the rules of course, and just expect the much smaller UK to accept them. That is just how it works if you are an almost 500 million people market versus a country only marginally more than 10% of that.

Sure, but the UK can say no, that's the issue for the EU here. If the UK decides it doesn't like the agreement it can be treated like any other third country with no additional agreement (beyond what is included in the WA) in place. At the moment the EU has made it easy for EU firms to remain in the UK market for example, they'll likely continue, but they don't have to.

And yes the UK market is only about 1/7th of the EU market, but it's bigger than anyone bar Japan that the EU has a trade deal with, it's  twice as large as all bar the top 15 economies and larger than the bottom 120 combined. It's not a small country. It can't force the EU to do anything either of course, but it can say no.

>With Scotland maybe leaving the UK (and many expect N. Ireland to do the same in the long run) there is a bumpy ride ahead for the UK.

It remains to be seen if either leave.. I'd certainly prefer them to stay, it's their choice..

>But we will see. Right now many brexiteers still have a big mouth and utter empty threats because they have not arrived in the world of international negotiation yet.

Right.."
1440,Part of the issue is that the UK wants forever rights even if things change. The EU of course wants the ability to revoke access as they have with other countries.
1441,">We should keep in mind that both sides are talking tough before the negotiations have properly kicked off. 

Sure.

>But we also have to remember that the EU won't accept any watering down of its regulations. 

The UK isn't in the EU, it won't require the EU to water down anything.. Generally countries aren't regulated by other countries after all.

>So I think in the end the result will be a no deal, or the UK concedes that it has to abide by EU standards and regulations in exchange for a certain degree of free access for its companies to the EU market. Probably with financial services being the most important factor. Given how far removed from reality the rhetoric especially in the UK has become, a no deal looks increasingly likely.

Probably not. The request here was for longer term guarantees to financial services access, that would have been worth something (in terms of stability). If not, it'd be accessing EU markets on the same basis as the US does. IT's less than ideal, but still manageable.  The only way this ends with no-deal is if the EU decides it really does want everything hooked together in one deal, which the UK seems keen to avoid this time."
1442,"They do not understand that they left this free trade zone, not zone them. As u said hard way will teach better lesson then any word."
1443,">The current approach is the same that we had for the last three years, the UK representatives consider they are entitled to all benefits and none of the responsabilities of being a member state, they use the EU as scapegoat for the baboon cage is their parliament and their mismanagement of their whole country for the last 20 years, the EU says no to all of their pretensions, they get a no deal.

Not really. The UK has said it doesn't want to be in the SM repeatedly and that it would prefer a more distant relationship. It has been clear that it wants to give up the benefits of EU membership.

The EU has only just apparently figured out that the UK really does intend to leave the SM and CU. You can probably also throw in that those supporting the EU on this seem to get really confused about what the 'costs' and what the 'benefits' or EU membership are, because things like FoM seems to suddenly get shoved into the costs pile when the UK suggests it doesn't want to continue that either.. Rather than a benefit, which is how it is sold the rest of the time (and frankly should be..).

>The UK keeps pushing ludicruous and delusional deals, the EU keeps saying, no, and that is the end.

Not really no.. 

>The UK will learn the hard way this lesson, they had made their own bed and are responsible for everything is happening, the EU is obligated to nothing.

Sure, the point though is that that results in a no-deal, which is far from optimal for either side. It isn't a disaster for the UK or the EU, but hey. The EU does have what amounts to a peak amount of leverage now, if it fails to pull together an agreeable deal, it'll be somewhat wasted.

>Keep in mind that this will be every single trade deal that the UK bargains for from now on they are not part of the EU, they will always get the band end of the stick when bargaining with other superpotences, as they do not need the UK but the UK needs them, hence the lack of bargaining power.

Erm yeah. That's not a thing unless you think that Canada, Japan, Australia etc.. are all getting the bad end of the stick from the EU (they aren't..). The thing with trade deals is that if either party doesn't like the outcome, they can just say no."
1444,"> Neither are comparable in size to the UK though, not by any stretch, 

Size is irrelevant though. The EU treats member states equally and it wants to treat non-member states as equal to each other when agreements are formed.

To be honest, your attitude is exactly what we expect from Leave voters - claim beforehand that we can ""have our cake and eat it"" and expect the UK to do what's in its best interest, but then complain the EU is being ""unfair"" and ""jealous"" when it attempts to do what's in ITS best interest.

And you were warned. You've been warned many times that the EU holds all the cards. Get used to this, because this is what will happen when we negotiate deals with the likes of the US, China, India and Australia - we are now a small fish in a very big pond, despite the lies the Leave campaign have told. More fool you for believing them."
1445,"You said initially you want the UK just not being treated worse than other noon EU countries. I then point out that it is not the case anyhow, by giving examples. To which you indicate that the UK is a much bigger economy. And that you would not want the status of Switzerland.

So you prove my point then. You do not want the conditions Switzerland has to accept, but you still want the trade advantages they have. Because you feel the UK is entitled to it due to its ""importance"" as reading partner.

So you do not want being treated like the others. You want a special treatment."
1446,"> The UK isn't in the EU, it won't require the EU to water down anything.. Generally countries aren't regulated by other countries after all.

You don't seem to understand that in order to trade with other countries you have to agree a set of rules. The EU's rules are that they won't accept free trade with countries that don't abide by its standards. The UK is saying it won't align itself with those standards.

The ball is entirely in the UK's court here. It can abide by the rules the EU sets or it can decide not to have a trade agreement.

The UK needs the EU a lot more than the other way around, and the EU is much, much bigger than the UK. This is not an agreement between equals. This is like the UK trading with Mali. They need us more than we need them, so they'll bend to our rules. With the EU we get the reverse. 

Get used to it."
1447,"The EU has no trade deal with Australia, and mind you, Canada and Japan have a more important geopolitical position than the UK."
1448,"> It has been clear that it wants to give up the benefits of EU membership.

No. No it **really** hasn't. Boris has, in fact, been promising exactly the opposite.

My friend, you are in for one hell of a shock in the coming year or so as the UK finds itself repeatedly on the raw end of trade deals.

We know you'll try to blame the EU, but when we also get a poor deal with the US, who are you going to blame then?"
