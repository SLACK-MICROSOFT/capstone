RX5700 series graphic cards has been out for few month now. But drivers for mining from AMD hasn’t been the best. Recently most popular mining OS Simple-mining and hiveOS has added support for these graphic cards. It is not perfect but mining is doable on these cards now, and the results are impressive. Im not saying here GPU mining is now profitable, you still have to be mining fanatic like i am to build GPU mining rig with new hardware.

There is nearly no difference in hash-rate RX5700 and RX5700XT . It is no point spending extra 20% on gpu to increase hashrate by less then 1%. So if you are mining Ethereum stick to RX5700

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 300,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

HiveOS is the ultimate mining monitoring and control tool for your mining operation. Specially if you do have large mining farm, it is very useful and very easy to setup. So i have created installation guide with Flasher utility. In simple words plugin usb or any other hardrive before booting mining rig. And it will install hiveOS to your mining rig hard-drive. But before that your will need usb stick or ssd and hiveos account. If you dont have one here is link how to create one [here](https://mineshop.eu/2018/07/27/how-to-install-hiveos-and-setup-for-mining/).

Se the steps for gpu rig installation are :

* Download hiveOS flasher latest version [http://download.hiveos.farm/hive-flasher-20180910.7z](http://download.hiveos.farm/hive-flasher-20180910.7z)
* Also you will need installation tool (hdd raw copy tool or  Etcher)[ http://download.hiveos.farm/](http://download.hiveos.farm/)

&#x200B;

* Download latest GPU hiveOS image https://hiveos.farm/install/

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tdpmihuphfy31.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=70d6168b41a5ceed16e32db8782f7571973552b4

* When all the downloads are finished save and unpack them in one folder, this way will be easier to work with. For installation to flash-drive i will be using Etcher.So insert your usb flashdrive into PC and choose Flasher image in Etcher to load on this usb drive.

&#x200B;

* After you have flashed your hard-drive with hiveOS flasher, next thing is to copy over latest hiveOS image file.
* Next edit your flasher sample-rig text file and insert your farmhash , you can find your farm hash in your hiveos account under farm settings.

&#x200B;

* Now your hard-drive is ready for flashing, you can insert it in your mining rig. Boot up and go into motherboard bios, select primary boot option from your hiveos flashing utility.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8zvkoasshfy31.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8eaeac5e5a7964545e1b37041a8305fddc682f6

* After reboot it will start to install hiveos on your mining rig hard-drive. When it will finish , it will shutdown your system
* Then remove your flashing utility from mining rig and boot. It should automatically connect to your hiveos account.

* 8 RX 470 4GB gpus
* B250 Mining Board (looks like the Asus mining expert)
* 8GB of ram
* LGA 1151 CPU, (probably celeron or pentium series)
* A 1000 GQ evga PSU
* An 850 GQ evga PSU
* 8 Pcie risers/cables
* And a mining case

Even though profitability is down, if I mined with free electricity in a dorm room with this thing, I see no downside; Nicehash shows a $2.65 daily profitability. This means that in roughly half a year this would ROI if things stay the same. Even if things go extremely sour, I can just part out the rig and be positive. Obviously though I see some downfalls:

\-Problem: I get shut down by my university, Solution: is to just part the whole rig out and get back my $$

\-Problem: Profitability lowers a lot, Solution: again, just part out for $$.

I see little risk with big reward here, since I can probably part this out and make money from it right from the beginning, even if I don't mine on it. What do you guys think about this deal?",1572696824.0

I think my question might have a very  different background than most asked here. I'm interested in mining not  because I'm interested in maximizing profit, but rather on a hobby  level. I like Ethereum, and I have a gpu available. I'm not going to go  out and build rigs, nor invest in any other significant change (like  changing my OS). I agree, for the serious miner, Debian is not the right  choice for an OS. I am not a serious miner. But I would like to offer  my hashpower to Ethereum. Maybe we can make something work?

As  I mentioned before, I'm on Debian. I recently got my gpu working with  Mesa for graphics. The AMD graphical drivers totally bork my system (I  worked on them long enough to have details, if anyone is interested). As  far as I can tell, there isn't an Ethereum miner that supports Mesa  (OpenGL), only AMDGPU-PRO. Okay. I have a bunch of questions, maybe  someone here will have an idea for me:

* Only  the graphical drivers seem to be a problem. Does anyone know if the  Mesa/OpenGL drivers and headless (non-graphical) AMDGPU-PRO drivers can  coexist without making my computer scream?
* Alternatively,  does anyone know of some kind of version of AMDGPU-PRO that workd on  Debian? I have a suspicion that way older AMD drivers could work, as the  major problem with the Ubuntu driver on Debian seems to be the HWE  libraries (HWE only exists on Ubuntu, not Debian). That would mean using  drivers from 2016, as far as I can tell. I'm none too thrilled about  that idea.

My question: I have an old 380W PSU that I’m repurposing as a benchtop power supply for hobbies. I used a breakout board for convenience, but although it’s a 380W PSU the actual breakout board only connects to the 24 pin MOBO plug and so I don’t have all of it at my disposal. Each rail has a 5A fuse built into the board and so it’s 60W, 60W, 25W, and 16.5W total. [https://i.imgur.com/Gmd1xr4.png](https://i.imgur.com/Gmd1xr4.png)

Is there any way to find out how much the extra (not MOBO) cables can provide if I forget the breakout board and draw driectly from the Molex, for example? It’s not as simple as looking up the maximum wattage that a Molex connector can handle, because I would HOPE the PSU manufacturers use plugs that are rated for much higher than the circuit could actually apply, for obvious reasons. Could it be that the 12V rails really could pull 380W through the 24pin, but the 5A fuses on the breakout board are just arbitrarily limiting it?

Here’s the breakout board if you want one – it enables you to repurpose an old PSU without cutting the wires! I can confirm that it works great, I just need way more than 12V @ 5A for this one project.  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FKN19YH/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FKN19YH/)

I'm also not opposed to doing CPU mining.  I have an AMD 1700, which I understand is not the best to doing so, so idk if THAT would be worthwhile on this machine, but maybe I can combine the two on a dedicated mining one?

I re-installed the drivers, and on reboot I got a POST code. 6 beeps, which happens to be a GPU failure. I tried booting without the card inserted, and it booted just fine.

I thought, no big deal, I'll just put in a support ticket. Of course, I wasn't thinking and made the mistake of telling them I was mining on it. I received a reply very fast:

    Thank you for reaching out to us. Unfortunately we do not support this type of use case for the cards. Here is a quick excerpt from our warrant terms.

I co-founded and currently operate a mid-sized GPU based mining operation in Washington, US named Bit Capital Group or BitCap for short. We have been operating and hosting for clients since mid 2017. I have personally been in the crypto space since 2014. We have filled up the warehouse 80% and are looking to host for clients for the remaining 20%. We currently have over 300 rigs under management.

Many of you live in areas that have power rates that are far too high for a good margin in this market. I am posting here in hopes you consider sending your equipment to a professional hosting company like BitCap. We charge $0.075/kwh + 5% revenue share for everything your miner needs: power, cooling, internet, maintenance. We are able to do this because of cheap hydro power out in Washington state. 7.5 cents is well below the national average for power. You can outsource all the headache and build in a greater margin for your mining investment.
 
I recently wrote a newsletter discussing [some of the upcoming forks that may benefit GPU miners.](https://www.bitcap.co/blog-posts/2019/9/24/september-2019-newsletter)

[I also periodically give video updates of the altcoin mining market.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE3hAS4kPrpEOWYI7AOw_Pg?view_as=subscriber)
I truly believe that GPU mining has great days ahead with the upcoming forks and new projects like Grin and Beam pledging their commitment to ASIC resistance.
I can provide a live video walkthrough of the facility, client testimonials, or any other information to verify our facility.

So far, I've been managing my rigs manually, switching from one algo to the other when the profitability was worth it. It is working great, but it's a lot of work. Plus, I have to sell on the exchanges, and the withdrawal fees are often high. I've read somewhere also that it may not be efficient to switch algos because of how the pools work.

I've come across auto-switch miners, like AwesomeMiner/MiningPoolHub, and I've given it a try. I was quite disappointed to realize that the auto-switch was not taking into account the most profitable coins these days: Grin, Beam, for example. The results of my tests so far was that AM was less profitable than NH.

So, my question is: if I have time to invest in it and like to do it, is it worth it to manage my rigs by myself?

Power usage is really great on these cards, so at least there is some profit for mining in such tough times for miners. Like some of the other graphic cards even doesn’t cover power costs for mining. This means if you are using these cards , you can stay longer in the game without loosing money. Which is crucial for large mining farms, as we have seen a lot of them shutting down as they cannot cover the power costs.

One my miners have been unsteady for a while. At best times it worked for 24 hours than the computer basically froze and needed hard reset. I'm currently in United States and miner is in Turkey, my dad basically turns them on and off when I ask him to.

I have 3 identical builds of 8x8GB RX 580 rigs with Asus Z270-A and 4 GB Ram on them. We had issues with this particular miner's SSD and therefore switched to a HDD earlier. Since it was 80 GB, the virtual memory was not enough so I added another 250 GB HDD and created a virtual memory on it and the computer now has over 100 GB of virtual memory.

This build worked like a charm for 3-4 weeks with no problem at all, shut downs with once a week or two. But recently (until last weekend) it kinda doesn't stop mining. During phoenixminer (I'm using 4.5c at the moment) optimization, the computer basically freezes, sometimes it works for 3-4 hours, sometimes up to 24 hours but I don't remember seeing the second day for a while.

Today when I connected my miner with Teamviewer, I have seen an error I've never seen in my life. It stated the error code in comment, or I'm adding a screenshot of how I found it.

I have a friend who can help in technical issues but I need to be very precise what I should ask to him. Therefore I would be extremely happy if you can help with solving this weird issue.

I raised the speed by over 1mh/s on each card which was nice, and the power usage didn't change much at all. I do however wish to push this further if possible, because why not? If it crashes, just dial it back, right? As far as I know memory overclocking isn't very harmful compared to overvolting (But that's rare if not unseen in mining afaik too?) but I could be wrong. Should I lower my clocks for safety even though it seems to be fully stable? It's a few days later now and no crash. Just because it's not crashing it doesn't mean things are fine, maybe some other component (VRM or something?) is running very hot due to high memory clock? The cards are in general quite cool, running at roughly 50% fan speed and 45-55C, 3 rigs sharing a big basement.

* 12x NVIDIA P106 GPU
* AsRock BTC+ H110 Motherboard
* 4GB Ram
* Intel Celeron G3930

We compared 5 Grin mining pools, the results as previously discussed were clear that luck plays big factor for PPLNS pools (TheGrinPool, GrinMint) on daily earnings but over time they balance out and will be closer to 100% luck like the PPS pools (Sparkpool, F2Pool)

Fee Structure:

* TheGrinPool — 0.5%
* Sparkpool — 1%
* Grinmint — 2.5%
* F2pool — 3%
* Luxor — 0%

TheGrinPool mined \~6% more than Grinmint and Sparkpool over one month, but only under 1% for F2 and Luxor. Need to investigate how F2 has been competitive while charging the most fees and why PPS pools have such a drastic change in the earnings.

# PPS Pools vs PPLNS Pools

* PPS mining pools do not have luck variable when calculating earnings. You are rewarded for every share your miner submits.
* PPLNS/PPLNG mining pools
* due to low hashrates compared to PPS pools like Sparkpool and F2Pool, luck plays a huge factor in daily earnings for PPLNS/PPLNG pools.
* although low pool hashrates affect daily earnings, over time, the luck balances out to \~100% so over a longer duration, it does not affect earnings as much

**TheGrinPool was more profitable during our testing overall, factors that play into profitability also has to do with pool size, pool hashrate and luck. Although we had several unlucky days, our lucky days balanced out and our total mined GRIN over the same time period was more than the other pools.**

And now my question: How viable is mining with this card today? I'm not seeking maximum profitability obviously as I'm doing this more as a hobby project/on-a-budget tryout, but will I have even a hope of making a little profit from it? If not, which card on the cheaper end of the spectrum would you recommend, and will that particular card affect the motherboard option?

138,Pekka Update,1,d1sgde,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/d1sgde/pekka_update/,0,"Hey Guys,

A lot of you showed interest in our new project Pekka when I announced it last month so I figured I would give you all an update to how Pekka is doing. If you are interested, head on over to our Pekka subreddit or facebook to join in discussions and be the first to get updates.

The first month of Pekka’s alpha launch is coming to an end soon and we couldn’t be happier with how it has played out. We are very excited about the results and user feedback. 

A quick refresher of what I'm talking about. Pekka is a global web service provider that allows users to rent out their GPU or computer resources to anyone in the world. This is mainly for computationally intensive tasks such as machine learning or 3D rendering. Pekka is hosted on a blockchain network. Last month we released the Alpha version and we are looking for participants. We will be releasing the Beta version in December 2019. 

Our announcement post can be found here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/cpg18w/pekka_the_alternative_to_mining_crypto/

Now for the updates:

Pekka now comes with a fully operational automated crypto-mining feature. This allows providers to choose if they want to join a mining pool while their computer waits to be rented out. It will stay in the pool until a customer rents it and once it is done, if there is leftover hosting time, it will automatically join the pool again. This is to guarantee 24/7 earnings even during the downtime in the marketplace. The mining pool won't earn the same profit as renting to a customer, but it is better than making zero profit while waiting. 

Pekka has implemented a Refer A Friend program. This program will allow users to earn an additional 5% of their friend's income every time they rent out their computer. 

We developed a deep learning performance testing algorithm. This algorithm can be used to help users select a machine with desired deep learning performance. 

We further simplify and optimize the smart contract used for machine listing, instance creation, and others. This improvement can significantly reduce the cost of using Pekka.

There is now a way to monetize these by running an ""edge host"", which runs decentralized web-services (CMS, CDN, DNS) and provides storage to customers. Currently there are already over 200 hosts running a Raspberry PI node and earning 20$ monthly on average. Recently, the company behind the edge network has announced self-onboarding, meaning any linux-based device can join and monetize their spare capacity. As mining rigs (typically..) have a higher compute capacity than raspberry PIs, they should be able to make more passive income (and GPU monetization is also on the roadmap).

The process is as follows:
Follow the onboarding instructions: https://edge.network/en/updates/network/edge-network-now-onboarding/.
Also there is stake of 5000 $EDGE tokens ($EDGE on kucoin and idex, still called dadi on okex and CMC) required as a security deposit, however income to the nodes comes from customers buying the web-services, the token is thus non-inflationary. Also register on the telegram for staking instructions (https://t.me/edgenetwork).

155,Issue with newly built miner - 3 Radeon VII GPU's,0,cz17ov,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/cz17ov/issue_with_newly_built_miner_3_radeon_vii_gpus/,9,"Hi there,

So I built my miner with:

* 3 Radeon VII GPU's all mounted on PCIe risers
* Gigabyte B450M S2H motherboard (it has two PCIe x1 slots and one PCIe x16 slot)
* 8GB RAM
* 128GB M.2 Sata SSD
* a Corsair HXi 1200W (it's HXi because I got it at a deal and it was costing the same as an HX at the time)

**The issue is**: it's running fine with **two GPU's**, but not with **three GPU's**. As in, when I put the third PCIe riser in the mobo (with the GPU mounted on it), the miner won't boot at all.  Not only that, but unless I take out the PCIe risers (all three of them) and clear CMOS - it won't boot again.

edit: by ""the miner won't boot at all"", I've meant that I can't enter at all in BIOS when I have the 3rd GPU connected to the mobo via the pcie riser. The system powers up but nothing gets displayed on the monitor.

What I've done so far **to rule out issues**:

1. I've ran any two GPU's in combination (GPU1 with GPU2, GPU2 with GPU3, GPU1 with GPU3) to figure out if a GPU or a PCIe riser was defective. Turns out all GPUs and PCIe risers ar fine.
2. I've removed the M.2 SSD thinking that on some motherboards, if the M.2 slot is occupied it might block a PCIe slot or a SATA port. This was not the case (and it wasn't mentioned in the Motherboard manual as well, still I wanted to test it out)
3. Motherboard is updated with latest BIOS

&#x200B;

**What I'm thinking is left to try out**:

1. put a GPU directly in the motherboard and leave the other two on PCIe risers. I've read somewhere that Vlotage from the PSU might not be enough for the GPUs + risers and some people claimed that they had 6 GPU mining rigs working if 5 GPU's were on risers but the last one was directly mounted in the Mobo. I still need to document myself regarding this as I thought that my PSU must be beefy enough.
2. worst case scenario, replace motherboard only if PSU is not the issue

At the moment, I'm starting work, but this afternoon I'm hoping to try out new solutions.

Until then, if you guys can help me with some advice I'll be quite grateful :)

Have a nice day / evening ahead!

**Update:**

Got home a few hours ago. Tried to plug in one of the GPU's directly in the Pcie x16 slot and this didn't work.

I also tried, as per /u/EthanMiner suggestion to enable **4g encoding** in BIOS, this still didn't solve my issue.

I think, as /u/Danile644 suggested, that if I actually need to reset CMOS after I unplug the GPUs, then it must be a motherboard issue.

I'm out of ideas at this point, so I will order another mobo. Lesson learned, don't cheap out on the mobo, even if I think it has what I need. Obviously the 3 Pcie slots is not the only requirement in this particular situation.

Thank you for all your inputs!

**Update 2:**

Finally solved the mystery.

My second 'better than the first' mobo arrived, made the switch with the previous one ... aaaaaand the issue persisted.

&#x200B;

But later I found out that (this might be the case for Athlon processors, not sure yet) the integrated graphics will fail to launch when a 3rd GPU is installed. It just occurred to me that I was using the iGPU with any two cards, without any issue, but thought I should try moving my HDMI cable from the **Mobo,** to one of the 3 GPUs. This way it finally booted and now my newly built miner runs without any issues.

&#x200B;

Hope this will help anyone going through similar issues.",1567521708.0

I started this Adventure mid-June How much I have mined since then?

29.55 Ethereum

At current prices worth $5,000.

My Electric Bill For June-july was $900 and once fully operational for July-Aug was $1888 For 19Kw. Putting my Electric at .096C/Kw. This will increase to about .10C/Kw due to how PPL has different distributors of power at varying rates. Current rate is at .052C/kw

My Initial investment was $15,000 worth of GPUs. The rest of the equipment I already owned/paid off during 2017/2018. The 20 GTX1660ti's I added on were my friends who decided to get out mining. These were purchased for 4K. with 5 more bought from amazon for $1000(Yes, 200 a piece they were a firesale I caught on amazonwarehouse deals)

Bring my total investment now to $20,000. to Date I have not sold any of my mined Ethereum, instead HODLing it. Using my job to pay the electric bill as much as possible.

Taking in the Electric bill for 2 months (900+1,888=2,788) and what I've mined 29.5 Ethereum(Worth 5K at $172 per 9/2/19) I've Netted $2212 in income putting me about 20,000-2,122= $17,879. Doesn't seem like much, but it's been about 9 weeks. Honestly because of the crashes, down time with rigs being offline for hours, along with initial setup time of 1-month, I've had 2-3 weeks of continual mining with minimal crashes. Additionally price has deflated. Ethereum was reaching new 2019 ATH. We've settled back down, yet Difficulty increased about 2.2T from 1.9T when i started.

My Strategy still stands. HODL as much mined Ethereum as possible and wait for the next big bull-run.

&#x200B;

**What did I learn?**

In my initial plan Claymore just came out with Version 14.5 which allows RX GPUs to run ""Straps"" without having to BIOs mod the cards. This was going to save me time from having to BIOs mod all 140+ GPUs and trying to find the 'right' BIOs for them. Unfortunately that did not go as plan. Using 13x GPUs results in crashes and restarts when applying the STRAP settings. I was never able to figure out the root cause or issue.

Because of that it set me back to trying various BIOs and modding all the GPUs per Memory type, Samsung, Hynix, Elpida. Which cost me couple weeks or crashing, failures, and memory problems. It wasn't until I found SRB BIOs mod one-click worked the best for Hynix/Elpida. PBE Bios worked ok for Elpida, but were awful for the Hynix. PBE worked best for the Samsung memory types.

Due to the nature of RX470's being previously mined with and second hand I've had about 2 fully DOA, and 5 that would crash. In total out of original purchase of 156 RX470 I've sent back/resold 15 that were not able to mine or died.

When getting the farm setup, I found the best way was to use HiveOS initially. Using HiveOS I would flash the GPUs with the BIOs. It will throw off PCI-E Bus errors if any GPUs had faulty risers. Once I confirmed all risers were good, BIOs were flashed, and the rig was mining correctly. I would switch then to Windows/Awesomeminer. Starting with general low overclock of 1100/1950mhz 900mv and adjust from there.

Right now the RX470's are performing on average with RXBOOST 30mh/s-30.5Mh/s with the Samsung Memory performing about 31.5Mh/s. RXBOOST is a big part! Using PhoenixMiner 4.5C + AMDmemtweak one 13x GPU rig can achieve about 400mh/s @ 1700w\~

Yes I run mining farm via Windows and Awesomeminer. 2 reasons, 1) AwesomeMiner is a 1-time pay service. I had originally purchased during 2017/18 for 20 Rigs. 2) Windows allows lower voltage for RX gpus. Hive/SMOS average around 1850w\~ for 13x GPU rig compared to Windows where I can fine tune each card's voltage and achieve 1650-1700w.

P104-100's are excellent mining GPUs, for the right price, I purchased mine around $170\~ a GPU. Using Claymore's strap feature and a healthy overclock the max I can achieve is 43mh/s @ 130w average is about 41mh/s @ 125w. I still have my issues with these GPU in that the miner crashes every couple days. I've lowered overclocks significantly, raised voltage limits. Moved them off windows and on HiveOS. Tried various things. They still crash periodically. Besides replacing entire risers for each rig, basically at loss other than let the miner crash and auto-restart the miner.

RISERS. Risers are the a BIG deal and were one of my sources of main pain and agony. I've spent an extra $400\~ just buying new risers, swapping, testing and replacing. Typically if a rig is crashing or GPU having issues. I ALWAYS replace the riser first. If it continues to crash then I move to locate the GPU. Which unfortunately AMD is easier to solve than Nvidia. AMD GPUs will 'drop' out of mining/crash in the program or in HiveOS

&#x200B;

**Where am I at now?**

Currently I have achieved Semi-stability. I've had to pull out a few RX470s GPUs that were crashing rigs, so I don't have full rigs of 13x RX470's. The longest RX470's I've had run was 15+ days no crashes! I adjust my rigs overclock/Undervolt every 7-days or so. Until I find that perfect sweet spot of no HW error, good overclock and voltage.

Interesting thing to note is that 2-rigs I had left running for 15 days+ with no HW errors between that time, GPU10(in both rigs) both had 600+ HW errors by the 15th day. Unsure if GPU error, miner software error, or windows.

This is Definitely a TIME-INVESTMENT. I run my own farm personally, by myself, with little help from others. At best I taught my friend to restart the rigs(when i was on vacation).  Most nights I'm overwatching my farm and I check on it daily! I've spent countless hours in my mining-farm garage.

After having some general service (silicon change etc) to the GPU, should the mined GPUs perform any less than the gaming ones? In what way does mining actually deteriorates the GPUs?

(need to mention that he then proceeds to pass all my GPUs as all good quality, little he knew that he GPUs where mined for over 16 months constantly)

168,Need help figuring out why number of users is declining,1,cv9bnb,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/cv9bnb/need_help_figuring_out_why_number_of_users_is/,55,"I'm at a loss to explain why the number of customers at the Prohashing mining pool ([https://prohashing.com/](https://prohashing.com/)) has been declining week after week, despite the quality of services provided being higher than ever before.  There is obviously something I'm missing, but I can't figure out what it is, and I was hoping that experienced miners (like those who post here) could help.

Prohashing reached a peak of 180,000 active monthly users in January 2018, and declined to 10,000 in July 2019.  The decline is constant and does not seem to reverse when mining profitability rises.  In fact, the litecoin halving didn't affect scrypt hashrate at all.  What's confusing about this is that about 15,000 hours of work was put into the system since January 2018, and many fewer people are using a much better product.  Compared to last August:

* The mining servers have not been restarted in 10 days, and there have been no share corrections in two months, while crashes and share corrections occurred as often as every day last year
* The website was redesigned and 91% of customers said the new design is superior to the old design.  In a follow-up poll, only 23% of customers said that other pools have a superior web interface
* Google Pagespeed rankings increased from 51 to 87 in the new design.  Bounce rates are at just 36%.  With Google Ads, we can achieve a conversion rate of almost 11% even with untargeted ads
* Coins like EOS, TRON, XLM, USDC, and Tether are now offered for payouts
* The system added portfolio targeting and allows groups to be tracked
* We performed profitability tests and all five of the tests showed that we were 2-5% more profitable than big pools like Slush and Antpool on SHA-256, 1.8% more profitable than Nicehash on GPU algorithms, and 18% more profitable than litecoinpool on scrypt
* The number of support tickets referencing bugs was zero this morning, whereas last year we would get 20 tickets per day regarding payout issues and similar problems

Network hashrate on most algorithms has increased, while our share of hashrate continues to decrease.  One would expect less revenue to be generated with lower prices, which is what happened, but the network hashrate shows that the same number of miners are mining as before, so the number of miners would be expected to remain stable.

I could go on and on with other things on this list, but I had always thought that miners respond to profits and features.  If you provide miners with the highest profits and the most payout coins on a stable server, they should join the pool.  Furthermore, if you improve any product, you would expect that, conditions being roughly equal, there should be more customers.  Yet, prices increased 3x since January and the better product lost customers.

What am I missing that is causing the number of customers to continually decline?  If someone is able to post an in-depth answer that is unique and can point to a specific problem with the business, then I'll consider paying a reward.",1566772999.0

I recently upgraded NIVDIA drivers due to the security vulnerability, and also updated Win10 a bit later.

I hear that newer NVIDIA drivers call on the CPU instead of the GPU for some tasks in various popular miners, and I reverted back to driver version 417.71.

I bought 3 x used Sapphire RX580 Nitro+ a couple of days ago. I've only used nvidias till now but I didnt want to pass the opportunity to buy these as they seemed pretty cheap so still playing with settings and stuff.

Anyway they have 8 + 6 pin power connectors and it was giving me some trouble dealing with cable managements as I have a phobia of using splitters and adapters and stuff like that so I though of trying them with only the 8 pin power connector. To my surprise the cards work fine and mine the same as connecting both 8pin and 6 pin. So I wanted to ask if there is any danger doing this and letting them connected only with 8pin power?!

Also Im veryyy surprised at the temp these cards operate! almost too good to be true. Im using latest adrenaline drivers. Is there any way im getting bad temp readings? For reference I've set the fans static at 40% and when I turn AC on my room they mine at about 53-55 degrees. With no AC they never pass 65 degrees even at the hottest time of the day, and its pretty hot right now! My nvidias are nowhere near these temps.

Just four hours ago,  NENG blockchain base difficulty had massive reset. The base difficulty dropped from 10 to 0.00024414.  The reason was that before yesterday there were large ASIC miners   
( 500 Mh/s to 1 Gh/s big ASIC rigs) mining NENG, they all left with only small ASIC miners remaining.   CPU miners on Cheetah picked up a lot of blocks overnight.  Then this massive reset hit early this morning.    


Right now it is boom time for GPU miners and for big CPU miners.   


Here is last half hour mining rewards counts for my 300 kH/s  Nivida GTX 1050 GPU verses 3 MH/s USB ASIC stick, both are on solo mining NENG:  
GPU:  30 blocks obtained from 10:55am to 11:25am U.S. eastern time - 600,000 NENG in half hour  
small ASIC:  4 blocks during same time -   80,000 NENG in half hour.  


GPU only has 10% hashrate of small ASIC USB stick, but generated 7.5x rewards in half hour.",1565942637.0

I have no issue sharing my method and results to you all. Below is a list essentially of all the straps that many miners have come up with and I have confirmed to work along with my own on top. Alot of this is programming knowledge. You need to understand memory functions, cycles of read and writing of data, and a whole lot of other stuff. I am a college drop out teaching my self finance and computer engineering with crypto. Ive been mining nearly 3 years, and this is tough trust me. 

https://github.com/Eliovp/amdmemorytweak

Steps:

1. Open tweaker and save profile to desktop. Name it whatever.
2. Right click and click edit. You will see all the values.
3. Read carefully every string of values for different straps posted below.
4. Change each according value in the profile you are modding. For now leave voltages alone. Use afterburner or wattman to snag a hold of the power limit. 
5. Crashing is ok just reboot. Cards bios are not physcially modded, just changing the clocks/cycles temporarily via software. (IT IS IMPORTANT to note that usually when they crash you will need to reboot about 2 to 3 times because a thread will get stuck inside one of the graphics cards and continue to draw power even after rebooting once or twice!!!!! THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TESTING. INSURE THE RIG IS AT ITS LOWEST IDLE POWER DRAW TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO THREADS STUCK.

I am thrilled to announce the Alpha Launch of Pekka, a web service provider. Pekka allows users to make money with their computer when they are not using it. Pekka is a platform for you to rent out your computing power to those who need a little extra boost in completing tasks such as 3D rendering or running Machine Learning scripts. These tasks could take hours or even days on weaker computers such as laptops. Using Pekka, they can upload their task, choose your machine, and pay you for its time. We estimate that by providing a powerful computer to the Pekka marketplace can make up to USD50/day! Pekka will be hosted on our very own blockchain network - Canonchain. This enables fast, cheap, and reliable transactions that are vastly superior to the current cloud providers such as Google and AWS.

Then later sold all of the GPUs but kept the other components.  
Recently I picked up 3 RX 570s  and re-built the mining rig with them.  
Current setup is as follows: Intel Celeron G3930, 8GB DDR4, RX 570 Strix \* 3, M.2 SSD, Windows 10, Claymore (old version).  
Total hashrate of 87.3MH/s (29.1MH/s per GPU) and total power draw at the wall of 630W.

Now I can't remember but I am pretty sure I used to get 30.x MH/s per GPU on my old rig and the power draw might have been 610W (for 4 GPUs). Am I forgetting something with the new setup? The power draw seems high. Can my hashrate be improved?

- Video editing (let’s call it 1 hour per day average). 
- Photo editing (1 hr per day)
- Gaming (Also 1hr per day). 

I also just do general computer stuff, but have a laptop I would be able to do most of that on. But still, I’m sure on average I’d do 1-2 hours of tasks like emails, word processing, YouTube, facebook etc in between actual work. 

In other words, I want to use my mining rig for real work 5-6 hours a day. I’m guessing gaming and video editing would stop me from mining. But what about the other stuff? 

Also, the above is the priority. Do I need to set up my mining rig in a way that would compromise all that?

Is my rig likely to break from the constant use? Because the other uses are my livelihood. Should I get a seperate mining rig if I was thinking about doing this? 

Looks like my GPU will be a Radeon VII, but could also end up being a 2080ti. Any thoughts on that? (And also, should I consider 2 cards?)

I’m thinking I’ll go with Bitcoin mining (mostly because at a glance it seems to be performing well again). Good choice, or too hard? Or are the above GPU’s suited to another coin? 

And finally, do PCs and Macs with the same GPU’s hash at different rates?

When I dive into the numbers, I really want those numbers to justify a high end card. It doesn't make sense. Help me see what Im missing?

I have ""FREE"" electricity. Yes, my apt management knows about my rigs. Currently have 2, an 8X 580 and a 6X 1660. Both of those setups were 2 of the better ROI considering the card. I can add 2 more cards to the 1660 build so I might pop in 2 2070 Supers or 2 2080. The cost on those just hold me back. Should I just add 2 1660?

The cost on a 2080 is roughly $600 and you can purchase a 1660 for $230. That's $370 difference in cost. So using WTM and Zcoin as the Bench... a 2080 hits $1.02 compared to the 1660 $0.57 for a daily difference of $0.45 a day.  

What am I missing? Obviously less space used for more return is the best argument. But is that worth the EXTRA 200 days 

Is resale that big of an issue? I assume that I will just run them as long as I can... so not sure resale on the secondary market is a huge consideration. Im not asking what I should do but just trying to understand what Im missing. What would you be doing? What are the other considerations?",1565061431.0

I bought the cards in 2 batches and was mining on the first two for about a week before I had a power connector failure for this daughter board I had (4 PCIe x16 on one board) so I took one and popped in my gaming PC to use in the down time waiting for new risers. I believe the one having the issue is this one, the other one I had put on the F2A55-MLK using the one 16x slot to mine and it worked fine. My gaming PC has windows 10 but the F2A55-MLK is running Windows 7 so I'm thinking maybe windows 10 did something to the bios? Windows 7 won't recognize it (it shows up but you can't access it from any program cause of code 43) so I was thinking of putting it back into my gaming PC to try and flash the bios back maybe?

237,Can you check my work? Building my first rig,1,ckk66i,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/ckk66i/can_you_check_my_work_building_my_first_rig/,34,"Hey ya! I am looking to build a rig that can be plugged into one outlet at home.  Just looking to have a little fun hobby, not trying to set up a farm or anything.  I have read all the guides thoroughly (mainly gpuminingresources.com) and I think I have settled on a proper set up, at least on paper.  I am comfortable with building computers but I am absolutely lost when it comes to the electrical side of things.  thats what I would like you guys to check over; what I have and what I plan to do with my rig so that I dont start any fires in my rig or in my apartment.  

**Power** The breaker in my place has the number 20 on each breaker, so I assume each circuit is rated for 20a.  I have 120V (although the kill-o-watt meter reads 124-125V).  Theoretically such a circuit can support 2400W but I am not trying to start any fires so I based all my calculations on a theoretical limit of 15a x 120v = 1800W.  I will be plugging the rig into a [2 outlet surge protector](https://imgur.com/a/Mwakrf6) plugged into one outlet.  That outlet is on its own circuit with nothing else on the circuit.  There will be two PSUs but there is only one outlet so that is why I got the 2 outlet surge protector. Do I even need a surge protector? Or can I just use a power strip without surge protection?

**PSU** I got two PSUs, EVGA 1300W G2.  This may be a dumb question, but the two PSUs adding up to 2600W doesnt mean they will draw that much power from the wall?  In my first set up I will run 5 GPUs and mobo from one PSU.  But eventually, I would like to run 6 GPUs on each PSU.  

**Mobo** I bought the Gigabyte B250 Fintech which can support up to 13 GPUs since in my finished setup I would like to run 12 GPUs.  I know people say that running 12 GPUs from a single mobo is a nightmare.  What kind of issues arise?  Is it really that bad?  Nevertheless, if I run into issues running 12 GPUs I can always slap another mobo onto my frame and use the other PSU for it.  (As it is, I have a second mobo already.  I bought the B250 Mining Expert but didn't realize it doesn't support 12 nvidia GPUs).  The Gigabyte B250 Fintech mobo has two molex connections on either side of the pcie slots.  When should I plug a molex cable into those?  After installing 1 GPU? 6 GPU? 10+ GPUs?

**GPUs**  I plan on having 12 1660tis.  With 12 running at 90W each, they would all only be consuming 1080W.

**Wiring** I'm a bit limited by the wires that EVGA provided with the PSUs so I can only wire up 5 GPUs currently.  I have each GPU wired up with a 8 pin PCIe cable.  There were only two molex cables so I have 3 risers powered by those 2 molex cables.  And the 6th VGA cable powers two risers via 6 pin power.  I think I have read that its best to power the risers with six pin cables.  Should I use a molex to 6 pin PCIe converter to power the risers?  Eventually when I add a second row of GPUs I plan on using the VGA cables that have both a 8pin and a 6 pin connection to power a gpu and a riser for another gpu right above it.  Is it ok to use one pcie cable to power a gpu and a riser that isn't connected to that gpu? 

**Frame** [This is the frame my father and I built](https://imgur.com/a/OVEShmm).  It was a pain the ass to plan out and build this thing and took so many hours.  And the materials were like 60-70% the cost of a prebuilt one.  Tbh I will never recommend anyone try and build their own, just buy a prebuilt one.  

[Here is the progress I have with 6 GPUs set up (only 5 GPUs plugged in)](https://imgur.com/a/gYy54em).  I haven't turned it on yet because I wanted to make sure everything is fine before I fry anything.

Aynthing that i have done wrong?  Will it cause any electrical issues to either my pc components or the wall circuitry?",1564666779.0

I've a workstation with multiple nvidia cards that always mine when I'm not gaming or mine on the non-gaming cards when I am  .  I also use it to test the updates before allowing the mining rigs to also update, they're always on 'update hold'.  The workstation has a main card and two cards on risers.

Win10 1903 has been running fine on all the machines and then I decided to allow the July 26 2019 update to be applied on the workstation/gaming machine.  After which only the main card and only one of the riser graphics cards could be found.  A normal nvidia reinstallation of 431.60 failed to find all the cards, windows was convinced it only had two cards no matter what I tried, I failed to convince it otherwise.

My solution was to shutdown, disconnect the riser cards, reboot and let the nvidia installer do a full uninstall and install, which then found the main card.  I then reinstalled each riser card individually from each other, which the system was able to recognize. With a final reboot that had all the cards connected, the system was then able to find all the cards.

Sigh, since it's a dual boot system, I have to do it all over again since the alt boot also has the same problem after updating that one, and that one is a minimum os I keep for emergency fixes.

I want to switch to Linux, but the algo-switching that Nicehash provides, and the fact that it automatically pays out in BTC every day, is something I really don't want to give up. Between my job and other responsibilities, I don't have time to continually switch between coins and such. I just want to mine the most profitable coin, convert it to BTC, and hold the BTC.

Is there a way to do anything close to this on Linux? I have no problem with Linux itself, as I've used it for a number of other projects and am pretty comfortable with it.

There is a fair amount of complexity to the canonical bitcoin implementation that didn't strike me as strictly necessary. It makes understanding and working with the protocol difficult. I had some time recently, so I finally decided to implement what I thought was the simplest version of bitcoin that could exist. cruzbit is what I ended up with.

Project: https://github.com/cruzbit/cruzbit

In addition to simplicity, I wanted everything I used to be standard. I wanted an average developer to be able to run cruzbit and immediately start working with the protocol and talking to their client.

Highlights:

* Newer crypto: Ed25519 and SHA3
* Simplified transaction format: No inputs/outputs. No scripts.
* No UTXO: Account-model, but as far as I can tell, a novel simpler approach to it. No serial per-account nonce.
* No fixed block size limit: A variation of BIP 101 is implemented.
* Reference implementation is in Go. Completely new code base.
* Web/dev-friendly peer protocol: secure WebSockets and JSON for all protocol messages and primitives.

No premining or any of that funny business. The memo field of the coinbase transaction of the genesis block is timestamped with the bitcoin blockchain's tip block hash at the time of its creation. The client currently has built-in support for mining with ~~Nvidia~~ ALL GPUs (now has CUDA and OpenCL support.) The network has been up for just over a month.

Any/all feedback is much appreciated. Would love to have some new miners join us. Take it easy!

247,Best Mining Pool Options - And Why?,1,ci66u0,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/ci66u0/best_mining_pool_options_and_why/,10,"Look. I get it. The title could send this thread in a disaster of a conversation. I looked pretty extensively in this Sub and didnt find what I was looking for.. and honestly not sure Im going to get much but negativity. Ive read a bunch of articles on this subject. They feel like they are mostly empty reads, just explain what a pool is

So here is the main premise. Ive been on a few different Mining Pools for **ETC** in the last 6 months. The one Ive stayed with the most was meeting my projected numbers consistently. So when it was projecting $5.00 a day, then it made $5.00 a day. In the past 3 weeks its been cut in half. So sticking with the projected to make $5.00 a day, its now only making $2.50 a day. My rig still is at the same rate it has been.  **Why would I all of a sudden get half the projected return?** 

What pool should I look for?  

Should I just try a bunch of different ones for a benchmark? Has anyone already done that ground work?

Maybe better yet, can someone explain the theory behind selecting the correct pool for each person?

You can say which pool you prefer if you want. Not what Im really looking for but if you make a solid argument then Im all ears for a sales pitch lol. 

Ive looked into  [https://miningpoolstats.stream/ethereumclassic](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ethereumclassic)  But Im not sure which I should be looking at.

I used an 8pin Y-splitter on two of those cables to give me 8x 8pin connectors. I have 8x GTX 1060's on this rig with 1x 8pin connector to each card. This has been working fine for the last 18 months. I recently read somewhere that you should only use 1x 8pin PCIE cable per GPU without splitting them. Is this setup safe or do I have a potential fire hazard here? The cards pull 100watts each so the cables that I split are carrying 200watts.   


The reason I went with 1060's is because they only require 1x 8pin PCIE to power them and I can only pull \~1200watts from the wall outlet before the breaker trips (also they were on sale and basically only thing in stock). I'm in an old apartment building and I have 1200watts available on the dining room breaker and 1200watts available on the living room breaker.

Is going the route of 8x 1660's the best option due to the limited power? Would it be better to go with a beefier card like (1/2)070 or (1/2)080 series which would require twice as many PCIE connectors since they typically take 2x 8pin PCIE. If I were to go with beefier cards how should I power them and how many would I be able to squeeze on the Corsair HX1200 PSU?

**GTX 1660 TI** is gonna spend only **90 Watts** per GPU and if there will be a fork to progpow its gonna be advantage for me. But this gpu costs **225€** in my country.

**RX 570** is much cheaper with **125€** but is gonna draw **130 Watts** per GPU. What do you think, what would be smarter? Is there any good update on the progpow-story? I only found posts from Jan, Feb... nothing new.",1562904163.0

I'm currently just experimenting with a single 2080 Ti on claymore and getting around 55mh/s. My electricity is around 0.18cents (USD) so not exactly cheap but it could be worse. 

My current PC is a 4670k, 12gb ram and I'm planning to do a whole system overhaul to the 3950x/3900x which means I will have my 4670k, motherboard and so on still available. It would mean I would not require a new SSD, GPU, RAM if I were to start a mining rig. Though I realise this is a few hundred dollars savings at most upfront. My motherboard is a Gigabyte Z87x D3H with 1;16x, 1;8x, 1;4x, 3;1x slots which would mean I'm able to put up to 6 GPU's in I believe. Cooling isn't an issue as I'd leave the rig downstairs which typically stays under 22c (72f) even in summer when it's around 35-40c outside.  Good ventilation and plenty of windows. 

Running the numbers, 580's wouldn't return enough. Radeon 7's return $7 a day but are around $1000 per card. The resell on the 7's would be far better though. With my prices, would I be better off giving up and just buying BTC instead? I was looking for something passive and effortless as opposed to day trading. Just some thoughts. Looking for some input but from what I'm seeing, it's not a good line of profit but with crypto seemingly rising back up it got me curious.

I realize that the Super cards are coming out around the next year... and I'm not in a hurry to purchase a brand new RTX series card right now, but I wanted to glean some information around the improvement in hash I could see by, for example, buying an RTX 2070 or RTX 2080, and whether or not the consensus is that the super series would be more beneficial to hash rates.

My problem is the 6Gb vram of the 1660ti, i think it's not future proof to get our invest back and keep mining with it for some year. My second problem is the ether algo switch witch people are talking about.

My friend wants to wait for the new RTX super because they got 8gb vram and they a bit better than the no super version.

I bought something like $200 of btc and tried trading to see how it essentially worked. I got me some alts but mainly traded bitcoin. In retrospective, I was pretty dumb and lost a bunch. Didn't fully understand the market and couldn't get profit neither when shorting or longing (also lost like a hunnid on margin trading). I then just kinda forgot about it for some time

&#x200B;

Then a couple colleagues explained to me what mining actually is after i told them I was curios about crypto. I started doing research and found out that it's pretty easy even for a beginner. Of course you need proper tech (especially a good gpu) and at least some tech background, but it's nothing to be scared of. I learned more from Youtube [this video from 3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4) but there are many others you can find, just search blockchain) and my friend answered other stupid questions I've had about mining.

&#x200B;

So what exactly is my point? I think that many cryptoenthusiasts tend to forget about mining while caring too much for trading. I mean, look at it this way:

&#x200B;

\-You stay anonymous because you don't have to directly exchange dollars for btc

\-You don't support the big players and do your own thing which makes it all more decentralized in the end

\-you have financial independence (no need to pay for fees/gas/currency conversion)

And it's also cheaper. I found out that if you spend a 15 hundred on your own beginner rig, you'll get a stable and resellable profit machine. It's good to know what you're doing but thereare communities like reddit who would help you

&#x200B;

[Here's a post](https://np.reddit.com/r/MoneroMining/comments/8ni6i0/mining_vs_buying_crypto_an_opinion/) on /r/moneromining on mining vs buying crypto

&#x200B;

[Also a good read about different cases when buying and mining](https://np.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/a92uqx/mining_vs_buying_crypto_everyone_is_missing/)

&#x200B;

It's also a great way to escape scammers cos as I said you don't have to deal with shady people who can easily steal your money which is pretty bad especially if crypto is outlawed in your country. It's safer than exchanges (as we all know judging by how many scams there were with fraudulent exchanges).

If you have a good rig you really invested in you can always resell it or use its' power for yourself (video/photo/music production or just playing games on it).

&#x200B;

Buying crypto doesn't help this industry as mining and developing new solutions does. Many people buy and hodl while hoping for a bright future or try to trade while losing money every day.

And last but not least: It doesn't require your attention every minute of the day. It's more useful than holding because you continue to actively make money but it's much less stressful than trading.

You can try mining on your pc rn because you only need a good pool. I started with Nicehash (pretty good marketplace but cloudmining is not my thing) and Minergate (dead simple when it comes to mining). Bitcoin is not really profitable so maybe try ethereum classic or Monero, depending on your setup. Mind the heating issues (get a fan) and electricity costs. If you have any questions you can ask around here or pm me

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

Mining is better when it comes to anonymity and making stable money in the long run. It's safer and there's less chance you get scammed. See my examples above",1562281159.0

But it's been about two weeks of banging my head against the wall with no progress.  So I've decided to finally lean on the community and see if they have any insight!

I've got two mining rigs I am running via smos.  Miner01 has eight nVidia 1070s and seems to be running as expected (well, except for the one time that some power cables burnt out.  That was scary).  Miner02 has eight AMD rx580s and not doing quite as well.

Here is a [picture of Miner2's dashboard](https://imgur.com/a/FzqAqoE).  As you can see, cards 0 through 2 are not getting their clocks set up properly and are running at under 5MH/s each.  Cards 3 through 7 have their overclocking setting driven correctly and are getting 25-30 MH/s each.  Here [is a picture of the overclock settings for Miner2](https://imgur.com/a/NSgs9ar).  Nothing looks concerning to me, but obviously, I must be missing something or else it would be working correctly.

My parents allows me to mine for free since electricity is cheap here. But only up to a certain threshold.

> What SINOVATE is  aiming on Cryptocurrency Market?

SINOVATE is created for Innovation and it aims to keep bringing never before seen Innovations in the crypto market.

What is Infinity Nodes, why different from Classical Masternode System?
Infinity Nodes are groundbreaking evolved masternodes that solves the inflation problem. Traditional masternodes start with high ROI but with very large inflation and that inflation is what inevitably makes them fail.

> What is IDS, why is it better than cloud storage? And size providers how to get/ earn SIN?

IDS = Incorruptible Data Storage.

IDS is a peer-to-peer private networking system, which will permit transactions and storage between miners and Infinity Node owners. Competitors including Sia, Storj, BitTorrent and even IPFS solutions reward individuals for serving and hosting content on their hard drive space, which requires a 24/7 uptime for computers. User hard drives must remain open and the rewards received must justify the costs incurred for leaving computer online.

In IDS, the private networking of decentralized storage relies solely on the SINOVATE Blockchain, with only node owners receiving rewards as compensation for utilising their hard drive resources to run an Infinity Node. Node owners will get rewards both from the Infinity Nodes and from storing confidential data.

IDS will have 5 steps of evolution.

* Step 1. DataSend. Users will be able to send documents and SMS only data between SIN wallets, just like sending their coins up to 1.5 Megabytes (MB).
Two sending options will be provided to users, known as legal (256-bit) and illegal (1024-bit or higher).
Data being sent in 256-bit will only be accessible by governments for decryption. However, data will still be indestructible for enterprise use.
Data being sent in 1024-bit or higher will be impossible to decrypt even for governments, should this option be chosen.
* Step2. Addition of voice and video data up to 3MB.
* Step3. Increase space
* Step4. Increase data storage
* Step5. Unlimited blockchain based storage for eliminating centralized storage all over the world.

> SINOVATE has 533 tp/s. How are you planning to use this as a use case? 

Scalability is one of the biggest problems in cryptocurrencies. POS only or centralized cryptocurrencies have higher scalability but are not suitable for the original Satoshi plan.
Satoshi Nakamoto’s dream was everybody to mine their own coins without being centralized so SINOVATE blockchain not only is the most scalable POW cryptocurrency but will also have much more increased scalability in the future. Mass adoption requires high scalability especially when it will be used in real life as a payment means.
Are we going to see SINOVATE Payment System in the future?

SINOVATE payment gateway will be released this year with high scalability and less than 3 seconds transaction times with the help of FlashSend.

> What is SINOVATE aiming with X25X Algorithm? 

SINOVATE formerly SUQA always aimed at the ordinary user starting with the X22i custom algorithm and upgraded to X25X to fight the big hardware companies so everyone can mine their own coin without letting ASIC,FPGA companies dominate the network.

[Algo Comparison Chart](https://imgur.com/Mlc2qjE)

We are committed to remaining ASIC / FPGA resistant and such use an ever evolving algorithm, the latest variation named X25X launched with the last update.  It is protected from difficulty attacks using Dark Gravity Wave v3 and raises the memory requirements compared to X22i bt a factor of five making it harder for ASIC / FPGA to implement. 

> What is Komodo dPOW , and when is the plan implementation on SINOVATE?

[dPoW diagram](https://imgur.com/xDS0Gjm)

KOMODO DPoW is a working and trusted 51 % Attack protection technology to prevent any kind of malicious attacks by the help of notarized data of Bitcoin, KOMODO and SINOVATE chain.

> What is the current status on mobile wallets? We saw a mobile wallet trailer.

Mobile wallets will be released in July 2019 as a custom good looking wallet tailored to the specific needs of SIN Blockchain

> What is the plan for adoption in real life SINOVATE?

Our team draws from a large diversity of skills from many areas of business and across many different industries. This allows us to design and hone the experience of interacting with the SINOVATE Blockchain at many levels, from developers, business leaders and operational levels, down to the end-user experience.

This allows us to develop software and user experiences from the perspective of all involved, ensuring that the end user is the primary focus.

> What is the current financial status on SINOVATE?

SINOVATE are transparent about the financial status of the foundation and the activity taken with funds.  We regularly publish updates and the latest one for June is [here.](https://medium.com/@sinovatechain/financial-statement-550e2745c4e)

> What partnerships will there be in the future?

Besides the Masternodes related partnerships, SINOVATE partnered with KOMODO for the integration of dPoW 51% attack protection, which will be active at the end of July or early August 2019.

As the foundation’s mission is to grow the space for all. We are happy to work with all projects and businesses both by learning from the great work others have undertaken and offering something back to other projects with our open source code.

> With Governance what can it  do for the community?

Decentralized governance is the future of any successful blockchain project, SINOVATE believes that blockchain will be ubiquitous in the underlying infrastructure and services in the future of everyday life. Having fair voting for developments, marketing and innovations of the SINOVATE chain will be very important for everyone.

The first one I used connected to a Red Devil 580 8gig. Now that GPU needs 2 8pins. I took both of them from the converter. I also did not undervolt it so it was probably pulling about 200 watt. After a couple of days the connector cought fire. 
Now, my question is, was the issue a crappy quality connector, did I overload it or is it just absolutely stupid to power a gpu with an eps12v?

363,GPU Mining Crash Course - START HERE!,38,c5cwgn,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/c5cwgn/gpu_mining_crash_course_start_here/,46,"Welcome All to the GPUMining Crash Course!

With the increase in prices in cryptocurrency, a lot of people are getting back into mining and a lot of people are brand new to the concept overall. So, I quickly wrote this crash course to help you understand what to expect and how to successfully mine your first cryptocurrency. This crash course isn't gonna have all of the fluff you'd see in a normal publication. This is just everything you need to know to get up and running on your first cryptocurrency mining rig.

# What is cryptocurrency mining?

One of the main things about cryptocurrencies is that they are ""decentralized"". Sounds great, but WTF does that even mean? Well, the easiest way to explain it is...

You know how if you want to send your friend/family money digitally, you can do so through your bank. Your bank likely takes a transaction fee and in a few days they will transfer the money. Since cryptocurrencies are decentralized, they don't have a bank or organization to fulfill the transfer of money. Instead, they outsource the computing power of their cryptocurrency network to miners (soon to be you). These miners are verifying transactions, securing the blockchain, and powering the cryptocurrency's specific network among other things. As an incentive, the miners collect transaction fees on the transactions that they verify and collect block rewards while new currency is still being introduced into the ecosystem.

# What kind of rig should I build?

You can mine cryptocurrencies using your CPU, GPU, FPGA, or ASIC, but this is a GPU Mining subreddit, so I will cater this to GPUs.

For building a great all-around GPU rig, there are two models of GPUs that I'd recommend:

* [GTX 1070ti](https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Scanner-Graphics-08G-P4-5671-KR/dp/B076S4RH6K/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=GTX+1070ti&qid=1561482432&s=gateway&sr=8-2) 

* [GTX 1660ti](https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Gaming-Graphics-06G-P4-1261-KR/dp/B07N9XNC1B/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=GTX+1660ti&qid=1561482458&s=gateway&sr=8-3)

Both of these GPUs have solid hashrates across most mining algorithms and for a decent price! You should be able to find both of these kinds of GPUs used for around $200-$250 each, which is a great price if you know what happened during the last mining craze! ($200 GPUs were out of stock everywhere and people were reselling them for $600+ each)

There are also plenty of great AMD GPUs for mining, but I've worked mostly with Nvidia so that's why both of my recommendations are Nvidia and not AMD.

Other parts to your rig that you'll need are listed below. Most of these can be pieces of crap and are just needed to make the rig actually run, but the one spot you DON'T want to cheap out on is the power supply unit. A decent power supply unit will keep your home from burning down while also keeping your rigs up and running smoothly. Here are my recommendations:

* [Motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-GA-Z270P-D3-LGA1151-Crossfire-Motherboard/dp/B01N2V0AHI/ref=sr_1_1?crid=35IOFIVJZW3A7&keywords=gigabyte+z270p-d3&qid=1561483483&s=gateway&sprefix=Gigabyte+z270p%2Caps%2C180&sr=8-1) - This Motherboard can hold up to 6 GPUs (considered a full rig) with the use of risers. It is decently priced and will fit nearly any mining rig upgrades that you make in the future.

* [CPU](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-BX80662G3900-Celeron-2-80Ghz-LGA1151/dp/B01B2PJRPA/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Intel+Celeron+G4900&qid=1561483681&s=gateway&sr=8-2) - You really just need the most basic CPU you can find, it's not very essential to mining unless you're CPU mining, but even then... CPU mining isn't very profitable for how expensive CPUs can be.

* [RAM](https://www.amazon.com/Patriot-Memory-Signature-1x4GB-Frequency/dp/B074Q1R8TB/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=2RJ975276UEZI&keywords=4gb+2400mhz+ddr4&qid=1561483794&s=gateway&sprefix=4GB+2400%2Caps%2C173&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1) - All you really need is about 4GB to keep this thing running. If you want more, go for it, but it's not neccessary in most cases.

* [Power Switch](https://www.amazon.com/Desktop-Computer-Supply-Supplies-Button/dp/B01CJ44XZM/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Computer+on%2Foff+switch&qid=1561483850&s=gateway&sr=8-5) - Doesn't need to be fancy, just needs to turn the thing on and off

* [PowerSupply](https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-Supernova-120-G2-1300-XR-ATX12V-EPS12V/dp/B07GZSZDDC/ref=sr_1_10?crid=5M8FSGTRSDMH&keywords=evga+1300w+g2&qid=1561483935&s=gateway&sprefix=EVGA+1300w%2Caps%2C173&sr=8-10) - Don't cheap out here! Pay for a quality PSU and save yourself the headache and be safe with a solid PSU. Get a GOLD quality PSU at a MINIMUM! Platinum is good too, but probably unnecessary. The linked 1300w PSU will support most 6 GPU rigs, if you're going for higher tier GPUs like a 1080ti and above or if you're having more than 6 GPUs on a single rig then you'll need something stronger.

* [GPU Risers](https://www.amazon.com/Ubit-Express-Graphics-Extension-Ethereum/dp/B076KLJR2Y/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=gpu+risers&qid=1561484067&s=gateway&sr=8-3) - I use this kind. They work and they're not shitty. They do require 6pin for power. Use a Molex converter if needed, but going 6pin directly from your PSU is best. Your 8+6pin will probably be a little bit short, so you'll need some 6pin extenders. EVGA will sell them you for a few bucks each, but you have to call as they're not listed on the site. DON'T YOU DARE THINK OF USING A SATA CONNECTION UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR ENTIRE MINING OPERATION TO BURN DOWN AND TAKE EVERYTHING ELSE WITH IT! SATA IS NOT RATED FOR THE POWER THAT YOU NEED!!!! 

* [Kilowatt Meter](https://www.amazon.com/P3-P4400-Electricity-Usage-Monitor/dp/B00009MDBU/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3AAVNUAH2FHV1&keywords=killawatt+meter&qid=1561484226&s=gateway&sprefix=killawatt%2Caps%2C176&sr=8-3) - So that you can monitor your power consumption from the wall (much more accurate than trying to calculate each piece of hardware individually). Also helps when overclocking for a higher efficiency.

* [120GB Solid State Drive](https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-120GB-Solid-SA400S37-120G/dp/B01N6JQS8C/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=120GB+ssd&qid=1561484310&s=gateway&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1) - SSDs are pretty damn cheap now. Just get it instead of your prehistoric HDD. Also, make sure you get AT LEAST 120GB! Many of the popular cryptocurrencies like BEAM and GRIN will demand quite a bit of virtual memory, so you'll need the extra space on your SSD to compensate for that.

* [Something to put your rig on](https://www.amazon.com/AAAwave-Stackable-Aluminum-Bitcoin-Ethereum/dp/B074KWF4SD/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=GPU+Mining+Case&qid=1561484600&s=gateway&sr=8-4) - This one seems to be popular, but pretty much anything will do. I literally used a shoe rack and zip ties. You just need something that will give the GPUs airflow to breathe and keep the rig organized as a whole.

* Windows 10/Linux Operating System - Pretty self explanatory here. Don't go with any of the MAC OS or Apple Products. They're extremely over priced and nearly useless in the mining world.

# She's built, now what?

Now you need to do a few things. I am a Windows miner, so I will be speaking to Windows here:

1. Update Windows - Do all of the updates. Just do it.
2. Update Drivers - Go to the EVGA website and download GeForce experience. It will keep your GPU drivers up to date.
3. Go to Windows Device Manager and make sure all of your GPUs show up under ""Display Adapters"". If it is there, but it isn't showing the Name/Model of the GPU as the name, right click it and select ""Update Driver"". This should fix it.

Assuming you've done all of this, you're ready to download a mining application.

# Mining Software

There are tons to choose from! Claymore, Phoenix, EWBF, LolMiner, etc... It can be overwhelming pretty quickly since they all have different algorithm support, speeds, efficiencies, and a whole lot more. On top of that, in order to get them running you need to set up batch files to call the proper exe, point you to the correct pool, and a whole bunch of other stuff that can be confusing to a new user. Not to mention, you will probably need a separate miner, config file, batch file, etc. for each different algorithm that you're interested in mining on.

Instead, I recommend that you download a miner management software that will take care of most of this tedious work for you. There are a few in the sidebar, but the /r/GPUMining favorite is [AIOMiner](https://aiominer.com/). It was developed by our very own community member, /u/xixspiderxix with the intention of making mining as easy as possible to do and without any fees. It supports over 100 different algorithms, so you'll be able to mine nearly ANY cryptocurrency you'd like. Just download it from their website and it will take you through a quick tutorial to help you get set up! You can also connect your rig to their website for remote monitoring and control. You've probably seen a few of their posts around this subreddit.

Other Windows mining softwares include:

* MOAMiner
* AwesomeMiner
* WinMiner
* many more you can find from google searching

**Note: Many mining softwares have fees built into them. Most are around 1%, but can go as high as 5% or greater! You want a mining software with little or no fees at all so that you get to keep as much cryptocurrency as possible. These fees aren't something you actively pay, the software will automatically take it by mining on the developers behalf for a given amount of time and then switching back to mining on your own behalf. So, please be diligent in the software that you evaluate and make sure it is reputable.**

# I keep hearing about NiceHash. What is that?

The asshole of the mining industry. Jk, but not really.

NiceHash is a software program that allows you to sell your rig's hashing power to someone on their marketplace. They market themselves as profitable mining, but you're not really mining. You're selling your power in exchange for Bitcoin.

They did a great job telling people that with them, you're always mining the most profitable coin, but that's just not true. Since it is a mining marketplace, they make you mine whatever their most expensive contract is. If their contracts are below market prices, then you're not operating as efficiently and profitably as you could be.

NiceHash also has a sketchy history, which continues to this day. In 2017, they were hacked and lost $65M worth of Bitcoin. No one got paid out for MONTHS and many of their executives conveniently resigned. Their platform is also used to destroy cryptocurrencies. Since people are able to purchase mining power on their platform, people have used their platform to purchase enough mining power to control individual cryptocurrencies and duplicate coins, which increased the malicious user's wealth while completely destroying the integrity of the coin's blockchain. HoriZEN (formerly ZenCash), Ethereum Classic, and many other great cryptocurrencies have been the victim of NiceHash's platform.

For this and many other reasons, we highly recommend that you stay AWAY from Nicehash. We understand that it is extremely easy to use and you get paid in bitcoin, but they are destroying the industry with their greed and lack of motivation to change their platform for the protection of cryptocurrencies.

# Concluding Thoughts

This is pretty much everything you need to know to get started. We covered the hardware, setting up the software, which software to use, and [AIOMiner's](https://aiominer.com/) tutorial will get you up to speed on how to actually mine the cryptocurrency that you want better than I can explain it, so I'll leave that part to them.

Rig was working perfectly, but I had to go away for a few days. So I shut the rig off, disconnect everything from power outlets and stay away from home 4 to 5 days.

No video at all coming out of the onboard DVI, no beeps from the speaker, nothing.

Now, the first time this happened in exactly the same way, I ended up finding it was the CPU that had died. Managed to RMA it, but now my warranty has expired so I'm SOL there. Guess my question is, could my motherboard be killing my CPU **while powered off**? Anybody had similar experiences?

This version makes substantial improvements to nearly every area of the miner (detailed below.) 

Requires: 1 or more nVidia (CUDA) GPU, any 64-bit CPU (>2 threads recommended), any 64-bit Windows version (Windows 7 should work, but developed for Windows 8.1 and up.) *Remember to install the latest nVidia graphics drivers*

Supports Mining: 0xBitcoin, KiwiToken, S.E.D.O., (standalone or merge-mined with 0xBTC), CatEther(0xCATE), Bitcoin Classic Token (on the Ethereum Classic network), LiraPay, CryptoPepes (mining 'rat-race' now over), and many other ERC-918 token varieties!

**Important Note: Now built against CUDA v10.1+Update1, so it is strongly recommended that you update your nVidia graphics drivers. (It is NOT necessary to install the CUDA toolkit)**


FEATURES:


- Written in C/C++-CLI and CUDA C/PTX assembly, Inspired by 0xBitcoin-Miner/GpuMiner

- Mining on multiple nVidia CUDA devices/cards in one instance, auto-detected

- High-Performance Keccak hashing kernel (nicknamed: ""Hashburner"")

- Mines with CUDA Devices and sends results to TokenPools (Solo Mining coming Next Update!)

- Fully-integrated Graphical User Interface for Windows 64-bit (Intended to make Token Mining easier for newcomers)

- All settings can be configured in the GUI (no manual config editing or batch files required!)

- Integrated Hardware Temp/Fan/Power Monitoring and Safety Features

- Faster, more efficient and lower CPU/RAM use than COSMiC V3.4 and the classic 0xBitcoin-miner

- Aims for very few stale Shares at the Pool level and verifies GPU-found solutions on the CPU

- Improved Network code for stability, fault-tolerance, potential power savings

- Multi-Threaded for optimal performance on CPUs with numerous cores/threads

- Small Application Size, Minimal Memory Footprint


CHANGES THIS VERSION:


- Streamlined ""end"" of keccak function, with less load/store operations: don't store state elements that will not be accessed again (observed significant performance uplift)

- ""Hashburner"" profiled/refactored/tweaked for improved performance on Turing (probably also Volta)-based GPUs (and previous). Observed significant performance uplift on tested GTX1660 graphics card vs. v4.1.2. Initial optimizations only, expect further hashrate gains in subsequent updates.

- Rebuilt/linked against newest LibCurl release (v7.65.1)

- Overzealous ""RPM Pause"" bug fixed, along with some UI inconsistencies

- Minimize to System Tray/Notification Area icon (with summary tooltip)

- More robust GPU context (Right-click) menu with config separated into categories, including GPU Summary/Statistics, Set Intensity and CUDA engine selection

- UI update speed now selectable in Options menu

- Added ""Compatibility"" CUDA engine. More conservative Keccak hashing function, intended for use on older (Kepler-and-newer) GPU architectures or certain mobile chips

- Streamlined 'outer' mining kernel and launch code: performance uplift and consistency improvement observed

- NET annunciator now indicates OK/any network error, last request latency and is colorized to indicate network/pool-related errors

- SQ annunciator added (shows # of queued-to-send solutions on Mouseover if there is a network delay). (see *2 in docs/WHATSNEW for more info).

- Interruption Prevention: Can attempt to keep Windows from shutting off display or suspending (User-configurable, off by default). Attempts to prevent automatic restarts by other programs/Windows.

- Various UX (user experience) improvements- let me know your thoughts :)

- Optimizations for reduced CPU use (observed avg 0.1-0.6% total utilization on Ryzen 5 1600 @ 3.8 GHz). Note: COSMiC is highly multi-threaded for improved performance on modern multi-core and SMT-supporting processors.

- Modified hashing helper functions to reduce register pressure and increase device occupancy, minimize number of instructions wherever possible. New permutation helper functions added

&#x200B;

I did extensive testing and now I'm 1 step away from buying a new PSU tomorrow, unless you guys give me another solution I could test.

&#x200B;

OS: HiveOS

Rig: X11 1080Ti

PSU: 4 PSUs

&#x200B;

Long story short, took apart the rig, did some summer cleaning, blew the cards, put it back in. 2 cards suddenly not recognized by the OS. The cards get power, spin the fans and LEDs. The only thing that happens is that they do not stop the fans when the OS boots up which is a signal the OS sees the card and will spin them up when the heat rises.

&#x200B;

I did extensive testing

&#x200B;

\- Risers are functional

\- Tried plugging a working card into the ""bad PSU"" - it doesn't work

\- Tried a different PSU from another rig, the cards got back online. At this point I realize the PSU is to be blamed, I send it to the store, they test it out with 2 1080Ti's in a PC - worked fine they say and gave it back.

\- Tried plugging the missing cards into one of the PSU's I have, it worked.

\- Tried a new HiveOS installation

\- Tried running with just the 10th missing card.

\- Tried running ONLY a card from the ""broken PSU"", it doesn't see it again, that eliminates the ""too many cards"" problem.

&#x200B;

Conclusion: PSU is somehow broken, not sure how because it gives them power.

Seeking Advice/Help,1,c1mrbe,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/c1mrbe/hitting_a_sanfu_with_claymore_strap_function/,5,"Hey all, so picked up a bunch of used RX470's, but I cannot get the newest Claymore 14.6 STRAP function to work without crashing. Unsure what's causing it. Now there is a bit of a caveat Since these were used some cards were BIOs modded others left stock. I put whatever was BIOs modded back to stock from other GPUs that were stock, however, I noticed in windows that quite a few GPUs have the 'ERROR 43' in windows which can only be fixed by applying the ATIpixel patcher.

Setup:

13x Rx470 4GB (Stock BIOs)(Hynix, Samsung, Elpida)

Asrock H110 Pro BTC+

G3930/4GB RAM/EVGA 450w PSU (for motherboard)

Delta 2400w Server PSU (For GPUs)

Windows 10 (1903)

AMD 19.5.1 Drivers

&#x200B;

Now when I tested the STRAP function with a single card, works fine. Will launch and I'm seeing good hash rates of 31mh/s\~. However, when I plug in all 13x 470's try the STRAP feature, it will get to 2nd GPU applying STRAPs then Windows will crash and restart itself. This happens every time without fail.  Now if I only apply it GPU 0 the STRAP then works fine again, however applying it to GPU 0 and GPU 1 it will hard crash and restart windows.  Trying GPU 0 and GPU 2 results in the same thing. Also, note that RXBOOST works perfectly fine. The cards will hash fine with stock BIOs or even Modded BIOs using RXBOOST.

&#x200B;

So Far I've tried

Raising voltages for Core/Memory or just leaving it stock. Doesn't matter.

Updating Microsoft .net framework and C++Flashing various Stock BIOs(found online) and even Modded BIOs.

Different Windows versions 1809 vs 1903.

&#x200B;

Thanks

&#x200B;

Update: tested each card one at the time, when I get to the 5th card STRAP function works fine. However when I plug in the 6th card that's when it crashes loading STRAPs. regardless of what GPU I use/plugin it crashes.

&#x200B;

Note this only happens to AMD. The STRAP feature for Nvidia card I have works flawlessly.

&#x200B;

Update 2: I tried an entirely different rig(same setup but with different GPU memory type) the same problem still crashing.

408,My speculation on Radeon Navi 5700 mining performance,6,c0otri,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/c0otri/my_speculation_on_radeon_navi_5700_mining/,35,"Today I was thinking about the performance, price and power usage of AMD's new Navi video cards. Here are my thoughts:

&#x200B;

Nowadays mem bandwidth is really important for GPU mining, so let's start there. The memory bandwidth of both the Navi 5700 XT and 5700 nonXT is 448 GB/s at stock mem clocks.

It doesn't sound that great compared to existing GPUs: the Vega 56 has 410 GB/s, the Vega 64 has 512 GB/s, and the beast Radeon VII has 1024 GB/s of BW. So you would expect that the new Navi 5700 XT gets \~47 Mh/s just like the Vega 64, after all mods. But the RDNA architecture has a special L1 cache or something, so I expect the memory to perform a little better than just the raw BW indicates.

I expect 54 Mh/s from the 5700 XT and 50 Mh from the non-XT. I think the gold edition 5700 XT will still be 54 Mh/s. Power usage might be 20% lower than Vega.

&#x200B;

Now we get to price: the MSRP of the Navi cards are $380 and $450. But I expect AMD to start a price war with Nvidia's SUPER series, so these prices will drop soon. I'm guessing \~$340 and \~$400 respectively. AMD's profit margin on these Navi cards is pretty fat ([as speculated by multiple Youtubers](https://youtu.be/TN3HjuD3Xxs?t=643)). The new RTX Super series is like moving each existing RTX card up 1 tier in performance, while keeping price the same. That's pretty significant, so AMD will drop prices at least by 40-50.

&#x200B;

**I think the end result is $400 for Navi 5700 XT @ 54 Mh/s @ 160w, and $340 for Navi 5700 @ 50 Mh/s @ 140w**. Not much better than the existing $250 Vega 56 @ 42 Mh @ 130w. Not better than the $680 Radeon VII @ 98 Mh @ 250w. In fact, I'd recommend the Radeon VII because you can save on rig components (less PCIe slots) at a large enough scale.

I sold off most of my GPU during the end of 2018/2019 reinvesting that money into Crypto(Ethereum/BTC) when it was at it low points of ($100/$3800). I doubled my money with the recent bull run and now I recently acquired 104 RX 470 GB Nitro+ with a plan on acquiring 52 more for cheap(total of 156). I also purchased 38 P104-100s MSI/Colorful(24 pictured rest are enroute). In addition, I have 13 GTX 1660ti's, while my friend has 20(hosting it for him).  Total GPU account will be over 200+ GPUs. Thinking about Documenting my recent mining journey now with these RX470s 4Gbs/P104s. Mind you all I got them all cheaper than usually find. RX470 4GBs for $53 and the P104-100s for $180

&#x200B;

Plan for the RX470 4Gbs is 13 GPU Rigs on Windows 10 running Claymore 14.6 soft-modding the timings with as low as power as I can get. Preliminary testing shows each card can get about 30.9mh/s @ 110w\~(test with motherboard + CPU/GPU/RAM/SSD/PSU was 145w total from wall). Electric rate is .010c/Kw. The P104-100s with Claymore's new straps allows me to do 43mh/s @ 125w per card. Overall I'm positive about getting back in big time!

&#x200B;

Edit: For those interested. Per WTT as of today(June 12 2019)

30.9Mh/s per GPU x 156 RX470s = 4820Mh/s (110w per GPU) 17160w \*Estimated\*

43Mh/s per GPU x 38 P104-100s = 1634Mh/s (125w per GPU) 4750w \*Estimated\*

Ethereum combined hashrate = 6454 @ 21910w @.10c/kw \*Estimated\* = [50K Revenue yearly](https://whattomine.com/coins/151-eth-ethash?utf8=%E2%9C%93&hr=6454&p=21910&fee=1.0&cost=0.1&hcost=15000&commit=Calculate) 31K Income with current prices and difficulty. (YMMV)

&#x200B;

ROI time of approx 6 Months(just for the purchase the GPUs). Obviously, this can increase or decrease based on crypto markets price and difficulty.

&#x200B;

 Update: the OP with more rig pictures build in progress. Another 52 cards are enroute and P104-100s are racked! Currently testing 13x RX470s and 13x P104-100s.

Nervos generalizes Bitcoin’s UTXO model, creating a ‘cell model’ that supports smart contracts and Layer 2 protocols with a RISC-V virtual machine.

Check out the Nervos CKB in a Nutshell article!: [https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/nervos-ckb-in-a-nutshell-7a4ac8f99e0e](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/nervos-ckb-in-a-nutshell-7a4ac8f99e0e)

&#x200B;

**Nervos CKB Testnet Mining Competition -** [https://mineyourownbusiness.nervos.org/](https://mineyourownbusiness.nervos.org/)

To provide the community increased opportunities for involvement in the construction of Nervos CKB, the Nervos Foundation has officially decided to sponsor and host the Nervos CKB testnet mining competition. Anyone (outside of U.S. citizens unfortunately 😬) can participate in the event by mining testnet tokens and compete for a total prize of **1 million mainnet CKB tokens.**

**Reward One: Mining Whale Awards**Block rewards produced by each address will be ranked. Upon the completion of competition, the top three addresses that have mined the highest amount of block rewards will be rewarded as follows:

**First place:** 200,000 CKB Tokens**Second place:** 100,000 CKB Tokens**Third place:** 60,000 CKB Tokens

**Reward Two: Lottery**At the end of competition, 64 addresses will be randomly selected from addresses that have produced blocks (with the top three addresses excluded) and will be given 10,000 CKB tokens as rewards.

**Lottery Rules:**We will release the code base for lottery drawing ahead of time and use the block hash of the block at Nth block height as the seed for random number generation for selecting the lucky addresses.

We will announce a hash at the same time; the hash’s preimage will include information about N.

Participants will be able to use announced hash and lottery code to verify the outcome of the lottery.

**DatesStart Time:** Saturday, June 15, 2019 6:00:00 AM UTC, UNIX Timestamp: 1560578400At this time, participants can download the latest version of CKB client (v0.14.0) from GitHub releases [https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases), start a node, join the testnet and start mining.

**End Time:** Saturday, June 29, 2019 6:00:00 AM UTC, UNIX Timestamp: 1561788000Based on the UNIX timestamp of the block, the competition will end and the block reward rankings will be calculated.

**How to Participate**To start mining on CKB testnet, simply follow the steps outlined in the official guide [https://docs.nervos.org/](https://docs.nervos.org/) or community-created tutorials [https://talk.nervos.org/](https://talk.nervos.org/). A CKB blockchain browser [https://explorer.nervos.org/](https://explorer.nervos.org/) is available to check mining rewards.

Upon the completion of competition, we will calculate block rewards mined by each address. The **accumulated block reward of each address during the competition** will be the basis for determining the competition's winning miners and recipients of CKB mainnet token prizes (testnet tokens gained by transactions will NOT be counted as block rewards).

Rewards will be distributed directly to respective addresses on CKB mainnet. Hence, **please exercise caution when managing your private key** as it will be your sole means of claiming your CKB mainnet token rewards.

**Things to Note**

* This is the first round of competition in a series to come. It is possible that the future rounds will have different rules and rewards.
* CKB tokens rewards will have a lock-up period. The specific block height at which these reward tokens will be unlocked will be announced prior to mainnet release.
* Corresponding addresses for the same private key might differ on testnet and mainnet due to differences in algorithms. Participants only need to hold on to their private key to be able to claim rewards.
* By participating in this event, you acknowledging that you have read, understand and agree to the competition terms.

**Terms**Terms and Conditions:

* US citizens and US entities are excluded in this competition.
* The Nervos Foundation reserves the right to terminate the competition and change its related rules without further explanations.
* The Nervos Foundation reserves the right to refuse anyone participation in the competition based on reasonable suspicion.
* Participants will be responsible for any taxes associated with rewards distributed.

**Disclaimer:**

* There may be significant risks involved in cryptocurrency related activities. You may lose all your investment. Tokens involved might have high volatility. The Nervos foundation will not be liable for any potential loss, financial or otherwise.

Just a quick low-down the Reason ProgPoW was delayed because ""hardware partner who specialized in ASICs who was going to work with Least Authority to perform the hardware parts of the audit "" (Hudson Jameson)

&#x200B;

So effectively they cannot gauge how fast hardware ASIC could be built for ProgPoW Algorithm and if it really does support ""ASICs only being 2x efficient on it""

&#x200B;

I ask the community, does that matter to you? Are you concerned that ASICs ***could*** be built for Ethereum progpow?

&#x200B;

I personally think the Expenditure of such a thing when PoS is the end goal is stupid, literally, no company would spend millions of dollars on a single Algorithm.  ProgPoW helps Ethereum stay decentralized until PoS. Giving the rewards to the smaller, fractional, GPU miners.

&#x200B;

No it's not tin foil hat moment but I need your help!

&#x200B;

Help me debunk a myth that's stuck with some elderly people, like my folks that are very concerned about my mining rig emitting harmful electro-magnetic radiation, for my newborn child. The room of my newborn is right above the room of the mining rig, so it gets separated by a thick layer of reinforced concrete.

&#x200B;

From all the sources I gathered, I tried to explain to them that we all live in a EM world. For FFS light is EM radiation. Having said that it's also clear as daylight (pun intended) that some EM radiation is more harmful than others, like the cell phone tower radiation. While I'm no expert in the field and I judge from scrap memories I have from physics class, I remember that when current passes throw a conductive medium it gives away some EM radiation. Mostly so in case of a coil! 

&#x200B;

While GPUs have tiny coils in them, in both the PCB architecture and even the fans, I trust the radiation is minuscule and that it dissipates quite fast and at a short distance, let alone through 1/2 foot of concrete! 

&#x200B;

However I can't reason with them, and they got spooked by a moron's video from youtube calling the new 5G network the end of days for humanity (from all the radiation). While I have no knowledge about the new 5G standard, I have doubts it would be day and light more harmful than the 4G we use today for smartphones. Oh btw, caught they guy claiming SMART (phones, watches etc) doesn't come from ""smart"" as in brilliant but at in S.M.A.R.T, something about Super Military blah blah weapons. When I heard that I said ok enough with this BS and called it a day.

&#x200B;

I'm even inclined to purchase a EM meter from eBay to try and get some readings (if it's possible) and establish a baseline  next to the mining rig, and compare that against harmful EM radiation for humans.

Whattomine estimates I could make around $317 of profit per month at my current electricity cost. I'm looking to estimate the future profits and to have a guess at when the break even point is going to be. The whole setup will cost about $8,500, more or less.

I figured just multiplying $317 by 36 months is not good 😂 To be able estimate how much profitability I'll be losing per month in the next 3 years I looked at Whattomine's estimates for for a setup with 6 GTX 1080 which is now 3 years old and is estimated to make $164 per month.

To get from $317 to $164 over a period of 3 years I assumed a gradual decline with just over 1.8% per month (I can share an excel if anyone is interested). According to this calculation I'll break even in exactly 3 years – total profit of $8,600 that will just about cover the cost of the hardware 🙄

My question is: First of all, am I doing something completely wrong? What do you think of the way I calculate this and the assumptions I've made? Does this sound realistic from your experience? And finally, if the break even is in three years is it worth it – I mean you can still make some profit in years 4 and maybe 5, but will the hardware even last that long?

I realise that if there's another bull run and prices go up then the profitability will go up as well and change the picture substantially. I certainly hope so, but I intentionally left this out, because if I'm only counting on prices going up then I'm better off just buying the coins. I don't know if that makes sense.",1560121105.0

The PSU was also squealing as hell. If someone else has the same issue, I fixed it by playing in full screen with vertical sync enabled on a lower resolution. Do you guys think this is a PSU issue or a riser issue? I think the GPU is fine because he does not make any noises. (so no coil whine)  (Also I have only attached a GPU and one HDD to my PSU.)

&#x200B;

YES I KNOW A SATA RISER IS BAD, I am going to buy a new one soon. Can someone please explkain me as simple as possible why a sata riser is bad/dangerous? Also I'm thinking of buying a new molex riser, do you guys recommend molex riser? If so which one do you recommend for me?

(Update: it still crashed a lot, but now I've updated the bios and changed 3 settings: ERP, C1E and EIST and run the game in vsync full screen and it finally works.)

(Update 2: yesterday, I disabled Vsync in nvidea settings and it still worked, but today I booted my pc for the first time again. Sadly The crashes returned. Apparently changes to Nvidia settings only work after a reboot. So keep that vsync on. After changing it back and a reboot I could play again. Keep in mind that crashes still can occur. I did some 3d mark testing and most of the time it completed the tests instead of directly crashing. It crashed only one time more with vsync on.)",1559696550.0

444,Mining Rig Diagnosis,7,bwby2o,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/bwby2o/mining_rig_diagnosis/,32,"I've recently purchased a mining rig and managed to get it working correctly after a bit of tinkering. After this, I bought 2 Radeon Vega 56's which have subsequently made the system unusable.

I was able to achieve 28mH/s on Ethereum and 850H/s on Monero using the rx560s only. Everything was running fine until I attempted to add the Vega's.

I have used almost every miner under the sun and they all crash at various different points when the Vega's are inserted. Once the load LED's on the Vega's reach between 3/4 and full load the system freezes and needs to be restarted.When the rig freezes the fans on the Vega's max out, and sometimes they pump out a burst of air in the seconds leading up to a system freeze. Also there has been one single occasion where I got the rig stable for around 4 hours mining Ethereum at 110mH/s, however this was not able to be repeated.

I've ran GPU intensive games on the cards and they work fine under high load, so this is a mining specific error.

I'm unsure whether the cards I bought are innately faulty (I called tech support for the company I bought them from and they told me crashing under load could be a known problem with older Vega's) or I broke them by accident as I, stupidly,  flashed the bios to that of a vega 64 almost immediately. I have flashed the cards back to the original bios and they still do not work.

The rig is comprised of:

* Motherboard: ASrock H110 Pro BTC+
* CPU: Intel Celeron g3930
* GPUs: 2x Powercolour Radeon rx560 4Gb; 2x MSI Air Boost Vega 56 8Gb
* PSU: 80 Plus Gold rated 1650w
* RAM: 2x 4Gb Crucial DDR3
* SSD: 120Gb Kingston A400

Troubleshooting Steps Tried/Additional Information:

* Complete reinstall of windows: rx560s work correctly up until Vega's are added to the system. After Vega's have been added and then subsequently removed rx560s also crash the system.
* Multiple driver versions. Blockchain beta drivers, latest adrenalin drivers, and older adrenalin drivers do not yield different results.
* Different PCI risers. The rig came with 8 risers and none make a difference.
* Sequentially adding Vega's: Using absolutely any combination of the cards still leads to crashing. Running HDMI video out from either of the Vega's results in screen flickering and sometimes complete screen cut outs.
* Large pages are enabled, virtual memory is at 64Gb.

Any help at all is appreciated/any troubleshooting steps I should try. I have another 2 weeks to return the cards and get a refund/new cards. If additional information is needed to assist me let me know and I'll provide it.

Apologies if this is a bit rambly, TL;DR: original rig worked fine, adding Vega's causes freezing/crashing when they reach high load.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Mining Software Tried:

* Claymore Miner (3 most recent versions; worked for Ethereum initially, and had the 4 hour spell of Vega stability. No longer working).
* XMR-stak (Crashes after logging into pool)
* XMRig (Crashes almost immediately, didn't troubleshoot this one as well I was very annoyed after this failed)
* Multi Pool Miner (Worked correctly using rx560s, failed with Vegas, after Vega removal rx560s do not work)

Overclocking: None

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:

Thanks to everyone for their help! I still agree that a new PSU will solve the problem permanently but underclocking/undervolting the Vega's has allowed me to fix the issue for now.",1559604496.0

446,1 GPU Prevents whole System from booting and starting.,1,bvzib3,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/bvzib3/1_gpu_prevents_whole_system_from_booting_and/,21,"Okay.

Currently have a mining rig which has the following specs:

3x GEFORCE GTX 1070s
1x GEFORCE GTX 1080
ASUS Z270 SERIES MOBO
1700W PSU
And cpu etc.

Let me explain the problem.

One of the GTX 1070s prevents the whole rig from booting and prevents all the other cards from turning on and everything, and no beeps are made when turning on.
However, when I take out the 2x 8-Pin Connectors from that 1070, it all turns on correctly and boots.

So I thought it was a PSU Problem, but it’s not. I unplugged all the cards and only had the 1070 in and it still didn’t boot. Nothing.

I then swapped it to another riser cable. Nothing.

I put all the working cards in to the riser cable which that 1070 was originally using and it all works fine.

I swapped the 8-pin connectors from the good GPUs to the 1070 and vice versa. The cables aren’t the problem either. 

My rig was working before and all of a sudden they all just stopped working and I found out that this one card prevents the whole computer from booting. Random. Could it just be damaged? What else could I do? The PSU has more than enough power to supply it to all GPUs and even if I just use the weird 1070 on its own, or even with two, it doesn’t boot.

Can someone assist me in some way? I really don’t want to buy another 1070 or other GPU..

MSI Afterburner reads 95% power usage while GPU-Z reads about 56% or 155 watts. What could be the cause of this?

I have an Asus ROG STRIX 1080 Ti OC. If I run the pill, this happens, and my core immediately underclocks to <1200mhz and I lose hash. No matter what PL settings I set, it does not change. I have read the bitcointalk thread of the pill and I saw that I'm not the only with this issue. People with OC variants of Strix (regular ones don't - mine runs at 55mh/s) and the Asus Turbo also have this issue.

However, if I underclock the memory by more than 405 mhz (yes, that's -406 mhz underclock, any other underclock that's less than 406, the core will remain at <1200 mhz) the core clock jumps to 1303 to 1430 mhz and I increase hashrate to 47mh/s. Decent increase, but not good enough as 1080 Tis can manage 55mh/s+ with this setup.

Now, it's currently mining with these settings:

Core clock: 1303mhz - 1430 mhz

Memory clock: 4590 mhz (-406 mhz underclock, again if I decrease the underclock any further say -405, the core clock will decrease to 1000mhz, and I lose hash)

Hashrate: 47 mH/s

It's a CryptoNote coin that uses a Grin-like way of mining (Cuckaroo29s). The project aims to be the most fair, efficient and stable CryptoNote coin existing.

&#x200B;

This algo brings the Swap network superior protection and stability. Cuckaroo29s hashing improves verification speed substantially making block propagation much faster. It has also 15 seconds block time, no premine, no dev fees and no founders rewards.

We envision this project as a guide of what crypto “should” be. Unlike the vast majority of crypto projects, the core team associated with this project is mostly not anonymous. While none of us are actively promoting who we are, we aren’t exactly hiding it either. We are quite transparent and all decision making processes in the birth of this coin to now is readily viewable on our Discord server. We believe this is a testament to the fact that we simply want you to base your opinions not on who we are, but on the technology this project brings to the crypto ecosystem. We also put forth a call for any developers who would like to help build an ecosystem based on principles of fairness and openness to join us. This is a community project after all! Our ultimate goal is to create a stable blockchain that developers can build their products on top of without fear of some random agent bending the blockchain to their will, upsetting the desired stability necessary to take crypto to the next level of global acceptance and use.

The BIOs is modded for Ubermix. I've tried STRAP -1 and RXBOOST -1 didn't see any improvement at all. Wondering if anyone else has had success getting some extra hash out of there GPUs using this? Playing around with it I started see memory errors around 2050mhz\~ getting about 29.9mh/s it then crashed when I started lowering voltages.

&#x200B;

So from my understanding according to claymore:

>(Claymore Miner)  
>  
>\-strap   applies specified memory timings (strap).   Straps are sorted by intensity, i.e. ""-strap 1"" supports higher memory clock than ""-strap 2"", etc. For the best hashrate you must also set high memory clock, so ""-strap 1"" is a good start point for tests.   You can specify just strap index, for example ""-strap 1"" will apply first strap from database for all Polaris GPUs based on GPU memory size and memory type, miner will show full strap name detected.   Or you can specify strap directly in format ""POL8S1"": ""POL"" means Polaris, ""8"" means 8GB, ""S"" means Samsung memory, ""1"" means index.   Zero index means default strap from VBIOS, i.e. no strap is applied.   You can also use ""@"" character after strap to specify memory clock, it works like ""-mclock"" but overrides it, for example, ""-strap POL4E2@1900"". For Nvidia you can also specify delta, for example, ""-strap 2@+700"".   You can also specify values for every card, for example ""-strap 1@2100,POL4H3,0"".   If strap is applied, miner will return old strap and memory clock when miner is closed.   The best approach to find best strap is to set ""-strap 1,0"" (it sets strap #1 for first card and no straps for the rest of GPUs) and then raise memory clock to see what clocks and hashrate you can reach.   Then so the same for strap #2 etc.

&#x200B;

I should be using a different strap? maybe 2? Then overclocking memory higher?

&#x200B;

I also found this digging around the forums on AMDmem tweak

TRC = a limit for your memory clock, raising it will give you more stable higher memory clocks, lower it and you will get more performance (if you do not change your frequency) but memory could become unstable

I don't want to go through the trouble of selling them all, and they are still able to mine certain algorithms, so I'll probably end up keeping them, but I want to get feedback on what everyone thinks is the most efficient way to use them. 

&#x200B;

Right now I have them marbled throughout different rigs with other gpu's using Nicehash Miner Legacy. Should I have them all on the same rig mining a specific coin instead? What is recommended to mine if so?

&#x200B;

Is there any way to add gb's to the GPU's?

&#x200B;

If I was to sell them I'd want to get at least $200-$225 out of them. That's what they're being sold for on Amazon but I'm not trying to pay $40/month to sell them on there especially if it would take more than a month or 2 to sell them all.",1559012729.0

&#x200B;

I have been recently having problems with my miner. I am using Claymore v12.0 miner on my linux based machine and lately I have undervolted my cards. However, while mining normally, I have no problems but whenever the miner switches to devfee, it gets stuck, and GPU has failover error and can not start mining again unless I restart the machine. If it was due to undervolting, I am assuming the cards wouldn't even start mining. But something happens when it switches to devfee and I have to restart every 2-3 hours.

(*Just joking but seriously how funny that is!*)

&#x200B;

In all seriousness the market rebound is bound to bring new GPU players back to the game. Many of those who missed the 2017/2018 runs. I'm sensing many seeing this uptick may want to invest in building a small GPU farm. I've seen many miners fold and close up shop due to inexperience in the last run. I've seen crazy shit as one mid-size miner (500 GPUs or less) spending 10k for a massive watercooled vapor camber to keep his mining GPUs cool!

&#x200B;

So let's go over a few Terminology

*Investment*: Money spent on all hardware, software, buildings.

*ROI*: Return on investment. How long it takes for it to generate a return to what you initially invested

*Revenue*: Total income from all sources.

*Expenditures*: Total cost from all sources.

*CapEX*: Captial Expenditures (I.E purchase of all equipment)

*OPex*: operational Expenditures (I.E cost reoccurring items like electric)

&#x200B;

Now Cryptomining is probably the single WORST business to ever even think of trying to run! There many reasons for that but most importantly is that markets are not stable prices rise and fall dramatically, additionally 90% of early Crypto-coins have failed, BTC, LTC, DOGE, and XMR(which was rebranded) being the few longer standing coins.

&#x200B;

For this i'm just focusing on GPU minable coins. The focus will be Ethereum since it will continue to be GPU-minable for minimum of another year + including a new Algo changes.

&#x200B;

So you want to invest into crypto-mining (for whatever reason) where do you start?

&#x200B;

First of all is research, research, research!  After doing research come up with a plan!

I'm going to shill for u/voskcoin ([Channel here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a88b3bZwDi8)) and [BitsbeTripping](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVVWXoQfMfQVuzxcLylq9aA). These two have been my influence in how I got started mining. They are an excellent resource for GPU mining knowledge for starters.

&#x200B;

I'm keeping my focus on Ethereum because every GPU coin is different.

So start by learning about Ethereum, the inns and outs. How mining works in Ethereum and it's future plans. As  miners we all know Ethereum plans to go PoS. So while mining Ethereum for 3+ years is probably out of the question, it could still be part of a plan.

&#x200B;

So example of a plan could be: Start by mining Ethereum, Staking your mined Ethereum then shifting to another Eth-hash based coin that still PoW.

&#x200B;

*Investment*: How much are you willing to spend? It EXTREMELY important here to understand that mining operations **DO FAIL**. Your investment shouldn't leave you on the streets homeless and hungry. Just like trading only invest what you can **AFFORD TO LOSE**.

&#x200B;

Example: we'll have $10,000 to spend.

&#x200B;

Your first investment and most important is the hardware.

Your entire mining operation runs solely on **ONE PIECE OF HARDWARE**. Choose wisely! This one piece of hardware is the heart and soul of your operation. It's called the General Computing Unit or GPU, laymans terms Graphics Card.

&#x200B;

If you picking GPU mining the go-to standard was always AMD RX 400/500 series GPUs for Ethereum Mining. While right now this still may be true due to low prices it will change once Ethereum switches to another Algorithm. So you could be taking a gamble. While RX series perform decently it remain how much the new algorithm will affect hashrate/power in regards to current ETH rewards/price because it will change. Nvidia GPUs have been known for lower power and good hashrates, but they always come at a price premium.

&#x200B;

When picking GPUs I highly recommend buying all the same GPUs. Same brand, manufacture, type etc. This saves you countless headaches. While buying used may save you quite a bit money, these are longer term investments and fans plus other components can fail. You don't know how the previous owner took care of it. I always suggest buying new and off [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com).

&#x200B;

Now when it comes to motherboard, CPU, PSU etc. I have two schools of thought.

A) Buy 'Gaming' Motherboards, A good CPU (minimum of a 4-core High Ghz) 8GB RAM and a regular PSU

B) Buy a 'Mining' Motherboard, a cheap CPU(2-core low Ghz), 4GB RAM and Server PSUs

&#x200B;

It comes down to how much of a long term investment you plan to make and whether you're planning to resell the parts after say 1 year or 2 years. Option A) costs more in the beginning but gives you the choice to turn that mining machine into an actual computer for resale or individual parts on Ebay/Craigslist/Letgo. Option B) Is cheapest way to go for initial start-up and mining motherboards have nifty features such as PCI-E detection to help with trouble shooting. Server PSUs are cheap and handle high-wattage. However both these are next to impossible to off-load and low-power/2-core CPUs are hard to get rid of.

&#x200B;

Now the choice. How many GPUs in a rig? 6, 8, 10, 13, 18!? Personally I think for most beginners 6-8 is the max they should handle per rig. I made the mistake of doing 13 GPUs near the start and it cost me tons of down-time and lost revenue.

&#x200B;

Once you have the hardware part sourced, what about a frame? I  suggest building your own frames either out of wood or use an impromptu a metal rack from amazon. I do NOT suggest spending 50-100+ dollars on 'mining-rig' frames. These become literally useless and only other miners might be interested in them. Resale value of near 0.

&#x200B;

Well. Alright then! We're done right? We chosen our hardware, example 8-RX570, ASUS z370-A, G5400, 2 x 1000w PSUs and a metal wire rack from [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com). Now comes the question of location, power, and cooling!

&#x200B;

For location are you renting a commercial space? Putting in your bedroom/spare bedroom? Garage? (CapEX but also OPex if you're renting) The size of your operation determines the size of your space. If you plan on running it out of your house/spare bedroom Electric will be a major issue! [WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT USE EXTENSION CORDS](https://youtu.be/qGQ3lHKzsek?t=235)! These are trip and fire hazards. If you don't get the right gauge they will get hot and START FIRES. they are not meant for long-term use. I suggest using surge protector with the correct wattage rating. I do not suggest using Watt-meters and leaving them plugged in 24/7. Most watt-meters have a low wattage rating are not meant for long term use.

&#x200B;

Electrical wiring can and will be a major cost (CapEX) unless you know someone or do it yourself(I do not recommend!)

&#x200B;

For mining the best thing to do is to use 220/240v. the conversion is pretty painless and as long as these are marked you'll be safe. You gain additional amperage by switching allowing 3, 8 gpu rigs on a quad outlet at 20amps rather than 1 or max 2.

If you put something rated for 120v in 240v you WILL FRY IT. Computer PSUs are rated for both 120v and 240v these are safe to use on either. Server PSUs can do similar but you must check! Some are not dual-switching and can only be used on 120v or 240v!

&#x200B;

So now importantly and the major factor in CryptoMining... what is your electric rate? Since I live in the US it varies widely depending on location. If your in California you're basically SOL Electric runs as high as .30c/kw whereas other states such as mine, (Pennsylvania) Electric costs me about .09C/kw. Rates varying by season as well. It's very important to figure out your electric rate and how it may change if you using residential rates! (As Vosk found out the hard way). Commercial rates may be cheaper but come with other caveats such as you have to use so much Kw per month to get that rate etc etc. Again this goes into research!

&#x200B;

Ok, so we got Electric figured out, the location lets say spare bedroom (AND NOT THE BATHROOM VOSK), an Idea of rigs parts... and we're done? I really hope you'll didn't already pull that trigger on buying all the parts off amazon already!

&#x200B;

So we have $10,000 to invest for arguments sake(not necessarily checking prices) and we can build 4, 8-GPU RX570 rigs including extra expenditures like Electric upgrade costs and misc items.

&#x200B;

Now we head over on [WhatNOTTOMINE](https://whattomine.com/coins) and we look at ROI. It looks [pretty bleak](https://whattomine.com/coins/151-eth-ethash?utf8=%E2%9C%93&hr=708&p=2880&fee=1.0&cost=0.1&hcost=0.0&commit=Calculate) Estimating about 29.5mh/s per RX 570 with 117w\~ draw per card. the current ROI after .10c/kw electric is 3.3 years. Mind you this is estimated does not include actual down-time of rigs or difficulty adjusts either Higher/Lower in the future.

&#x200B;

Honestly if you're dedicated to mining, you really should not base your profits off WTT. This is because WTT calculates the daily price and give you an estimated earnings. As I said before the crypto market fluctuates far to much for this to be reliable source unless your cashing out the coins the day/second you earn them. The idea of mining is similar to trading. Mine when difficulty/price is low and sell when price is high. I'm of the mind that if your small enough, your day-time-job(don't quit it!) can cover the extra electric costs of your mining-op allowing you to keep as many coins as possible to speculate with! I made this mistake in 2017 not holding onto my coins when we're clearly in a bull-market at that time then holding on too long when it was a clear bear market.

&#x200B;

Be very clear in your plan with your farm. Expenditures and CapEX can go crazy if you decided to do things like buy 120mm fan for each rig, watercooling, or other exotic things. Keep everything simple and cheap. Your only profit making source from mining is the GPU (CPU can as well if you decide so). So keeping other CapEX and OPex expenditures as low as possible is the goal to a quicker ROI. 

&#x200B;

Finally I highly suggest some budgeting. Figure out the Electric Costs, Costs of rent(if any), and Costs of your Rigs. This is CapEX and OPex. 

&#x200B;

Revenue = Earned Crypto rewards -  OPex 

Expenditures = CapEX + OPex 

You do not 'profit' until your ROI is paid off! (You can count Revenue as Crypto-Holdings if your not actively selling it)

Profit = Expenditures + Revenue

Mind you CapEX and OPex can be used on your taxes as deductions. Depending on the size you call put it under ""Hobby"" or create a business in your name.

&#x200B;

Next create a Business Checking account (If your going fairly big!) or even a secondary checking account at your Bank/Credit Union. Business checking accounts require some tedium. I suggest Chase Small business checking as they only require a $1500 deposit  to avoid any fees. Key note here, DO NOT TELL THEM ITS FOR CRYPTO. They will shut you down imminently even though its just a business checking account. Banks hate Crypto. This will allow you track your OPex and use that $1500 to cover any further CapEX(Just make sure to refill it to $1500 either selling some crypto etc) This will greatly help in any taxes. Which brings me to major point

&#x200B;

Taxes. I'm going off American system. For taxes, as earlier said, you can depreciate your hardware YoY(year on year) as part of CapEX. OPex, like your electric, can be added up. If you using your own house your living out of that much harder to track. For Mining the IRS subscribes to the FIFO method (First-In-First-Out) Meaning the date you mined that coin is the price you start at. When you sell that coin(say 1-2 months later) the price is higher. Well now you have to subtract the price from the date you mined the coin from the price of the date you sold the coin. If it's a profit then you report it a 'gain'. Really stupid and confusing. Trust me. I cannot answer the question of Pools(whether you mined to a pool THEN get paid out say 1 ETH, is it the 1 ETH you got paid out or the the .0000123 ETH you mined?) There isn't clear guidance on that. Supposedly the IRS will be releasing new guide on crypto however I doubt it will affect mining taxes.

&#x200B;

Now that you have all that Information your ready to start your farm! And we haven't even begun mining yet, let alone GPU tuning, good mining OSes, how to cool your farm :D. That I might do later :)

&#x200B;

Hey all.

So I have been burned twice by two different sellers on this.  To be honest, I don't believe it's been intentionally malicious and the eBay sellers - Newegg (refurbished) and socalwarehouse (used) both are highly rated, but there appears to be a glut of Hynix HBM2 memory versions of the MSI AirBoost which are not just lower performing as expected compared to the Samsung, but flat out unusable both for gaming and for mining.

I happen to have a Samsung version which has been glorious since purchase over a year ago, so I was able to test each card in tandem as well as by itself separate from the Samsung and in/out of XF; let alone multiple clean driver reinstalls.

My first purchase was from Newegg about a month ago.  After experiencing the disaster of that card, I wrote it off as losing the refurb lottery.  It happens.  Newegg as usual was great about the process.

So imagine my surprise when I experienced nearly the exact same issues with my second Hynix card all over again.  Same tests run.  Same awfulness.  Even most of the sensors didn't even show in GPU-z.  And yes, I know GPU-z isn't exactly the best application, but again, never ANY issue with my Samsung card.

So yeah - just a warning.  Again, not just the lower performance we all expect from a Hynix model - so BUYER BEWARE!

Also I’m not mentioning mining OSes like HiveOS because this guide is targeted at non tech saavy miner and some popular apps like NiceHash are easier to setup on windows.*

If you build a small-scale mining farm with less than 20 GPUs, your earnings will probably be around 5-15$ per day. If you have a half decent job, your mining operation should be minimum maintenance because after a long day of work, you don’t want to have to fiddle with your mining farm just for a few extra $ per day.

The philosophy is to not waste time OVER OPTIMIZING because in the current market, making an extra 10%-20% is not worth the hassle for a small farm.

So do NOT waste time trying to find the best coins every day, most efficient undervolting/overclocking. That does mean not optimizing at all but find a reasonably good coin and overclock and stick to it for a while.

I’d recommend going Nvidia because their GPUs are easier to optimize. Stick with a single model (for ex 18x Asus Strixx 1080Ti) across all your mining rigs.

Disable all OS updates and driver updates. **Use your mining rig exclusively for mining and do not use your wallet on the same machine as not updating leaves your machine potentially vulnerable.**

Use a simple GUI tool like MSI afterburner to mildly overclock your cards (+200 mem, +100 core) and underclock (70% power target). These settings are stable and do reasonably well with most algos.

Go to whattomine.com and choose a major coin and stick to it or use a program like nicehash that will automatically mine the best algo and convert to BTC.

By following this, you will leave about 10%-20% of your earnings on the table, or about 1$-4$ per day. If you think your time is worth an extra few $ per day, be my guest and go mine your shitcoins and fiddle with memory timings.",1558441964.0

As the title says, the survey I put out yesterday ended up being an overwhelming YES. The survey hasn't been up for long, but the feedback was given quickly. It has already ended because we've already used up the number of responses allowed by SurveyMonkey while still on the free version. You can still respond, but we just won't see it.

Anyways, now that this is settled, there is one more step... creating the guidelines and rules for these postings. I want to open this up to the community for input. At a minimum, we should have these three rules:

1. Proof of Work algorithm (Hybrids are okay)
2. Blockchain must be active (Test net not allowed)
3. Block explorer must be active

While these requirements are very basic, we want to ensure that all coins being posted here are able to be mined and verified. We can get more strict on these rules if we'd like, but it would be foolish to remove any of these three without a proper replacement.

So, we'd like to hear your suggestions. In the comments below, make your suggestions, tweaks, edits, etc. to this plan. Be sure to make use of your upvote/downvote buttons as this will help us understand which suggestions are most important to the community.

506,Don't Make The Mistakes I Made,28,bohmx7,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/bohmx7/dont_make_the_mistakes_i_made/,17,"Now that it seems like another bull run has started, crypto mining will again be profitable for many (hopefully) and sadly some will make the mistakes others done in the past. The reason why I am writing this post is that I do not want anyone else to do the mistakes I have done with crypto mining. So, here are the things I suggest;

&#x200B;

**1) Always pay the electricity and other costs from your mining income.** 

This was the number one mistake I have made. I paid every month, around 400 USD electricity bill from my pocket and was mining 1.5K USD worth of coins per month. At the time I was saying ""lets pay the bill now, my coins will worth much more in the future"", but it didn't. I have hodled through the run, didn't sell anything for months, and when I sold it, my 1.5K worth coins at the time of mining was worth only 500 USD. And since I paid 400 USD before for electricity, my profit was just 100 USD. If I had just sold enough to cover the expenses, and kept the remaining, at the end, even if I were to sell at the lower price, I could get 300-350 USD, but it would be pure profit. All expenses covered money. And I could say ""even though price went down, I made 60-80% profit"". 

&#x200B;

So my suggestion is, always sell enough coins to cover your monthly expenses, such as utility bill and spare part costs. And hodl the remaining if you want to hodl. Never HODL the full amount and never cover the expenses from your pocket. You have already paid for the hardware, already paid something from your pocket, do not lose more money.

&#x200B;

**2) Don't use cheap parts, and use the hardware wisely**

I have seen some people using cheap cables or PSUs, and I myself have done that with my initial rig. Luckily, nothing bad happened to me but I had a lot of cables being burnt or PSUs going bad. Then I realized, instead of buying cheap things and later replacing them, if I just bought good hardware, and did not push the limits, my expenses would be less and the rigs would have costed me less. So, instead of overclocking, bios modding the GPUs over and over, and using cheap cables & psus for power management, get some good equipment and be okay with 1-2% less hash rate. Otherwise, if you brick a GPU, your losses will be greater than if you just didn't touch it. 

&#x200B;

Also buy a wattmeter, it really helps a lot, specially if you are running more than one rig. It allows you to see profitability and estimate the costs real time. And always keep your GPUs dust free. Once they have dust on them, specially if your rig is an outdoor one or has constant air flow with no filter, they tend to get hotter. And the hotter they get, the more power they use. So, keeping them clean reduces the heat as well as energy cost. Also sometimes it helps with the performance, and since you'll be running fans at slower speeds, they will last longer and you'll have less problems with fans.

&#x200B;

**3) Do not mention about your operation to many people**

Now, that's a mistake I have made and many others made too. Again, luckily nothing bad happened but I have seen people who had their rigs or GPUs stolen because of that. And I personally told almost all my relatives and my friends that I was GPU mining, so every time there was a price increase or decrease, they were calling me. Or every time they have some spare money, they were asking me where to invest. If you like to deal with such people, no problem. But if you want to live with peace, then it is better to keep the operation only to you and close people. When it was bull run, everyone was asking ""how much do you make???"" and it was awkward to answer. And when it was bear market, everyone was pointing their fingers and saying ""so you turned them off? what now? what happened to your money? you lost money?? I told you it was a bubble!!"" and this was really annoying.

&#x200B;

These were the three major mistakes I have done and now I wish I didn't. I hope others here will not make the same mistakes and hopefully we all can make some money from that bull run :)

507,How come Nicehash pays more than regular mining?,0,bohdow,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/bohdow/how_come_nicehash_pays_more_than_regular_mining/,22,"Greetings everyone,

&#x200B;

The title says it all but I just want to add couple more things. I know, during the times when there is a new coin launch or a fork, Nicehash tends to pay more than regular mining, specially for ETHash, (DaggerHashimoto). However, for the last month, Nicehash almost always pays more than regular ETH mining. Even after deducing their fees. They pay 4-10% more than regular mining.

&#x200B;

Now, when you make the calculations, if I were to mine 100 ETH normally, in a given timespan, I get paid 104 ETH by someone else via Nicehash. And since nicehash has their own fees, the person pays around 108-110 ETH for hashpower that could mine only 100 ETH in the given timespan. This would make sense if there was a more profitable coin and they were renting my hashpower to mine better stuff, but, there is none (on the long average). This made me got thinking whether there is a fork approaching or a new coin that uses ETHash and I don't know.

I know that system apart from GPUs us using 20w so I will just ignore that as it is insignificant.

&#x200B;

Now my real consumption I will be writing about is not taken one minute after miner starts, but it is 24 hours consumption of rig running for moths uninterrupted, fans under 20% (i know fans make more then 100W, more like 200w of the consumption).

&#x200B;

So here we go

39.75kWh/day per rig that means 138w per card. Now it is still relatively cold outside, so not much going to fans, again under 20% load.

&#x200B;

I get about 350Mh/s real hashrate with this settup on ethereum, and 12.5 kH/s on XMR. Consumption is about same both ETH and XMR. Again these are real hashrates over long period of time, not miner SW reported hashrates, etc.

I'm running cards on the classic 1150 at 880mV. I can't go to the 850mV that people write here about as rig is then unstable. Again stable for me means running for months without miner SW restarts.

&#x200B;

So is here someone who managed to lower power consumption on polaris and is willing to share real info and not something that works for one card and even then crashes after few hours or is using hwinfo power consumption?

I will add that rig i'm measuring on does have 3psus that are 80plus gold, so I guess maybe up to 200w is wasted on the psu efficiency if I only used 2 psus, but this is reality from the dual mining days and I guess lot of rigs are stuck with 1 more psu then needed.",1557694978.0

I found one review with a guy saying he can't prove it's a scam, but doesn't trust it. That's it for negative.

To play devils advocate, I mined with it, it did what it said it was going to do, and I'm sure this thing would get called out real quick if it didn't actually pay people, but I haven't reached the payment threshold. The 6.5% fee might make me question it less. ""We're micromanaging your entire rig, so pay us a huge percentage"". I think if it were  a scam, they would openly claim much lower.

evga 1060 3gb superclocked edition

3x gigabyte windforce oc 1060 3gb

win7 sp1

5 cards total with the 1070 plugged direct onto mboard and other 4 running off risers. Everything runs perfect in this format but heres the issue:

I use awesome miner to deactivate the 1070 when I get home and want to game. I game while 1060s are hashin away but I decided I dont need the 1070 for gaming when a 1060 will do me just fine so when I try to swap the 1070 for a 1060, everything still runs perfect with the exception that windows cant ""see"" the 1070 which is now on a riser. I switch it back and windows sees the 1070 fine as long as its plugged direct into mboard.

(the 1070 basically hashes as much as 2 of the 1060s so I'm anxious to make this work)

I've quadruple checked all risers and cards. All work as they should. Could it be a driver issue if the 1070 games and mines flawless as soon as its plugged back into mboard?

suggestions?

EDIT: evga 850 watt psu

MSI ab: usually on rvn so no overclock, just 80% power and 75% fan for cooling

EDIT 2: Solved! It was a riser but the 1060's ran perfect on same riser. 1st batch of risers was Volador brand, came in sketchy pkg and 1 was failed with brown gunk in power plugin right outta the box. I had another box unopened, brand is Bermunavy, was saving to eventually build out my Asus B250. The Bermunavy risers were pristinely packed with a card welcoming amazon comments and were gleaming shiny relative to the sketchy Voladors so I thought what the hell, gave one a try and bingo. So theres something I've neither seen or heard throughout a year of mining...a cheap riser may be able to run a 1060 but not a 1070.",1556440433.0

I understand that the AMD drivers check the bios and if it detects that there was a bios mod it won't let me use the card. However, why would this still be the case after restoring the original bios?

I would post the BSOD messages but they change so often that I'm not sure if they're even relevant. Also, a lot of the time it just hangs. Another thing it sometimes does, often when playing and mining at once (on different cards) I will hear my fans spin up and the screen will go black but I can still hear audio and my system responds when I click things but I can't see anything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Finally, I would like to ask about temps. I have a cooler master HAF 512 I believe and the two cards are very close together. The bottom card has much better temps because it's fan isn't blocked whereas the top card is blocked by the bottom card and gets very high temps when mining, 90 c, so I don't mine with the top one and just use it for games. I also have a fan right on them attached to the case door which sucks air out to help cool them down. Is there anything I can do to cool down the top card? Since I have these crashes I haven't really been mining at all, but once that is resolved I'd like to mine with both and not just the bottom one. I would consider liquid cooling but it seems that can cost several hundred dollars and I invested most of my money into the cards themselves. I would consider a bigger case but I think that the cards will always be the same distance to each other because of the motherboard, asrock x470 master SLI. I guess I could try doing something like a PCIe riser and figure out how to mount the second card elsewhere in my case so they have better air flow, but I don't really know where I'd put it.

>The idea behind bundling the two proposals together into the same update is to allay objections from Ethereum’s GPU miners about what amounts to a “tax’ on mining, by promising them ProgPoW, which improves GPU mining prospects.

As every day goes by more I see that Ethereum community and developers just really hate the Mining Community and Miners.

&#x200B;

Because this is the basis on ""funding problems"", I'd like to point out a short history to people who may not know this...

[Vitalik and friends raised funds in 2013](https://www.coindesk.com/information/who-created-ethereum) for the Ethereum project. This would start as minable PoW coin for fair distribution then switch in PoS few years down the line. The transition date was set for 2017 but as we saw that didn't happen, nor did 2018 or 2019 now.

>Raising more than $18m, it was then the most successful crowdsale to date at the time. It took another year, but the first live release, [Frontier](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-decentralized-app-network-launch/), launched on 30th July, 2015.

However, some short-sightedness means they forgot they would need continued cash flow for the project.

&#x200B;

So now the Developers in a panic due to low prices, low funds, and lack of asset/money management for the project. They are going to scalp the miners for there rewards. While other projects, aforementioned Zcash, do this it's was part of there written white paper(Ethereum's its not) and Zcash foundation which handles all funding but has also [grossly misspent it](https://cryptocoinspy.com/zcash-zec-founder-zooko-wilcox-in-300000-per-month-founders-reward-controversy/).

&#x200B;

there is not even a clear cut on how the funds will be handled by the EF. The idea is going back to DAO

>Owocki explained that the proposal is designed in two parts: the first part would add a block rewards address for a DAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, bounded by smart contracts and managed by Ethereum community members

And we all know what happened the last [Ethereum DAO](https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists)...

Something like this just irks me to no avail as I've been a GPU mining advocate and pushing ProgPoW.  Miners are always getting the short end of every stick for Ethereum. My problem is this, it's being touted as ""give and take"" Miners give up a part of the rewards and Ethereum implements ProgPoW. The problem is the ""Give"" part is something that should have been done already. If Ethereum Devs/Community, care about decentralization, PoW, and their network at all.  The ""Take"" part can be debated, while I'm not at all against the idea of Developer's taking miner rewards to fund, many projects do this, it couldn't be the worst timing for this to ""idea"" to come along.

The new mobo came yesterday, I got everything switched over, and it booted right up. I shut down, added the cards, booted, and downloaded the latest Geforce driver from Nvidia.com. I made it a point to look in Device Manager before I installed the driver, and I could see all four, including the new 2060.

I rebooted to finalize the install, but I booted to a black screen. Using a rescue USB I got into the command prompt and could boot into safe mode. I couldn't use any of the installed GPU's, but I could see them in Device Manager, so I figured it was a driver issue. Unfortunately reinstalling the drivers didn't seem to do anything, and I still got a black screen. 

I wound up reinstalling Windows, only to get the same issues. I reinstall, the cards show up in Device Manager, but installing the 419.67 driver sends me to a black screen on boot, with no signal from either onboard graphics nor any installed GPU. If I remove the 2060, then everything boots and works fine, so I'm leaning towards it being a bad card, but again, I could see it show up in the Device Manager, so I'm not sure about that either.

I already ruled out a power issue by adding the 2060 and a 1070ti to another PSU. I can see the 1070 TI in Device Manager, and it's lit up and the fans are spinning.

I'm really not sure what else I can try at this point, other than RMA the card and hope the next one works. Anyone have any ideas?

608,Does profitability increase significantly if you switch between coins all the time?,2,bb7r3m,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/bb7r3m/does_profitability_increase_significantly_if_you/,10,"I have been running three custom made rigs for almost two years now. All of this time they were set to mine ETH because I had no time to check profitability and mining cost. I have access to cheap electricity and I also believe that ETH is going to be huge in the next few years so I'm selling nothing. All I wanted was to accumulate as much ETH as I can and I think I could have made more.


I'm not an expert on mining and I rarely follow the news regarding this subject. Just recently I saw that a lot of projects are working on improving the UI and making things easier for people like me. My recent discovery was [Cudominer](https://www.cudominer.com/) and I think I need some advice from you guys.

Since it switches coins automatically based on profitability, will I be making more if I replace my Claymore with it or am I missing something? The payout can be set to ETH so my reasoning behind this is very simple. If the software will max out my profits on its own, I should be getting more ETH than I am mining right now.

The X16R hashing algorithm was introduced, by the Ravencoin project, in an effort to resist the development of dedicated ASICs, thereby increasing the decentralization of mining. For this reason, X16R was selected as the baseline for Veil’s mining.

Threatening decentralization, Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) code for X16R is known to exist, and expected to become widely available soon. To address this risk, Veil has created an implementation of the algorithm, called X16RT, which preserves almost all the benefits of X16R, but with an added barrier against FPGAs. In particular, the ordering of blocks in X16RT have to follow different rules to be accepted by Veil nodes.

While mining pools, and even exchanges, will not have to make modifications on the software side, software that calculates block hashes and submits them to the network will.

611,Crypto Mining Farm Update at Apartment - 04/08/19,13,bavgsm,gpumining,https://youtu.be/Ls1nflGddgI,13,,1554767645.0
612,Thinking of starting a small Mining farm? Rather just Buy Crypto. why not both?,0,batq0v,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/batq0v/thinking_of_starting_a_small_mining_farm_rather/,14,"I've been hearing the argument around here about **""Why mine, buy crypto?""** They're right on some fronts. Buying and HODL for years is a far easier task than mining, that we all know here for sure. yet some of us are tech enthusiasts and just love playing with the hardware or dipping our feet into making a small company.

&#x200B;

However, I purpose a different plan Why not *BOTH!* crypto has matured quite a bit that we have now more options for lending/loans. If you have some savings, 5-10K say. Take that, invested in BTC. Then with that BTC take a small loan out to buy the hardware.

Few DeFi's come to mind

[https://celsius.network/](https://celsius.network/)

[https://nexo.io/#](https://nexo.io/#)

[https://blockfi.com/](https://blockfi.com/)

( I would stay away from SALT considering it was an ICO in 2017)

&#x200B;

Nexo offers 16% APR loans but has other advantages, Celsius and BlockFi have low APR rates but typically require more BTC for the loan.

&#x200B;

So while you can invest 10K or so in BTC, then take a loan out for 4-5K @ various interest rates, buy the mining hardware/equipment. Which then earns you more crypto to put towards loan(I.E expand it further or getting more equipment) or to pay back the loan. Meanwhile, your BTC investment can continue to grow.

&#x200B;

Also, a reminder most banks will not give you a loan for ""Cryptomining"" or anything to do with ""crypto-business"" because they see it as high-risk. I wasn't even able to a business checking account at a bank because I mentioned bitcoin.

Having an issue with the ASUS B250 MINING EXPERT as follows:

If I add a third GPU to the system it will not BIOS POST. (No beeps at all)

Running latest 1007 BIOS update (02/28/19)

Pulled battery and shorted CMOS reset

Have a paddleboard in PCI-E 16x slot (read this was an potential issue)

Tried populating in both low and high number sockets. (first 16x +A1 andA2; then 16x + C16 and C17; also just C16-C18 (no 16x))

CPU - 1600W supply; MB noted; G3900 Skylake; 16G DRAM ; 250G SSD; only NVIDIA GTX1550's - only intending to use 6.

No GPU's installed - DRAM tests (MEMTEST86) passed for 73 hrs. All standard SW installs painless.

No overclocking etc.

Not intending to mine. Just want to work on some mining, AI and CUDA coding so please refrain from criticizing performance etc - not wanting to make a competitive rig - just a nice development bed utilizing the parts from this market segment.

\--

Debug details:

If I have two GPU's in the system everything is fine - boots, Win7 drivers load - perfect.

Rotate riser paddleboards through all positions with two GPU's - works for all positions. (Not a PCI issue)

Rotate in different pairs of GPUs and repeat above - works fine (not a GPU issue)

So not a GPU issue; not a paddle/cable, riser or power issue. (All slots work)

Seems to be just a ""third"" GPU issue.

MOBO Speaker connected - not even a POST beep - dead if a third GPU is added.

\--

Slowed PCI-E to GEN 1 from 2 - no change

4G Memory mode enabled (makes the two GPU mode work so left it)

Turned off UEFI modes in BIOS - no change

Since it will not POST - Mining vs Standard boot mode makes no difference

&#x200B;

ASUS is willing to RMA the board but given ALL slots function independently it just feels like a BIOS setting issue to me. Given many are posting successful rigs in excess of two GPU's I thought it prudent to ask the community before I RMA'd.

Thanks to all.",1554280707.0

My project is that I have an itx board with a single x16 pcie slot. It also has 3 m.2 pcie gen3 x4 slots. I have one free m.2 slot and wanted to convert that to x16 via riser. I wanted a 2nd low power silent gpu added to the rig.  I went with the fanless msi 1030. It has a max draw of ~30w so I figured sata power would be safe. I purchased [this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-3-0-NGFF-M-2-To-PCI-E-16X-Graphics-Card-Extender-Cable-Riser-Adapters/173102256398) and [this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Graphics-Card-Extension-Cable-Adapter-PCI-E-M-2-M2-to-x16-for-PC-Bitcoin-Mining/282884115526) to test with. Neither work!! So it must be something on my end??  
The first part is fairly standard, the difference being I'm going to a m.2 slot where most of you are coming from x1 or x4. ""In theory"" this should just work! I'll start with the 2nd part since it's very simple: m.2 connector -> x16 socket + sata power. I hooked this up, seated the gpu and booted up. Nothing. Not even bios. I pulled the gpu and booted. Bios worked and booted up (running a 1080ti direct on the board). Installed the gpu back and nothing. I bought the 1030 used so I pulled the 1080ti and installed the 1030 direct to the mb. Works! So then I thought maybe the riser is bad or that sata power is insufficient seeing that most gpus would also have 6+8pin direct whereas mine has no external power. So I swapped risers out. This time the 008s with additional power connectors. Exact same thing. First I powered via pci only. Then sata+pci. And finally sata+pci+molex. In all situations the red led lit up. In all situations if I **do not** have the gpu plugged in it boots up fine. The strange thing is I never get into bios. No speaker or post lcd on this board so my troubleshooting is limited. And to note I test both gpu hdmi ports just to make sure one vs the other was set to primary. I got lazy and just looked at my mouse to light up to see if it booted. The mouse stayed dark, implying it never posted. Any help would be greatly appreciated!  
**solved** I have two m.2. ports which are pcie only. I have 1 port that is pcie/sata. the suggestion by u/sqrtlurface was to use the pcie/sata port and now the 1030 is being recognized in both linux and windows.",1554187854.0

&#x200B;

For the first year, Minerstat was very buggy even tho they were charging premium price for it. I was the ultimate beta tester, was reporting every issues on a weekly basis and Coinscrow was very effective at fixing them quickly which was very nice.

&#x200B;

Everytime this software update, which is on average every 2 months, you'll have to uninstall it and reinstall it on at least half of your rigs. And if the update happens in the night or anytime you are not watching, enjoy having at least half of your miners idle for a few hours/days.

&#x200B;

The devs nowadays don't give a single shit about you, they won't test anything. YOU are the tester. 

&#x200B;

With the market being so low, we barely break even, well with minerstat not working half the time, enjoy having 0 profit.

&#x200B;

Profit switching always and I mean ALWAYS switch to a worthless shitcoin that will make you mine at a loss. Never ever use it.

&#x200B;

The mobile app is totally useless, you can't do anything on it, mobile version of the website is 10 times better.

&#x200B;

I've paid over 5000$ to minerstat at this time in subscription fee. I've been out of town 1 week. I came back and nothing was mining, absolutely nothing. And best of all, they had deleted all my settings and my whole profile because I was late 3 days in payment. Even tho they are a small business and I was one of their biggest and I've been with them since the beginning of it all. Thats not all, I paid the 400$ monthly fee as soon as I got home and less than an hour after I saw everything was gone. NO REFUND. 

&#x200B;

I've been too lazy to redo all the settings on another software for months but thanks for this, I can finally move on from the shitshow that is minerstat

&#x200B;

If you were ever thinking about moving your mining operation to minerstat. Consider SMOS / HiveOS / AwesomeMiner / Nicehash.

I'm unsure if the actual physical size of the tent matters.

On one side, if a tent has less volume, the fan will be able to exhaust the hot air more frequently then in a bigger tent.

But a bigger tent holds more air and the heat has more volume to expand to, thus lowering the overall temperature.

# What is Genesis?

[Genesis (GENX)](https://genesisnetwork.io) was created in 2018. Genesis is founded by five cryptocurrency enthusiasts who have been involved in a multitude of different cryptocurrency projects throughout the years. The goal of Genesis is to develop a payment processing ecosystem that’s fast, efficient and most importantly, business and consumer friendly.

The ecosystem is considered the Genesis Network and will be focused on user-ease. Let’s be honest, for the normal consumer, cryptocurrency and blockchain is difficult. The team at Genesis aims for simplicity.

The Genesis Network has a public team led with over ten years in business and management experience and over fifteen years in back and front-end development.

**Specifications:**

Ticker: GENX

Algorithm: Equihash 192\_7

RPC Port: 7423

P2P Port: 7233

Pers. String: GENX\_PoW

Diff Algorithm: Zawy 12’s LWMA

Block Size: 2MB

Block Time: 60 Seconds

Block Reward: Random until block 325k then 350 GENX per block (miner)

Max Supply: 4.12 bln

**Features**:

* First Equihash based cryptocurrency on BTC codebase 0.16.x
* Maturity-based masternodes system utilizing the latest [Dash DIP003 Protocols](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0003.md)
* No Premine/ICO/Auction

# Mining Genesis

Genesis decided to utilize the tried and true [Equihash algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equihash), but decided to stray off the beaten path of ASICs and Zhash and go with the 192\_7 variant. The reason behind this decision was that very few cryptocurrencies (only ZER at the time of GENX launch) utilized the Equihash 192\_7 variant rather than the 144\_5 variant. Genesis wishes to stay GPU-friendly and ASIC-resistant as long as possible. Therefore, an algorithm that’s not highly targeted seems to give the longest potential of staying off the ASIC radar. As of this post, 192\_7 is NiceHash resistant as well.

**Why can’t I find a calculator?**

Genesis also utilizes randomized block rewards between 20-1000 coins per block. As of masternode activation at block 325,000, this randomized reward will go away to a strict 350 coins per block (for miners).

**Superblocks**

Daily, weekly, monthly and annually, GENX has superblocks. These superblocks are intended to keep miners engaged on Genesis for the chance of bringing home a nice stack.

**Superblocks Intervals**

\[block interval\] \* 10

Daily: 1440 \* 10 = 14,400 $GENX Bonus

Weekly: 10080 \* 10 = 100,800 $GENX Bonus

Monthly: 40320 \* 10 = 403,200 $GENX Bonus

Yearly: 483840 \* 10 = 4,838,400 $GENX Bonus

# Final Thoughts

Genesis is a bit different than your typical shitcoin. We’re doing much more than developing a blockchain, but rather an ecosystem. Genesis should not be looked at by the coin alone, but rather the base of the Genesis Network.

I am a fan on Hiveos right now. Recently I altered the hashrate watchdog script to work with the USB watchdog so that way we do hard resets instead of using a command.  


Please check out my video if you like subscribe.  
This is the video guide I made:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfCnabAjHn0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfCnabAjHn0)  


First thing is to plug in your USB watchdog correctly.  


Turn on the Miner and SSH into it.  


Edit the file /hive/bin/wd  


Replace: nohup bash -c 'sreboot'   
with: /hive/opt/qinheng/hl340 reset  
different watchdogs will use a different script  


Then restart the service with this command: systemctl restart hive-watchdog.service  


And done.  


You can test by setting the hashrate watchdog to an unrealistic expectation and then wait and watch the USB watchdog work.  


If you have any feedback let me know thanks! and I hope this was helpful to the few of you out there

Its open for anyone to use so I wanted to go ahead and share it in its beta state.  

[**https://www.rigradar.com/**](https://www.rigradar.com/)

To test it out, you do need to make sure you have port forwarding on your mining rig set up.  For security, you also need to know what port you are using (It works really well if you set up all your miners to the same port).  From there, all you need to do is go to the site and plug in your IP:PORT and you are good to go.  No information is stored on servers, it is purely a read/output for your rig information.  All address information is stored on your local machine and can be deleted with a button at any time. Below is an example output. 

[https://imgur.com/41KjbrU](https://imgur.com/41KjbrU)

Some features it displays are (results vary depending on miner):

* Current total hash rate
* Max/avg/min since you have been watching
* Heartbeat graph 
* Share information 
* Pool link
* Individual GPU information

Additionally, there is a built in table mapping for pool information.  If I have a pool's API stored, other metrics will be displayed: 

* Current luck
* Estimate coins/day
* Difficulty 
* NetHash

671,Vertcoin Mining AMA,46,b2a9h0,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/b2a9h0/vertcoin_mining_ama/,34,"# What is Vertcoin?

Vertcoin was created in 2014. It is a direct hedge against long term mining consensus centralization on the Bitcoin mining network. Vertcoin achieves its mining consensus solely through Graphics Cards as they are the most abundant / widely available consensus devices that produce a reasonable amount of hashrate. This is done using a mining algorithm that deliberately geared against devices like ASICs, FPGAs and CPUs (due to botnets) making them extremely inefficient. Consensus distribution over time is the most important aspect of a blockchain and should not be taken lightly. It is critical that you understand what blockchain specifications mean/do to fully understand Vertcoin.

# Mining Vertcoin

When users of our network send each other Vertcoin, their transactions are secured by a process called mining. Miners will compose a so-called block out of the pending transactions, and need to perform a large number of computations called *hashes* in order to produce the [**Proof-of-Work**](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work). With this Proof-of-Work, the block is accepted by the network and the transactions in it become confirmed.

Mining is essentially a race. Whoever finds a valid Proof-of-Work and gets the block propagated over more than half of the Vertcoin network first, wins this race and is allowed to reward themselves with the *block reward*. The block reward is how new Vertcoin come in circulation. This block reward started at 50 VTC when Vertcoin was launched, and halves every four years. The current block reward is 25 VTC.

# Why Does Vertcoin Use GPUs Then?

ASIC’s (Manufactuer Monopoly)

If mining were just a spade sure, use the most powerful equipment which would be an ASIC. The problem is ASICs are not widely available, and just happen to be controlled by a monopoly in China.

So, you want the most widely available tool that produces a fair amount of hashrate, which currently manifests itself as a Graphics Card.

CPUs would be great too but unfortunately there are viruses that take over hundreds of thousands of computers called Botnets (they’re almost as bad as ASICs).

# Mining In Pools

Because mining is a race, it’s difficult for an individual miner to acquire enough computational power to win this race solo. Therefore there’s a concept called pool-mining. With pool-mining, miners cooperate in finding the correct Proof-of-Work for the block, and share the block reward based on the work contributed. The amount of work contributed is measured in so-called *shares*. Finding the Proof-of-Work for a share is much easier than finding it for a block, and when the cooperating miners find the Proof-of-Work for the block, they distribute the reward based on the number of shares each miner found. Vertcoin always recommends using P2Pool to keep mining as decentralized as possible.

How Do I Get Started?

If you want to get started mining, check out the [**Mine Vertcoin**](https://vertcoin.org/mine) page.

# Vertcoin just forked to Lyra2REv3 and we are currently working on Verthash

Verthash is and was under development before we decided to hard fork to Lyra2REv3. While Verthash would’ve resulted in the same effect for ASICs (making them useless for mining Vertcoin), the timeline was incompatible with the desire to get rid of ASICs quickly. Verthash is still under development and tries to address the outsourcability problem.

Verthash is an I/O bound algorithm that uses the blockchain data as input to the hashing algorithm. It therefore requires miners to have all the blockchain data available to them, which is currently about 4 GB of data. By making this mining data mandatory, it will become harder for auto profit switching miners — like the ones that rent out their GPU to Nicehash — because they will need to keep a full node running while mining other algorithms for the moment Verthash becomes more profitable — the data needs to be available immediately since updating it can take a while.

Over the past month, we have successfully developed a first implementation of Verthash in the Vertcoin Core code base. Within the development team we have run a few nodes on Testnet to test the functionality — and everything seems to work properly. The next step is to build out the GPU miners for AMD and Nvidia. This is a NOETA at the moment, since we’re waiting on GPU developers which are in high demand. Once the miners are ready, we’ll be releasing the Vertcoin 0.15 beta that hardforks the testnet together with the miners for the community to have a testrun. Given the structural difference between Lyra2RE and Verthash, we’ll have to run the testnet for a longer period than we did with the Lyra2REv3 hard fork. We’ll have to make sure the system is reliable before hardforking our mainnet. So the timeline will be longer than with the Lyra2REv3 hard fork.

Some people in the community have voiced concerns about the fact that Verthash development is not being done “out in the open”, i.e.: the code commits are not visible on Github. The main two reasons for us to keep our cards to our chest at this stage are: (1) only when the entire system including miners has been coded up can we be sure the system works, we don’t want to release preliminary stuff that doesn’t work or isn’t secure. Also (2) we don’t want to give hardware manufacturers or mining outsourcing platforms a head start on trying to defeat the mechanisms we’ve put in place.

second try was wo change the GPU with a GPU in other place in the rig. The Problem still is in that position (so not the card is the problem). ok - switched the pcie cable from PSU with another position. dont work...

Checked different zip codes and addresses couldn't find the plan for under $160, went as high as $262 a month.

Mining even at that price point isn't worth the cost so i sold everything and bought crypto.

5 months ago I rocked the HOUSE buying a $4500 rig with 2 2080 and 2 2080 ti that I preordered on the first day they were available.  At that time I summarized what the losers were saying in other threads:

&#x200B;

You'll never ROI!

* At that point I wrote: Most businesses never turn a profit. I'll ROI eventually. WINNING!
* Now: According to Nicehash (don't hate) each 2080 ti should make 47.56 a month after electricity (10c/KWh, not what I pay, but nicehash default, so I'm going with it), and each 2080 should make 23.50 a month after electricity. 142.12/4,500 cost x 5 months=16% paid off!  This is an underestimate, since GRIN/BEAM profits are lower now.  I'm actually up around 23% paid off. WINNING!

You'll only make like $1 per day!

* At that point I wrote: For now. After things are optimized for them, and power issues are solved, I'll be making $5 per day! WINNING!
* Now: According to Nicehash (with all of the same assumptions), I should make $3.02 per day. Closer to $5 than $1, and actually, I really make around $4 a day now, and a lot more before.  WINNING!

You'll only make like $5 per day!

* At that point I wrote: Sounds good to me! WINNING!
* Now: WINNING, Duh!

If you bought 8 1080 ti for $4,000, and put them in your $500 rig, you'd be making $5 per day today!

* (truncate: I basically argued it's better to have 2x2080/2x2080ti than to have an equally priced at that time 8x1080 ti rig.)
* According to Nicehash each 1080 ti should make 11.68 a month after electricity. 8x11.68=$93.44 /4,500 cost x 5 months = 10% paid off. This is an underestimate, but it's an easy apples to apples comparison with the 16% paid off number in point 1.

&#x200B;

In the comments, someone said "" I bet you are kicking yourself now that you have seen the initial hashrates. ""

\> No, I'm winning myself! Grin/Beam were awesome and are still winning!

Someone else said that 2080 and 2080 ti would have dropped in price.

\> No drop, because StrongCryptographer: Winner! Trolls: Losers! Buh bye!

One winner wrote ""You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like. ""

That's because I have tiger blood.

(sung by Christina Aguilera) StrongCryptographer, winner!

&#x200B;

In conclusion, let's look at the score board:

StrongCryptographer: 10,000

Trolls: 0

Tough day for the trolls.  Purchase is in the past, I'm done. I'd like to thank my sponsors Tiger Blood and Baby Urine.

Amperage usage from PDUs multiplied by electricity cost gives me how much I spend per day.

Pool stats multiplied by current coin price gives me how much I earn per day.

Subtract both and I got my profit for the past 24h.

Then do this super fancy formula:

I purchased a few Alpha miners second hand off of craiglist and used them for a few months before it was no longer profitable in my area. I am trying to use a few of the RX 570's as regular GPU's but I haven't had any luck yet.

When I look the 2 GPUs in device manager the chip set, drivers etc is unknown. I have uninstalled the drivers on the PC with DDU several times. I have no idea what the manufacture is and when I reached out to Alpha miner they sent me some photos that lead me to believe they are RX 580 8GB Diamonds, but the PCB says RX 570 4GB and the rest of the serial and part numbers get me nothing on my searches. When I look at them in AMDVBFlashWin they come up as ""D00033 Polaris20 XL A1 GDDR5 256Mx32 300e/300m"" and MSI after burner saw them as 8GB RX580's until I attempted to reflash them and the computer froze, it did this with both GPUs. I used a BIOs from a similar spec'd ""Powercolor"" GPU with reference clocks, they are now seen as RX570's in MSI AB and I can't get them to be flashed in the AMD reflash tool, I get ""SybsystemIDs mismatch"" then a freeze if I let it sit. When I attempt to open Radeon settings I get ""No AMD graphics driver is installed or the driver isn't functioning"" The ram on the GPUs is Elpida. 

I have video output with basic window drivers and even when I install the 570's drivers I get a video output that can give me 1080p, but still nothing that registers anywhere. My next attempt is to try and load up drivers for a RX 580 and see what that gets me. 

Curious if I can use these GPUs or if anyone has any experience or a better direction to point me in.

So I am looking to improve the noise and heat mining within my studio apartment, also to find the best way to add and ventilate more GPU rigs (I am going back home over break and taking some back down from the GPU farm I have up there).

Ideally any structure I made could be dissembled and useful elsewhere when I no longer live here and adaptable to a new living situation if I ever moved to another place in the future I wanted to mine out of. Also inexpensive is preferred. Looking for ideas, I am thinking of an fairly sealed insulated box encapsulating the setup with removable panels and one of the windows as the air intake.

Initially I was going to have a large cabinet pushed into the corner of the room and just a massive in-line turbine with flexible ducting too and from the intake and exhaust. But it seems like that would cost more, keep in mind I only live here for another five months so I wouldn't want anything too expensive. Having the exhausts guided directly out of the windows seemed the most straightforward way, but annoying having the whole set of three windows blocked too. Not very neat, would be nice to perhaps only use a portion of the window's opening.

&#x200B;

Thanks for any input. So far have been mining succesfully for two months with this setup. Lyra2zRev3 on the Vega 56 gpus and X11 Nicehash for the asics, net \~0.1 BTC/month from this.

I should say this build is for Rendering, not mining.
And it also serves as my Work/gaming PC. So I don't want to cripple the performance if possible.

The problem is Windows 10 isn't detecting any Video card plugged into my PCIE x16 slots via the PCIE risers. The 1x slot is not a problem though, it works fine. Though I only have one on my board.


I've tried a few things to get it to work.
1) Tried different videocards in different risers, they all work, on the 1x slot. No combination works in the 16x slots.
2) In the BIOS I enabled 4G Decoding and changed all the PCIE link speeds to Gen1. But nothing changed

At stock settings the 1660 Ti mines at the same levels as 1070, but at around 118 Watts.

&#x200B;

Mining on different Algos, adjusting the Core and Memory settings didn't do anything to increase hashrate but adjusting the TDP reduces the power draw to 90 Watts. Measured from the wall, Average temps varied between ALGOs from 63C to 67C. When Mining Equihash 144\_5 it seemed better to leave to core clock and memory clock alone and just reduce TDP to 75%. GMiner performs better for me then EWBF miner. As driver & DEVs release newer revisions of their miners, we should see more stability - better performance when mining with the GTX 1660 Ti.

&#x200B;

Pushing The Memory OC while mining ETH past +1100 seems to reduce the hashrate. So 1100 is the sweet spot for my card, anything beyond that will crash. Trying +1400 on memory, cause Nvidia inspector to crash and be unusable so I had to reinstall drivers. \*\*\*Note: just because you can push the memory really high like the 20 series card, don't push it too hard.

&#x200B;

**Ethereum**

I noticed there's a bug in the miners or software. Because something up. Topping out +1500 memory does nothing. Basically anything pass 6800mhz Memory results in decreased results. Best I was able to get was 29.5Mh/s @ 65w\~ however claymore's miner was the only one working properly and had crazy hashrate bounces. Needs Miner Dev to ""tune"" or add GTX1660ti kernels into there miners.

Edit: getting about 30mh/s\~ in phoenixminer 4.1c stably @60w\~.

&#x200B;

**RVN**

RVN was probably the best result out of all of them. I'm talking 16mh/s\~ for a mere 75w! That's GTX1070ti levels performance for almost half the wattage. Extremely impressive.

**GRIN**

Only 3.3\~h/s for GRIN. Assuming optimization needs to go here as well for Miner Dev's

**Zhash**

Another bad result.  Only 36sol/s\~ at stock that is GTX1060 levels. Again I assume as time goes on GTX1660ti will get some more love and show its true power.

&#x200B;

My take: the GTX1660ti was ""[Ampere](https://hothardware.com/news/ampere-and-turing-nvidias-future-geforce-gaming-and-cryptocurrency-mining-gpus)"" the unreleased Mining GPU from Nvidia they teased last year. It lacks RT/Tensor cores which lowers power consumption yet brings all of turnings excellent feature set. Truly the GTX1660ti will be the next ""RX480"" for mining if you will.

ZEN had a great run of GPU mining that lasted well over a year, and brought lots of value to the early Zclassic miners. It is mined using Equihash protocol, and there have been ASIC miners available for the algorithm since about June of 2018. GPU mining is not really profitable for Horizen at this point in time. 

We’ve got a lot of miners in the Horizen community, and many GPU miners also buy ASIC miners. Happy to talk about algorithm changes, security, and any other aspect of mining in the questions below. There are also links to the Horizen website, blog post, etc. below.

So, if I’m not here to ask you to mine, hold, and love ZEN, what can I offer? Notes on some of the lessons I’ve learned about maximizing mining profitability. An update on Horizen - there is life after moving on from GPU mining. As well as answering your questions during the next 7 days.

# Mining for Profitability - Horizen (formerly ZenCash) Thanks Early GPU Miners

### Author: Rolf Versluis - co-founder of Horizen

In GPU mining, just like in many of the activities involved with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, there is both a cycle and a progression.  The Bitcoin price cycle is fairly steady, and by creating a personal handbook of actions to take during the cycle, GPU miners can maximize their profitability.

Maximizing profitability isn't the only aspect of GPU mining that is important, of course, but it is helpful to be able to invest in new hardware, and be able to have enough time to spend on building and maintaining the GPU miners. If it was a constant process that also involved losing money, then it wouldn't be as much fun.

## Technology Progression

For a given mining algorithm, there is definitely a technology progression. We can look back on the technology that was used to mine Bitcoin and see how it first started off as Central Processing Unit (CPU) mining, then it moved to Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) mining, then Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and then Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). 

Throughout this evolution we have witnessed a variety of unsavory business practices that unfortunately still happen on occasion, like ASIC Miner manufacturers taking pre-orders 6 months in advance, GPU manufacturers creating commercial cards for large farms that are difficult for retail customers to secure and ASIC Miner manufacturers mining on gear for months before making it available for sale. 

When a new crypto-currency is created, in many cases a new mining algorithm is created also. This is important, because if an existing algorithm was used, the coin would be open to a 51% attack from day one, and may not even be able to build a valid blockchain.

Because there's such a focus on profitable software, developers for GPU mining applications are usually able to write a mining application fairly rapidly, then iterate it to the limit of current GPU technology. If it looks like a promising new cryptocurrency,  FPGA stream developers and ASIC Hardware Developers start working on their designs at the same time.

The people who create the hashing algorithms run by the miners are usually not very familiar with the design capabilities of Hardware manufacturers. Building application-specific semiconductors is an industry that's almost 60 years old now, and FPGA’s have been around for almost 35 years. This is an industry that has very experienced engineers using advanced design and modeling tools. 

Promising cryptocurrencies are usually ones that are deploying new technology, or going after a big market, and who have at least a team of talented software developers. In the best case, the project has a full-stack business team involving development, project management, systems administration, marketing, sales, and leadership. This is the type of project that attracts early investment from the market, which will drive the price of the coin up significantly in the first year.

For any cryptocurrency that's a worthwhile investment of time, money, and electricity for the hashing, there will be a ASIC miners developed for it. Instead of fighting this technology progression, GPU miners may be better off recognizing it as inevitable, and taking advantage of the cryptocurrency cycle to maximize GPU mining profitability instead.

## Cryptocurrency Price Cycle

For quality crypto projects, in addition to the one-way technology progression of CPU -> GPU -> FPGA -> ASIC, there is an upward price progression. More importantly, there is a cryptocurrency price cycle that oscillates around an overall upgrade price progression. Plotted against time, a cycle with an upward progressions looks like a sine wave with an ever increasing average value, which is what we see so far with the Bitcoin price.

&#x200B;

[Cryptocurrency price cycle and progression for miners](https://preview.redd.it/s9405f4lc8j21.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acb3d6295615ab53551333acbe4cb5b8bcf92b73)

This means mining promising new cryptocurrencies with GPU miners, holding them as the price rises, and being ready to sell a significant portion in the first year. Just about every cryptocurrency is going to have a sharp price rise at some point, whether through institutional investor interest or by being the target of a pump-and-dump operation. It’s especially likely in the first year, while the supply is low and there is not much trading volume or liquidity on exchanges.

Miners need to operate in the world of government money, as well as cryptocurrency. The people who run mining businesses at some point have to start selling their mining proceeds to pay the bills, and to buy new equipment as the existing equipment becomes obsolete. Working to maximize profitability means more than just mining new cryptocurrencies, it also means learning when to sell and how to manage money.

## Managing Cash for Miners

The worst thing that can happen to a business is to run out of cash. When that happens, the business usually shuts down and goes into bankruptcy. Sometimes an investor comes in and picks up the pieces, but at the point the former owners become employees.

There are two sides to managing cash - one is earning it, the other is spending it, and the cryptocurrency price cycle can tell the GPU miner when it is the best time to do certain things. A market top and bottom is easy to recognize in hindsight, and harder to see when in the middle of it. Even if a miner is able to recognize the tops and bottoms, it is difficult to act when there is so much hype and positivity at the top of the cycle, and so much gloom and doom at the bottom. 

A decent rule of thumb for the last few cycles appears to be that at the top and bottom of the cycle BTC is 10x as expensive compared to USD as the last cycle. Newer crypto projects tend to have bigger price swings than Bitcoin, and during the rising of the pricing cycle there is the possibility that an altcoin will have a rise to 100x its starting price. 

Taking profits from selling altcoins during the rise is important, but so is maintaining a reserve. In order to catch a 100x move, it may be worth the risk to put some of the altcoin on an exchange and set a very high limit order. For the larger cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin it is important to set trailing sell stops on the way up, and to not buy back in for at least a month if a sell stop gets triggered. Being able to read price charts, see support and resistance areas for price, and knowing how to set sell orders are an important part of mining profitability.

## Actions to Take During the Cycle

As the cycle starts to rise from the bottom, this is a good time to buy mining hardware - it will be inexpensive. Also to mine and buy altcoins, which are usually the first to see a price rise, and will have larger price increases than Bitcoin.

On the rise of the cycle, this is a good time to see which altcoins are doing well from a project fundamentals standpoint, and which ones look like they are undergoing accumulation from investors. 

Halfway through the rise of the cycle is the time to start selling altcoins for the larger project cryptos like Bitcoin. Miners will miss some of the profit at the top of the cycle, but will not run out of cash by doing this. This is also the time to stop buying mining hardware. Don’t worry, you’ll be able to pick up that same hardware used for a fraction of the price at the next bottom.

As the price nears the top of the cycle, sell enough Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to meet the following projected costs:

* Mining electricity costs for the next 12 months
* Planned investment into new miners for the next cycle
* Additional funds needed for things like supporting a family or buying a Lambo
* Taxes on all the capital gains from the sale of cryptocurrencies

It may be worth selling 70-90% of crypto holdings, maintaining a reserve in case there is second upward move caused by government bankruptcies. But selling a large part of the crypto is helpful to maintaining profitability and having enough cash reserves to make it through the bottom part of the next cycle.

As the cycle has peaked and starts to decline, this is a good time to start investing in mining facilities and other infrastructure, brush up on trading skills, count your winnings, and take some vacation. 

At the bottom of the cycle, it is time to start buying both used and new mining equipment. The bottom can be hard to recognize.

If you can continue to mine all the way through bottom part of the cryptocurrency pricing cycle, paying with the funds sold near the top, you will have a profitable and enjoyable cryptocurrency mining business. Any cryptocurrency you are able to hold onto will benefit from the price progression in the next higher cycle phase.

## An Update on Horizen - formerly ZenCash

The team at Horizen recognizes the important part that GPU miners played in the early success of Zclassic and ZenCash, and there is always a welcoming attitude to any of ZEN miners, past and present. About 1 year after ZenCash launched, ASIC miners became available for the Equihash algorithm. Looking at a chart of mining difficulty over time shows when it was time for GPU miners to move to mining other cryptocurrencies.

&#x200B;

[Horizen Historical Block Difficulty Graph](https://preview.redd.it/0ujrxt6yk8j21.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11df521a142a70e80dec381bbd237cc80893617e)

Looking at the hashrate chart, it is straightforward to see that ASIC miners were deployed starting June 2018. It appears that there was a jump in mining hashrate in October of 2017. This may have been larger GPU farms switching over to mine Horizen, FPGA’s on the network, or early version of Equihash ASIC miners that were kept private. 

The team understands the importance of the cryptocurrency price cycle as it affects the funds from the Horizen treasury and the investments that can be made. 20% of each block mined is sent to the Horizen non-profit foundation for use to improve the project. Just like miners have to manage money, the team has to decide whether to spend funds when the price is high or convert it to another form in preparation for the bottom part of the cycle.

During the rise and upper part of the last price cycle Horizen was working hard to maximize the value of the project through many different ways, including spending on research and development, project management, marketing, business development with exchanges and merchants, and working to create adoption in all the countries of the world.

During the lower half of the cycle Horizen has reduced the team to the essentials, and worked to build a base of users, relationships with investors, exchanges, and merchants, and continue to develop the higher priority software projects. Lower priority software development, going to trade shows, and paying for business partnerships like exchanges and applications have all been completely stopped.

Miners are still a very important part of the Horizen ecosystem, earning 60% of the block reward. 20% goes to node operators, with 20% to the foundation. In the summer of 2018 the consensus algorithm was modified slightly to make it much more difficult for any group of miners to perform a 51% attack on Horizen. This has so far proven effective.

The team is strong, we provide monthly updates on a YouTube live stream on the first Wednesday of each month where all questions asked during the stream are addressed, and our marketing team works to develop awareness of Horizen worldwide. New wallet software was released recently, and it is the foundation application for people to use and manage their ZEN going forward.

Horizen is a Proof of Work cryptocurrency, and there is no plan to change that by the current development team. If there is a security or centralization concern, there may be change to the algorithm, but that appears unlikely at this time, as the hidden chain mining penalty looks like it is effective in stopping 51% attacks.

During 2019 and 2020 the Horizen team plans to release many new software updates:

* Sidechains modification to main software
* Sidechain Software Development Kit
* Governance and Treasury application running on a sidechain
* Node tracking and payments running on a sidechain
* Conversion from blockchain to a Proof of Work BlockDAG using Equihash mining algorithm

After these updates are working well, the team will work to transition Horizen over to a governance model where major decisions and the allocation of treasury funds are done through a form of democratic voting. At this point all the software developed by Horizen is expected to be open source.

When the governance is transitioned, the project should be as decentralized as possible. The goal of decentralization is to enable resilience and preventing the capture of the project by regulators, government, criminal organizations, large corporations, or a small group of individuals.

Everyone involved with Horizen can be proud of what we have accomplished together so far. Miners who were there for the early mining and growth of the project played a large part in securing the network, evangelizing to new community members, and helping to create liquidity on new exchanges. Miners are still a very important part of the project and community. Together we can look forward to achieving many new goals in the future.

Right now I'm torn between the two, and I'm honestly not sure which is the better card. I know the RT cores don't do anything for mining, but the RTX has a ~400 more cores. It also has slightly faster memory at a higher bandwith. However, its clock isn't as fast. 

Anyone have any thoughts?

X21S

&#x200B;

This hashing algorithm was created specifically for Ritocoin, and was designed to resist FPGAs, ASICs, and NiceHash. It is X16S (16 algorithms shuffled and hashed),, followed by 5 additional hashing algorithms: haval256, tiger, lyra2, gost512, and sha256. The inclusion of lyra2 brings numerous advantages, making parallelization of the algorithm practically impossible, with each step relying on the previous step having already been computed. It is a “friendly” algorithm that makes GPUs produce much less heat and uses less electricity during mining.

&#x200B;

Take your time to learn more about us in the below story of Ritocoin...

&#x200B;

The spirit of Bitcoin continues to inspire, empower and enable people around the globe. Ten years later, just as it seemed Bitcoin was being defined by commercial agents and regulated governance, that same free and independent spirit imbued the Ravencoin community. In ten short months, however, 30% of the Ravencoin project’s net hash comes from NiceHash and the looming impact of the imminent FPGA mining cards and X16R bitstreams certainly promises to shake up the dream of this GPU miner’s darling.

&#x200B;

Ravencoin’s fair launch genuinely inspired our developers and supporters. We admire the way Ravencoin came out swinging — fighting for fairness, an honest distribution of coins and a place where GPU miners could thrive. The asset layer attracted many more miners and investors to the pools. Many Ritocoin enthusiasts came from the Ravencoin community, and continue their association with that project.

&#x200B;

The whole crypto ecosystem should appreciate the work begun by Ravencoin. Obviously they continue to inspire and motivate us to this day. It’s the reason we took action. We decided to start our own project which focuses upon at least two pillars of decentralized networks in the crypto space: community governance and a fair distribution of coins. It is a core belief throughout Ritocoin that in order to successfully develop and maintain this hacker’s playground — a place where a broad range of ideas could be tried and allowed to flourish — these two ideals must be allowed to drive and guide our community.

&#x200B;

This deep focus on community choices creates a project flexible enough to support most ideas, and agile enough to define new frontiers.

&#x200B;

A mining network’s distributed ledger is defined by its technology. Like many in the broader crypto-mining community, we value the GPU for its accessibility. These processors are available for purchase all around the world without any legal restrictions. GPUs are vastly more accessible for hobbyists and miners to acquire. They can be shipped nearly anywhere around the globe, a nice benefit to the popular secondary market which has sprung up much to the chagrin of PC gamers.

&#x200B;

More constraints exist for the ASIC and FPGA miner. Laws in some parts of the world restrict people from using or buying ASIC and FPGA mining hardware. This alone is directly in confrontation with Ritocoin’s core values of decentralized stewardship and sovereignty.

&#x200B;

The GPU, in essence, is like your voice. Anyone with the means of acquiring one GPU should be able to have their voice heard. ASIC and FPGA mining devalues the GPU miner’s voice and silos that coin’s network away from the small scale and personal mining operator. A truly community driven project means each stakeholder, regardless of size of contribution to the network’s net hash, has an opportunity to build, vote and direct.

&#x200B;

If you are already familiar with our website, discord or whitepaper, you are probably aware that masternodes had been proposed as a feature of the network from the beginning. This opened the door to ongoing discussions in the Ritocoin community regarding

&#x200B;

● A masternode’s true purpose

&#x200B;

● What benefit they provide to the project

&#x200B;

● How the benefit is realized

&#x200B;

● The collateral

&#x200B;

This discussion, governed entirely by stakeholders across the extended network yielded a defining moment for our vision of flexibility. We have not yet found the potential utility of masternodes, however, the conversation has not reached an extent to where we could abandon the idea. To quote one of our developers during this discussion on our Discord:

&#x200B;

>*“Just want to give a reminder here that even though masternodes are on the roadmap, it is not set in stone. This coin belongs to the community and we will do what we as a community want to do. If we conclude that we want to take this coin a different direction than masternodes, then that is what we’ll do.” --traysi*

&#x200B;

We are all volunteers at Ritocoin. Our moderators and community leaders try to give immediate support to all users that require it. Contact us in Discord or Telegram, not only for support, but, proposing new ideas, revising old ones and just so you can find a place to get together and find people to hang out with. You are well within your rights to enjoy yourself at any given moment, and, should you feel so inclined to begin working with the team, we just so happen to be looking for ambitious individuals that see themselves as being part of a greater vision, are inspired by change, and inspired to be the change they want to see making things better in this world.

&#x200B;

Join us in a space where your ideas to build something great can become a reality. We are eager to know what you think is best for the future of Rito. What steps would you take to become more resilient, stronger, fair and decentralized? Because at the end of the day, like it or not, love it or leave it.. this is your coin, too.

&#x200B;

You can become a significant part of this project. We will help you further develop the role you wish to fill in the cryptocurrency space — influencer, developer, analyst, you name it. This is not a just-for-developer’s playground. We want the enthusiasts. We want the perplexed and the rabbit-hole divers. This is the coin for everyone who is trying to find their place on the path that Satoshi began unfolding in 2008 after the collapse of the housing market rippled out into the subsequent crash of global markets. That’s why we have Bitcoin, remember? Be your own bank. This is why Satoshi and [Bitcoin.org](https://Bitcoin.org) kept their software open source. It’s up to us to keep the torch ablaze.

&#x200B;

**Community funds**

&#x200B;

For the first year, about 1% of mined coins are set aside into a developers fund that is used to provide bounties to the community developers who make substantial development contributions to the Ritocoin ecosystem. We have already paid out numerous bounties for important work that has already benefits Ritocoin in substantial ways. We also have another donation-driven community fund that has recently been put together for the purposes of doing fun contests and things like that.

&#x200B;

**Cooperation and collaborations**

&#x200B;

We have discovered a number of fatal flaws in the original Ravencoin codebase and worked with the Ravencoin developers to get those fixed in both Ritocoin and Ravencoin. This work has benefitted Ravencoin in numerous ways and we look forward to a long time of collaboration and cooperation between us and them. Many members of the Safecoin team are also in our discord group, and have collaborated with us in shaping the future decisions of Ritocoin. We have several thousand members in our group and they represent all walks of cryptocurrency life.  We invite all coin developers, miners and enthusiasts to join our discord and be a part of this coin that truly belongs entirely to the community.

&#x200B;

**Block reward**

&#x200B;

A couple weeks ago we met for a scheduled meeting in our discord group and had a lengthy conversation about the block reward. Our block reward started at 5,000 RITO per block (every 60 seconds) just like Ravencoin. This extremely high number of coins coupled with the high profitability of mining led to unforeseen consequences with pools auto-exchanging the coin into bitcoin. This dumping by non-community miners had a very negative impact on the community sentiment and morale, as we watched the exchange price plunge. We looked at other coins and realized that this fate has befell many other coins with high block rewards. Following much discussion, we decided to change the reward structure. Starting around March 19th the [block rewards will start to slowly go down](https://ritocoin.org/docs/rewards.php) in a curve until it reaches 1,000. Then the reduction will be even more slowed down with block rewards exponentially dropping at periodic intervals. We have posted charts on our website that shows what the long-term effects of our reward reducing algorithms will be. As a miner, the next 2 months will be a great time to mine and hold, while the block reward is still fairly high. We encourage all miners and cryptocurrency enthusiasts to take advantage of the current favourable block reward and build a nice holding for yourself. Then join the community and be a part of the fun we’re having with this project.

`This post was prepared by a collaboration of multiple Ritocoin members and was posted to reddit by the core developer Trevali, who posts to reddit under the ritocoin username and will be very happy to answer any questions anybody may have about our project. Traysi (well known in the Ravencoin community) is also an active Ritocoin developer and may come to this thread if needed.`

&#x200B;

In some of the previous posts, moderators of this subreddit told us that we (minerstat) are allowed to post monthly-ish updates on our development. Since we think that this new feature is something that most of the GPU miners can benefit from, we decided to share it with you here.

&#x200B;

Our new benchmark tool is fully presented on this Medium blog post: [https://medium.com/@minerstat/minerstat-mining-tutorial-31-benchmark-7b2545a713d7](https://medium.com/@minerstat/minerstat-mining-tutorial-31-benchmark-7b2545a713d7)

&#x200B;

Key takeouts about our benchmark tool:

* Benchmark is free for everyone.
* Benchmark can be executed on Linux mining OS or Windows mining software.
* Benchmark is fair as it can be conducted to your own wallets and pools (advanced benchmarking) or to universal testing stratum pool that mines ""empty"" and nobody earns from it (simple benchmarking).
* Benchmark can be exported and saved directly to mining calculator.
* Hashrates and electricity consumptions can be loaded directly to profit switch.
* Benchmark results are available on a public profile.

&#x200B;

Example of public benchmark profile for 1 x GTX1080: [https://minerstat.com/benchmark/t5dmftvqnr](https://minerstat.com/benchmark/t5dmftvqnr)

&#x200B;

For simple benchmarking, we are using our own free sandbox stratum pool. It is called a [pool.ms](https://pool.ms) and you can read more about it here: [https://medium.com/@minerstat/pool-ms-universal-sandbox-pool-for-miners-and-mining-client-developers-6e920214aaab](https://medium.com/@minerstat/pool-ms-universal-sandbox-pool-for-miners-and-mining-client-developers-6e920214aaab) This pool is open to the public and the goal of it is to benefit mining client developers, miners that like to test different mining clients, and anyone who would like to benchmark something quickly.

&#x200B;

We would love to hear any feedback or see the results you got on your mining setups for different algorithms and clients. Please note that the feature was just released so if you face any errors or troubles, we appreciate the screenshot of the error and more details about your hardware, algorithm, and mining client that failed.

It was born to achieve freedom of speech and question-and-answer worldwide. It's decentralized and ASIC-resistant, this is achieved by a new POW consensus algorithm.

&#x200B;

As we all know, bitcoin is mined by calculating sha256, so whoever calculates sha256 fast will be able to produce new blocks before anyone else, this is exactly what ASIC mining machines on the market are good at.

&#x200B;

In order to weaken the advantages of ASIC mining machine, the mining algorithm of askcoin uses sha256 combined with memory loading to resist ASIC machine. In askcoin, the speed of mining depends mainly on the speed of memory load, not the speed of sha256 calculation.

Now, Askcoin's Mainnet is launched, it is different from any question-and-answer project in the past, because it is a completely decentralized project, which is reflected in the following aspects:

2. Anyone can freely choose whether to mine on the Full node or not.

&#x200B;

3. Anyone can run their own block explorer freely.

&#x200B;

4. Anyone can connect askcoin's block explorer to the full node they are running

&#x200B;

5. Anyone can connect askcoin's mobile app to the full node they are running

&#x200B;

Unlike Bitcoin, askcoin uses an account model, so before using askcoin, you have to register an account in the block chain. In askcoin, there are five types of transactions:

&#x200B;

Register an account

Transfer

Ask a question (or topic)

Reply to a question

Reward a reply

&#x200B;

In order to prevent DDoS attacks, 2 ASK fees will be deducted from the initiator of each transaction. But if you are registering an account, who will pay for it? That's what your referrer should do.

&#x200B;

In askcoin, if you want to register an account, you need to enter your username, avatar, and the string signed by your referrer. When the full node receives your registration request, it will deduct 2 ASK from your referrer's account.

&#x200B;

Of the 2 ASK fees paid for each transaction you initiate since then, 1 ASK will be paid to the miner's account that put the transaction in the block, and another 1 ASK will be paid to your referrer's account.

&#x200B;

The total supply of askcoin is 1000 billion, of which 500 billion is produced by miners through mining, and another 500 billion is temporarily retained by the founder team for promotion, popularization, attracting users, stabilizing the market and so on. When the project develops to a stable state, we are willing to donate most of our ASK coins and transfer them to the system reserve account to supplement the supply of mining (the proportion of donations will reach or exceed 80%). That is to say, the vast majority of ASK comes from mining.

&#x200B;

SPECIFICATION:

Total supply: 1000 billion (considering the long-term support of small reward amount, so a single ASK price must be low enough)

Block time: 20 sec

Block reward: 5000 ASK

Algorithm: SHA256-AR (asic-resistant)

For the reasons stated above, when you first register, you need someone to generate a signature string for your registration. You can post a reply here, leave the user name you want to register, or tell me through telegram that I can help you generate this signature string. The person who replies here can get 1000 ASK coins for free. Once you register successfully, you can also help others to generate the registration signature string by using the corresponding function button in the mobile app, and you will automatically become their referrer.

&#x200B;

To make it easier for new users to register, we have released a web tool to generate signature strings for users to register. You can access its source code through github:

[https://github.com/lichuan/askcoin-gen-reg-sign](https://github.com/lichuan/askcoin-gen-reg-sign)

&#x200B;

If you are a new user and need to register, you can generate the signature string for registration through the following address:

[http://generate.askcoin.me](http://generate.askcoin.me)

&#x200B;

If you want to register through mobile app, you can copy the signature string generated by the above tool to the corresponding input box in the registration UI of mobile app for subsequent registration process.

&#x200B;

If you want to register by running the full-node command, you need to modify the config.json file first, and make sure that your node has established a communication connection with other nodes, and then wait for your node to synchronize with other peer nodes before proceeding with the registration process, and then synchronize your system time with global UTC time (using crontab and ntpdate command).

I have not had any issue receiving payout from either pool. I started with f2pool and will be staying there as a result of these tests.

Testing conditions, same rig, same miner (latest Bminer), same OC settings, I mined till I reached payout on f2pool which took my rig roughly a week due to only having 2 Titan Xp's, at any point during that week I could look at my ""last 24hrs earnings"" and I was between 0.44 Grin and 0.47 Grin, I switched to Grinmint (which takes 24 hours to confirm in the coin you earn, so you can use the ""immature balance"" to determine what you made in the last 24 hours) I ran for 26-27 hours, the highest it got to was a little over 0.37 Grin, I switch BACK to f2pool and i'm right on the edge of the 24 hour mark and i'm at 0.459736 Grin.

In a perfect test setup you would run identical rigs each on a different pool then swap to see if one rig is just running slightly better, but the far and away 20+% earnings difference makes it quite clear to me that all of that dudes excuses (like difficulty is increasing every day) is complete BULLSHIT, Grinmint is a GARBAGE POOL that pays WAY WAY WAY less then other pools. (you can check my post history if you want to see the other excuses this dude came up with).


Additional things found during this test, f2pool over estimates your hashrate, Grinmint under estimates your hashrate, most online Grin earnings calculators SUCK.


Edit: If you've got multiple matching rigs, would love to hear your longer term numbers, i've outlined a testing scenario that I think everyone can agree with in a reply below, basically 1 solid week on each pool, then switch the rigs to the other pool and do another week.",1549520707.0

Seriously, I doubt NH would have added support for MimbleWimble at all if not for the runaway success of Grin. I mean, how many other algos have been released but NiceHash ignore. 

Secondly, the frustration is real that the profitability of Grin as about to be shit on cause NH wanted there piece of the pie. I’m sure I’m not the only one out there who has taking the time to learn and research how to run batch files to directly mine a coin. 

This is where the irony comes in, I was a religious user of NH for over a year because I said “It was easy.” I never really realized how much of a plague they were to crypto. They encourage a substantial centralization of power. Not only that, they sell that substantial power out to the highest bidder like a relentless, merciless mercenary. NH is responsible for how many 51% attacks that we know of? 

I branched out to download the miners, set the bats up, found credible pools only to have my time wasted by NH building the “easy switch” so they can profit.

Honestly, I’ve come to realize that not only have  ASICs killed the hobbyist miner but NH as well as they will nose there way into anything that they can make their 5% on. Seriously next to impossible without creating a coin that didn’t support pool mining in general but it would be a game changer to release a coin that was immune to NH like some are to ASICs.

Off topic of this post, but it’s amazing the complacency people have with NH freezing their payback due to the “market downturn”. Like really? They are still one of the most active mining services in crypto taking their few percent cut but they are too poor to finish paying out the money that was stolen (most likely by an inside man).

Long story short for all GPU miners out there, Ethereum Devs have called a, *VOTE WITH HASHPOWER,* to take place at some point in the future. This VOTE will be through pool operators(such as Ethermine/Nanopool) who will (I assume) create a special pool/port where you vote will be go to be counted. All in Favor of ProgPoW will simply mine to that pool. All opposed will Abstain from it.

&#x200B;

Additionally The Dev's have decided to ""Audit"" ProgPoW to gather more information.

Based on three factors, the Audit, Information, and the Vote they will make a final decision to implement ProgPoW.

&#x200B;

Edit: After talking to some Dev's on Gitter, it seems the voting will work like this. A vote for ProgPoW(Mining to a pool that support ProgPoW), A vote against(Mining to a pool that does not support ProgPoW), or Abstaining/ Don't care either way.",1549167105.0

817,2 of my RX580s Cause ''Bad Pool Caller'' BSOD,2,alt4kt,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/alt4kt/2_of_my_rx580s_cause_bad_pool_caller_bsod/,5,"Hey everyone,

In one of my rigs today, I faced with something very different today. I came home from work and got an interesting e-mail from ethermine stating that one of my rigs is offline. As usual, I restarted the rig, started overclock.exe and started Phoenix Miner 4.1c. I should say this miner is about a year old.

It worked for around 4-5 mins with no problem and then I smelled a burnt cable (I assume) and instantly turned off my rig. As I tried to reboot, I saw Bad Pool Caller BSOD for the first time in my life, after a quick googling, I thought the RAM was broken. I changed the RAM's slot, and restarted my rig, the same. Then, I turned my BIOS settings to default and thus disconnected 7 of the cards (It wouldn't detect anyhow since I disabled 4G decoding) and I was able to boot with no problem. In any case, I DDU'd and reinstalled the very same driver with clean install (Beta Blockchain Driver). Then I restarted, no problem again. Then I followed the guidelines from [mining.help](https://mining.help/) to set my BIOS, then connected all the GPUs and it started. The rig didn't detect 2 of my aforementioned RX580s (the fans didn't stop rotating) and this is where I thought there's a driver issue. Then when all of my 8GPUs connected, I DDU'd and tried to install Beta Blockchain Driver again and till a point all was well, then ''Bad Pool Caller'' BSOD popped up again. Interestingly, I disconnected 2 RX580s, the rig boots with no problem. When I connect the very same RX580s to the rig when the rig is on, the fans start rotating, as it's trying to install drivers for the first time. I waited around 5 mins, they didn't show up in device manager. But the good news is the GPUs are powered (Their blue sapphire lightning is glowing shine and when I connect them to motherboard the fans rotate). I thought the risers are gone since I smelled a burnt cable/plastic, but if that was the case, I believe the fans wouldn't rotate at all or they wouldn't cause problems in booting or installing the driver (in all tries I did clean install).

I should say, these 2 GPUs share their power cables as well as their risers connected to the same SATA cable. So it's 1 SATA cable 2 risers and 1 GPU power cable 2 GPUs.

I spent around 3 and a half hours after work today and have some other ideas to try following days. However, I'd like to ask the community for their suggestions to overcome this shitty fuss.  I left the rig on mining with 6 cards to see if any other errors will occur. I don't have a wattmeter at home but the output is 191.4 MH/s with 6 RX580s for Ethereum.

&#x200B;

My other ideas:

\- Since I believe I caused a driver problem somehow, after DDUing I will install another version of AMD drivers. I kinda feel like I saw 8 unidentified graphics card in device manager after the first try of DDU, but not quite sure. If after DDUing, I can boot my rig with 8 cards connected; I will be sure that installing a different driver and switching to my preference should overcome it. We'll see:)

\- Replace the cards to other riser/cable slots, and use other functioning cards in that riser slot to see if the card or riser/cable pair is faulty. If this is the case, I just hope it's the riser; otherwise the burnt SATA cables generally damage their port in PSU resulting with a useless blank spot.

All help is appreciated and thank you gratefully in advance.",1548991325.0

I'm hoping this community can set me down the right path. I've been building machines for 20+ years so I'm no stranger to a build but I see a ton of information on super custom rigs here and I'm looking to get as many GPU's as I can fit inside of an LGA1151 platform and a single box.

Any recommendations for a motherboard?

Also, this is for building neural networks so I don't need it to ROI with power consumption.

I've just had a hard time trying to figure out which 1151 motherboard has the most PCI-e channels that runs reliably.

Any suggestions?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the great responses.

FINAL DECISION:

In case future searchers find this, I just wanted to say I went with the x399 platform and a gen2 threadripper. I reduced my storage requirements to a single M2 for fast loading into the cards and no SSD’s outside of that. I also reduced my RAM to 32GB.

I went with a 1200w PSU (high efficiency) for the 2 cards I have and I may potentially get a third 1080ti.

Also, DM me if you’re setting up an ML box like this, I have a one line script that downloads, installs and deploys everything to the box and boots jupyter.",1548908687.0

Every other card just keeps chugging along to the point where the rigs will go months without a restart and me only messing with it to change to a new algorithm and switch to the latest miner.  I've got lots of experience over the last 20 years building PC's, but little experience with the lifespan of GPU's.

Now i have done many hours of research, read countless coin projection assessments and seen a great deal of controversy on this subject. I have my opinions but others have their own.

I feel this would be an appropriate question to bring to the forefront as it does not have a strong sense of what is the right path. 

My personal feeling, as an individual who owns a miner rig that you have two main options. 

1: mine an established coin at a loss knowing you are losing money.

2: switch to a tradable coin and mine efficiently and effectively. Then trade said coin at your own pace and preferred exchange.

Now i understand this is a broad assumption because of the complex nature of the market and constant fluctuations with coin value to mining profit.

I am very curious how other miners approach this, looking to improve my own position and hope to learn a few tips along the way.

Please respond with a few suggestions:

-Better ways to research 
-Exchanges that may offer better options
-Best, up to date and trusted hash rate to gpu calculators 
-Best GPUs, Worst GPUs
-Which Miners are preferred and why
-Miner hardware, mobo suggestions and issues people commonly see with said hardware

-Any other suggestions.

My goal is not to ask, ""BRO like, do you know what the best coin to mine is"". My name is not Jamey newbie. But coins suggested with justification are always welcome.

I never claimed to be an expert but i do have many hours of experience. This said, one can never stop learning which is why i decided to write this post.

Please be nice, be mature and respectful with your response.

Many thank.

The bottom gpu stays cooler than the top (obviously). But I’d like to get a 3rd gpu at some point, however my concern is temps. Watercooling is another $1k+ to do so for me that’s a last resort, and I don’t really have a ton of space for hybrid cards (although I guess I could find space for one).  The 3 would be stacked on top of each other (right now the two I have are in slot 1 and 3 on the motherboard with space in between each other). Temps currently get up to 75-85C when rendering in Octane under high load, so adding a 3rd card could cause a greater concern for heat problems (especially during the summer...). 

What are the best type of gpus to get to keep the card and inside the case cool? Or is it best I just remove the side glass from my case and just have it open (would that be enough)?

&#x200B;

**Why did RX400/500 stomp out competition in ETH-Hash?**

First some quick info on ETH-Hash. It focused heavily on memory because of DAG(directed acyclic graph) creation. The DAG file is located directly in your GPU memory. The Ethereum DAG is a key component for the proof of work algorithm and is generated for each epoch at around every 30,000 blocks. Slowly increasing the amount of memory required to run Eth-hash PoW.

AMD has always kept there mid-range with 256bit-bus and with Polaris paired it with 7-8GBPS GDDR5 memory

>RX 480’s VRAM...Once again common for mainstream AMD cards, AMD has stuck with a 256-bit GDDR5 memory bus here. Attached to this bus is either 4GB or 8GB of VRAM...Officially, 7Gbps GDDR5 is the minimum speed for both RX 480 capacities... However for their 8GB reference card, AMD has opted to ship the card with faster 8Gbps memory in order to further boost performance.

&#x200B;

[Source: Anandtech](https://preview.redd.it/kf4ad5dqima21.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&s=4503d73ba1b30ac3eeb2d722f63b0888ef1663c1)

This along with allowing bios modification that gave access to tighter memory timings allowed them to perfectly match Eth-hash. As Kristy/Ohgodagirl says

>An efficient algorithm for hardware needs to match the access patterns and available space of that hardware. This is why AMD GPUs with firmware edits saw large performance gains on Ethereum — because the access patterns of memory chips were matched to the access patterns of Ethash.

Nvidia's GDDR5X, GTX1060 GDDR5 9GBPS, and GTX1060's with Hynix memory gave terrible hashrates (Until the ETH-PILL for 1080/1080ti)  because they did not match the access patterns of Eth-hash. Anandtech states on Nvidia's implementation for GDDR5X;

>...new GDDR5X memory controllers are also backwards compatible with traditional GDDR5, which in turn is used to drive the GTX 1070 with its 8Gbps GDDR5. The difference in operation between GDDR5 and GDDR5X does make the ROP situation a bit trickier overall for NVIDIA’s architects – now they need to be able to handle two different memory access patterns.

The GTX 1060, RX580's direct price/game competitor, only used a 192-bit bus GDDR5 resulting in a 192GB/sec. Nvidia's used special compression techniques so this wasn't noticeable in games. However it Reduced any Eth-hash performance advantages. The GTX 1070 performed on par with RX400/500 because of the similar GDDR5 speed and 256bit-bus.

&#x200B;

*The AMD ticking-clock of doom (That was avoided)*

AMD GPUs suffer from what known as DAG-thrashing. This happens when the DAG size starts reaching higher memory limits. RX280/380 2/4GB and RX270/370's were the very first affected when Ethereum hit it's 2GB limit. Genoil(Creator of Genoils'Miner) stated since the DAG takes 100% of first memory bank (2gb) once it reaches beyond 2GB it moves to the 2nd memory bank. The GPU has to access two banks instead of just one leading to significant hashrate drop. This is because AMD's GPU designs access 2GB memory banks at 256bit a time(2GB/4GB/8GB). Example 256bit read from 2GB memory bank, 2.5GB of memory needs to be read then the controller switches to the next 2GB memory bank. RX500/400s we're set to suffer in 2017 until AMD released special update ""[Blockchain drivers](https://www.legitreviews.com/amds-new-mining-block-chain-optimized-driver-tested_197095)"" that fixed this issue. This fix did not apply to older AMD GPUs such as 200/300 series.

&#x200B;

Nvidia GTX1060/1070 did not suffer from this issue. I cannot find an exact reason but i summarize is has to do with the differences in how memory is read by the memory controller in the two architectures.

>NVIDIA has reorganized the memory controllers to ensure that each memory controller still operates on the same amount of data. With GDDR5 they teamed up two GDDR5 channels to get 64B operations, whereas with GDDR5X this can be accomplished with a single memory channel.

We are now beyond Epoch 199, currently 234, and even R9 290/390's are suffering from Dag-trashing with users reporting about 27mh/s formally achieving around 30-32mh/s.

&#x200B;

*Hashrate*

(I've personally owned and ran, GTX1060, GTX1070, AMD RX580 on Ethereum)

The RX400/500 performed on eth-hash anywhere from 27-32Mh/s with Bios modifications. Without a BIOs mod anywhere from 22-25mh/s. On average the GTX1060 performed about 20mh/s upwards of 24mh/s with overclocking. Hynix versions performed significantly worse at 16mh/s-18mh/s.  The GTX1070 achieved speeds of 26mh/s-34mh/s without a Bios mod. This put AMD's $200/$230 class of mid-range card up against Nvidia's high-end $400 class of card.

&#x200B;

Without bio's modification the AMD would of seriously been hampered here. It seems Nvidia uses similar access patterns as Eth-hash for there memory timings without the needs for BIOs mod. In a world where both BIOs were locked down Nvidia actually would been the Eth-hash king, not AMD.

*Eth-Power*

It gets tricky here. AMD's power readings from GPU-Z are *not accurate* this is because the reading only take into account parts of the GPU rather than the GPU as whole. Where as Nvidia's is taken as a whole.  How much power is saved all goes off how diligent the miner wants to be with reducing voltage on their GPUs. Additionally GPUs are not created equal and vary from vendor to vendor some being better some being worse. I've personally experienced this with MSI vs XFX with MSI being better as a whole and XFX being hit and miss.

So for this I'm going off my personal experience of what I've seen. My RX580's achieved about 80w\~ (GPU-Z) However the actual power was more along 120w. Voltage settings were 850mv(Core)/900mv(memory). RX480/470s achieved better power savings (as you will see why later on) although i cannot attest to this since I never owned one. Nvidia GTX1070 achieved about 90-100w. Voltage settings for these at 713mv(Using Nvinspector). For GTX 1060s achieved 65-70w at 700mv.

&#x200B;

Aside Linux users will see higher power usage compared to Windows(about 10% higher).

&#x200B;

*Outliers*

Nvidia P104-100 was a card designed with Ethereum mining as it selling point. it was equipped with GDDR5X that matched Eth-hash access patterns. This allowed it to achieved 40Mh/s. however this was not sold retail everywhere mainly only available in Asia. So I'm just going to factor this card as an outlier or a unicorn.

&#x200B;

*Winners and Losers*

Because of how AMD designed the RX400/500 series, this generation ruled Eth-hash mining with excellent price, performance, and low power consumption. Nvidia, on the other hand, took other methods for GTX1060 that allowed it to compete in games, power consumption, but not in Eth-hash mining. The GTX1070 was too expensive for most miners even though it competed metrically similar in Hashrate/Power/Performance just not price. The DAG-thrashing doom almost killed RX400/500, but AMD themselves stepped in and saved them.

&#x200B;

**Claymore's Genius, Dual-mining!**

Since ETH-Hash only required small amounts of 1600p Keccak and under utilized the GPU core, Claymore took advantage of this and create the first ever dual miner. For a while it was very profitable to dual-mine. Today not at all. This was possible on AMD and speeds were astonishing because AMD GPUs have excellent parallel processing. This is why they've always been the miners choice.  Nvidia suffered here. Pascal line could not achieve similar speeds without losing significant hashrate. Turning seems to turn that around, but it's a moot point now. The take-away here is that an under-utilized core allow this to be possible at the cost of extra power consumption.

&#x200B;

**The eternal battle, power efficiency.**

(Note all quotes were taken from Anandtech articles listed above.)

The main crux of ProgPoW, which hits AMD cards more so, is power. ProgPoW is set to increase power consumption on Ethereum across the board. But why? Why does AMD take such huge hit compared to Nvidia? is this favoritism? The short answer is no. To answer why lets explore what Polars brings in terms of power efficeny.

&#x200B;

RX470/480 were well known for there power savings. This is because AMD took a excellent leap forward to bring  back better power consumption with performance. I personally applauded AMD back then. I still have nightmares of my R9 295X I used for gaming consuming 600w!

>...let’s talk about power consumption. As AMD has made clear over the last several months, one of the major goals of Polaris was power efficiency, and this is where we see some of the first payoffs from that decision. RX 480’s official Typical Board Power (TBP) is 150W, over 20% lower than the last-generation R9 380, and 45% lower than the otherwise performance-comparable R9 390

As we moved on AMD upped the core clocks to competitively fight against Nvidia's offerings. Doing so increased power consumption.

>RX 580 is a 185W card, while RX 570 starts at 150W. This is a 30-35W increase in TBPs over the RX 400 series, and given the expected prevalence of factory overclocked cards, the TBP of the average retail SKU is probably a bit higher still.

AMD Losing power efficiency as we advance??

>So as we noted at the RX 500 launch, instead of fighting an efficiency battle that they can’t win, AMD has opted for raw performance and competing on value.

&#x200B;

With the just released RX590. Reducing Power consumption goes straight-out the window.

>For all the gaming performance gains that the RX 590 has made, it came with the higher clockspeeds, and to bring those higher clockspeeds came more power. Already, TBPs have notably increased from the RX 480's 150W to the RX 580's 185W, and now to the RX 590's 225W. Which is already past RX Vega 56's 210W reference board power spec

AMD has now surely lost it's vision back in 2016 to reduce power savings and we're back to R9 290x insane power consumption once again.

AMD has with the RX 590 and Vega, opted to forgo any-power savings in order for raw performance to compete with Nvidia.

>Naturally, the tradeoffs between power efficiency and raw performance is a classic problem of silicon engineering, and it’s been somewhat of a sticking point for Polaris since the beginning. Even though Polaris improved on efficiency over older GCN products, NVIDIA’s top-to-bottom Pascal series brought its own power and clockspeed improvements.

Nvidia Meantime has brought excellent power-savings to Pascal offerings.

&#x200B;

Speaking on power consumption and gaming performance. Lets do a quick dive into gaming and power consumption while gaming. The assumption here is that, maxing the GPU cores means utilizing the GPU architecture thus the results of the power design come out.

A quick shoot over to [Gamers Nexus](https://youtu.be/mIpOx8YUXuU) and we see RX580 power usage during games show's significant disadvantage compared to GTX 1060 let alone the 1070. Mind you GTX 1060 is the direct comparison to the RX580. The GTX 1060 has a 125w TDP, the GTX 1070 has 150w TDP.  This is based off official TDP, not what AIB sometimes go overboard on.

Anandtech uses Crysis 3 to stress there GPUs to achieve the power results i'll show below. It doesn't get pretty for AMD.

>GTX 1060 holds a similarly impressive lead over AMD’s Radeon RX 480. Against the 8GB card, NVIDIA’s mainstream competitor draws 37W less for 14% better gaming performance. Since Maxwell NVIDIA has enjoyed a significant power efficiency advantage, and while AMD’s recent Polaris architecture has helped to close the gap, GTX 1060 proves that NVIDIA continues to execute well here

The GTX 1060 is able to use less power than RX480, AMD's most efficient GPU and gaming wise keep up with it. RX480 uses GTX1070 levels of power but not performance.

[Source:Anandtech.com](https://preview.redd.it/73tum8uzisa21.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=140233fd35db2cf225e5f11550bd60312bd38d46)

RX480 starts off well, but as we progress into the 580 we gain another 30w. Moving onto the RX590(They changed test suite for power) but you can see the take-away. It's mind blowing.

&#x200B;

[Source:Anandtech.com](https://preview.redd.it/81wg99wxjsa21.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=063cc397016139754da3b666672d2152a0b45b06)

Going from an RX480 to an RX590 results in 60w increase in power! let alone AIB partner models that further increase power. As you can see in both tests the GTX 1070 in Crysis 3/BF 1 uses similar power.

&#x200B;

Architecture increasing power efficiency

&#x200B;

**So what's the take-away from this with ProgPoW?**

ProgPoW utilizes the GPU cores(or SM) from both AMD and Nvidia as effectively as possible. However the differences in architecture makes up for the power consumption used from both. RX480's are set to use the least amount of power for AMD however ProgPoW performance will suffer. As we step-up performance, we increase power drastically as well.  GTX1060's look to be set to use the least amount of power with ProgPoW while achieving RX400/500 series performance.

It would be my assumption that an RX590 could reach GTX 1070 level of performance for ProgPoW. AMD cards and Nvidia achieved excellent power savings because Eth-hash never fully load the SM(shader modules) on either GPUs. When the SM's are loaded we start reaching TDPs. I'm obviously not looking at power-savings that could be achieved with some tuning/undervolting, but a general overall look.

Take note that all GPUs will receive a performance hit when ProgPoW is implemented. The theory is 1/2 of Eth-hash rate.

>The general expectation is that ProgPoW should have around half the hashrate of Ethash since it accesses twice as much memory per hash. This holds true for GPUs that utilize GDDR5 memory — the RX 580 and the GTX 1070.

[Why did she choose this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ag0bgu/opinion_asic_resistance_is_a_state_of_mind_not/ee3ez6o), because it was the ""happy"" medium between Nvidia's and AMD's architecture (Utilizes v\_mul\_lo\_u32). In lay-mans terms what ProgPoW does is target the GPU core using reduced Keccak(f800) and other random math while increasing those access patterns that Eth-used by double. Because the switch to ProgPoW initializes more of the GPU core than Eth-hash. As a result see a huge increase in power, similar to as if you were gaming. RX400/500 series power will increase. My RX580 achieved 120w in ETH-hash while testig ProgPoW increased to 180w. My estimates about 60% increase power over ETH-hash. This obviously leaves a lot of unhappy RX400/500 series miners. Because increase in power = reduced profit due to increased power + more spent on electrical upgrading of there farms.

I relate ProgPoW to How claymore achieved Dual-mining. Although the processes that allow it are different, Claymore dual-mining saturated more of the GPU's core leading to an increase in power consumption. So if your wondering why AMD sees an increase in power consumption. Please take a look at how claymore achieved dual mining using Eth-Hash.

&#x200B;

I want to specifically point out here that the fault of such a power increase is because AMD's designs have pushed power limits, higher, and higher. Nvidia meantime has drawn power down while increasing performance, Maxwell, Pascal and finally Turing showed us that have increased performance without increasing power consumption drastically.  *The design of ProgPoW does not aggressively target AMD and force higher power. It's simply AMD's design.*

&#x200B;

**The king will be dethroned.**

This leaves the RX500/400 owners in a sticky spot. Most of the Ethereum network was built on AMD because of it's excellent Watt/hash/cost. The switch to a more GPU intensive algorithm leaves them with less powerful cards than they originally had with ethereum. Additionally ProgPoW takes away any BIOs modification advantage they had in Eth-hash leaving them with stock speeds.

GTX 1060s and RX480/580s achieve similar speeds in ProgPoW, around 9-10Mh/s. They're the direct competitors.  The wattage favors the GTX1060 as I've shown, it's because the GTX1060 is a 125w TDP card while the RX480 is 150w and the 580 185w. Remember, an RX480 @ $230 MSRP was achieving what Nvidia's GTX1070 @ $400 MSRP was. That's a hell of a feat. I know why is was so loved by all miners.

Nvidia has recently has been dominating GPU Intensive algorithms. If it wasn't for the DAG savior, they probably would of went on and dominated Ethereum as well. One only needs to look at X16R/Zhash/X22i/Equihash 150/5, they will understand that performance/watt Nvidia's superior architecture wins the day. Not that AMD's cannot keep up. The problem lies in AMD's design and power usage.

&#x200B;

Edit: [HammerEditior](https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/agnwyc/lets_talk_gpu_differences_nvidiaamd_and_progpow/ee8emcs) has some good information I'd like to add.

>I used to be happy with 28-29 Mh/s on my Polaris cards in the past. 90% of my Ellesmere cards could handle 900 mV core for 1100 MHz. In my real farm they used 125-130w from the grid each (AC 240v, 80+ gold). This was the average over 150 cards. I could've have tuned them down to 120w but chose not to.  
>  
>I do own an RX480. A MSI Gaming X RX480 8GB. It does 10.5 Mh/150w/1050 mV on PROG and 30.0 Mh on ETH. Any lower voltage will cause the system to crash. I'd say the efficiency's slightly better than the RX 580.  
>  
>I think ProgPoW's tuned power usage is 30% higher compared to ETH on AMD cards. If your RX400/500 manages 120w on Ethash, it will get 156w on PROG. If your card does 140 on Ethash, it'll get 182w.

&#x200B;

**Wrap-up**

ProgPoW does what it was designed to do, use the full capacity of the GPU. If the rumors of Navi are true then we may get our RX480 a-like for ProgPoW with excellent power consumption. With Vega VII we may get excellent hashrates but at the expense of power. We won't know for sure till February when it's released.  If ProgPoW brings back decentralized GPU mining at the expense of some power, I'm still for it. It will be up to AMD miners to find ways to achieve a good watt/hash ratio.

>The two main GPU manufacturers would not be so favoured by ProgPoW...will preserve actual hardware investment by GPU miners slowing down the rush to top-class pseudo specialized devices. This does not mean you’ll be able to re-enter the mining business with 3GB GPUs (this will be impossible due to DAG remaining the same as ethash and growing at same pace). Instead ProgPoW balances the memory bandwidth requirements (to access the DAG) with more computation tasks which involve the cores efficiency.  This means the classic underclock of cores is no more effective.

***TL;DR: Differences in GPU Architecture means differences in hashrate/power. ProgPoW levels the playing field for both Nvidia/AMD***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Problem with PoW**

(and what is being done to solve it)

&#x200B;

Proof of Work (PoW) is one of the most commonly used consensus mechanisms entrusted to secure and validate many of today’s most successful cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin being one. Battle-hardened and having weathered the test of time, Bitcoin has demonstrated the undeniable strength and reliability of the PoW consensus model through sheer market saturation, and of course, its persistency.

In addition to the cost of powerful computing hardware, miners prove that they are benefiting the network by expending energy in the form of electricity, by solving and hashing away complex math problems on their computers, utilizing any suitable tools that they have at their disposal. The mathematics involved in securing proof of work revolve around unique algorithms, each with their own benefits and vulnerabilities, and can require different software/hardware to mine depending on the coin.

Because each block has a unique and entirely random hash, or “puzzle” to solve, the “work” has to be performed for each block individually and the difficulty of the problem can be increased as the speed at which blocks are solved increases.

**Hashrates and Hardware Types**

While proof of work is an effective means of securing a blockchain, it inherently promotes competition amongst miners seeking higher and higher hashrates due to the rewards earned by the node who wins the right to add the next block. In turn, these higher hash rates benefit the blockchain, providing better security when it’s a result of a well distributed/decentralized network of miners.

When Bitcoin first launched its genesis block, it was mined exclusively by CPUs. Over the years, various programmers and developers have devised newer, faster, and more energy efficient ways to generate higher hashrates; some by perfecting the software end of things, and others, when the incentives are great enough, create expensive specialized hardware such as ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit). With the express purpose of extracting every last bit of hashing power, efficiency being paramount, ASICs are stripped down, bare minimum, hardware representations of a specific coin’s algorithm.

This gives ASICS a massive advantage in terms of raw hashing power and also in terms of energy consumption against CPUs/GPUs, but with significant drawbacks of being very expensive to design/manufacture, translating to a high economic barrier for the casual miner. Due to the fact that they are virtual hardware representations of a single targeted algorithm, this means that if a project decides to fork and change algorithms suddenly, your powerful brand-new ASIC becomes a very expensive paperweight. The high costs in developing and manufacturing ASICs and the associated risks involved, make them unfit for mass adoption at this time.

Somewhere on the high end, in the vast hashrate expanse created between GPU and ASIC, sits the FPGA (field programmable gate array). FPGAs are basically ASICs that make some compromises with efficiency in order to have more flexibility, namely they are reprogrammable and often used in the “field” to test an algorithm before implementing it in an ASIC. As a precursor to the ASIC, FPGAs are somewhat similar to GPUs in their flexibility, but require advanced programming skills and, like ASICs, are expensive and still fairly uncommon.

**2 Guys 1 ASIC**

One of the issues with proof of work incentivizing the pursuit of higher hashrates is in how the network calculates block reward coinbase payouts and rewards miners based on the work that they have submitted. If a coin generated, say a block a minute, and this is a constant, then what happens if more miners jump on a network and do more work? The network cannot pay out more than 1 block reward per 1 minute, and so a difficulty mechanism is used to maintain balance. The difficulty will scale up and down in response to the overall nethash, so if many miners join the network, or extremely high hashing devices such as ASICs or FPGAs jump on, the network will respond accordingly, using the difficulty mechanism to make the problems harder, effectively giving an edge to hardware that can solve them faster, balancing the network. This not only maintains the block a minute reward but it has the added side-effect of energy requirements that scale up with network adoption.

Imagine, for example, if one miner gets on a network all alone with a CPU doing 50 MH/s and is getting all 100 coins that can possibly be paid out in a day. Then, if another miner jumps on the network with the same CPU, each miner would receive 50 coins in a day instead of 100 since they are splitting the required work evenly, despite the fact that the net electrical output has doubled along with the work. Electricity costs miner’s money and is a factor in driving up coin price along with adoption, and since more people are now mining, the coin is less centralized. Now let’s say a large corporation has found it profitable to manufacture an ASIC for this coin, knowing they will make their money back mining it or selling the units to professionals. They join the network doing 900 MH/s and will be pulling in 90 coins a day, while the two guys with their CPUs each get 5 now. Those two guys aren’t very happy, but the corporation is. Not only does this negatively affect the miners, it compromises the security of the entire network by centralizing the coin supply and hashrate, opening the doors to double spends and 51% attacks from potential malicious actors. Uncertainty of motives and questionable validity in a distributed ledger do not mix.

When technology advances in a field, it is usually applauded and welcomed with open arms, but in the world of crypto things can work quite differently. One of the glaring flaws in the current model and the advent of specialized hardware is that it’s never ending. Suppose the two men from the rather extreme example above took out a loan to get themselves that ASIC they heard about that can get them 90 coins a day? When they join the other ASIC on the network, the difficulty adjusts to keep daily payouts consistent at 100, and they will each receive only 33 coins instead of 90 since the reward is now being split three ways. Now what happens if a better ASIC is released by that corporation? Hopefully, those two guys were able to pay off their loans and sell their old ASICs before they became obsolete.

This system, as it stands now, only perpetuates a never ending hashrate arms race in which the weapons of choice are usually a combination of efficiency, economics, profitability and in some cases control.

**Implications of Centralization**

This brings us to another big concern with expensive specialized hardware: the risk of centralization. Because they are so expensive and inaccessible to the casual miner, ASICs and FPGAs predominantly remain limited to a select few. Centralization occurs when one small group or a single entity controls the vast majority hash power and, as a result, coin supply and is able to exert its influence to manipulate the market or in some cases, the network itself (usually the case of dishonest nodes or bad actors).

This is entirely antithetical of what cryptocurrency was born of, and since its inception many concerted efforts have been made to avoid centralization at all costs. An entity in control of a centralized coin would have the power to manipulate the price, and having a centralized hashrate would enable them to affect network usability, reliability, and even perform double spends leading to the demise of a coin, among other things.

The world of crypto is a strange new place, with rapidly growing advancements across many fields, economies, and boarders, leaving plenty of room for improvement; while it may feel like a never-ending game of catch up, there are many talented developers and programmers working around the clock to bring us all more sustainable solutions.

**The Rise of FPGAs**

With the recent implementation of the commonly used coding language C++, and due to their overall flexibility, FPGAs are becoming somewhat more common, especially in larger farms and in industrial setting; but they still remain primarily out of the hands of most mining enthusiasts and almost unheard of to the average hobby miner. Things appear to be changing though, one example of which I’ll discuss below, and it is thought by some, that soon we will see a day when mining with a CPU or GPU just won’t cut it any longer, and the market will be dominated by FPGAs and specialized ASICs, bringing with them efficiency gains for proof of work, while also carelessly leading us all towards the next round of spending.

A perfect real-world example of the effect specialized hardware has had on the crypto-community was recently discovered involving a fairly new project called [VerusCoin](https://veruscoin.io/) and a fairly new, relatively more economically accessible FPGA. The FPGA is designed to target specific alt-coins whose algo’s do not require RAM overhead. It was discovered the company had released a new algorithm, kept secret from the public, which could effectively mine Verus at 20x the speed of GPUs, which were the next fastest hardware types mining on the Verus network.

Unfortunately this was done with a deliberately secret approach, calling the Verus algorithm “Algo1” and encouraging owners of the FPGA to never speak of the algorithm in public channels, admonishing a user when they did let the cat out of the bag. The problem with this business model is that it is parasitic in nature. In an ecosystem where advancements can benefit the entire crypto community, this sort of secret mining approach also does not support the philosophies set forth by the Bitcoin or subsequent open source and decentralization movements.

Although this was not done in the spirit of open source, it does hint to an important step in hardware innovation where we could see more efficient specialized systems within reach of the casual miner. The FPGA requires unique sets of data called a bitstream in order to be able to recognize each individual coin’s algorithm and mine them. Because it’s reprogrammable, with the support of a strong development team creating such bitstreams, the miner doesn’t end up with a brick if an algorithm changes.

**All is not lost thanks to.. um.. Technology?**

Shortly after discovering FPGAs on the network, the Verus developers quickly designed, tested, and implemented a new, much more complex and improved algorithm via a fork that enabled Verus to transition smoothly from VerusHash 1.0 to VerusHash 2.0 at block 310,000. Since the fork, VerusHash 2.0 has demonstrated doing exactly what it was designed for- equalizing hardware performance relative to the device being used while enabling CPUs (the most widely available “ASICs”) to mine side by side with GPUs, at a profit and it appears this will also apply to other specialized hardware. This is something no other project has been able to do until now. Rather than pursue the folly of so many other projects before it- attempting to be “ASIC proof”, Verus effectively achieved and presents to the world an entirely new model of “hardware homogeny”. As the late, great, Bruce Lee once said- “Don’t get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water.”

In the design of VerusHash 2.0, Verus has shown it doesn’t resist progress like so many other new algorithms try to do, it embraces change and adapts to it in the way that water becomes whatever vessel it inhabits. This new approach- an industry first- could very well become an industry standard and in doing so, would usher in a new age for proof of work based coins. VerusHash 2.0 has the potential to correct the single largest design flaw in the proof of work consensus mechanism- the ever expanding monetary and energy requirements that have plagued PoW based projects since the inception of the consensus mechanism. Verus also solves another major issue of coin and net hash centralization by enabling legitimate CPU mining, offering greater coin and hashrate distribution.

Digging a bit deeper it turns out the Verus development team are no rookies. The lead developer Michael F Toutonghi has spent decades in the field programming and is a former Vice President and Technical Fellow at Microsoft, recognized founder and architect of Microsoft's .Net platform, ex-Technical Fellow of Microsoft's advertising platform, ex-CTO, Parallels Corporation, and an experienced distributed computing and machine learning architect. The project he helped create employs and makes use of a diverse myriad of technologies and security features to form one of the most advanced and secure cryptocurrency to date. A brief description of what makes VerusCoin special quoted from a community member-

""Verus has a unique and new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power which is a 50% PoW/50% PoS algorithm that solves theoretical weaknesses in other PoS systems (Nothing at Stake problem for example) and is provably immune to 51% hash attacks. With this, Verus uses the new hash algorithm, VerusHash 2.0. VerusHash 2.0 is designed to better equalize mining across all hardware platforms, while favoring the latest CPUs over older types, which is also one defense against the centralizing potential of botnets. Unlike past efforts to equalize hardware hash-rates across different hardware types, VerusHash 2.0 explicitly enables CPUs to gain even more power relative to GPUs and FPGAs, enabling the most decentralizing hardware, CPUs (due to their virtually complete market penetration), to stay relevant as miners for the indefinite future. As for anonymity, Verus is not a ""forced private"", allowing for both transparent and shielded (private) transactions...and private messages as well""

If other projects can learn from this and adopt a similar approach or continue to innovate with new ideas, it could mean an end to all the doom and gloom predictions that CPU and GPU mining are dead, offering a much needed reprieve and an alternative to miners who have been faced with the difficult decision of either pulling the plug and shutting down shop or breaking down their rigs to sell off parts and buy new, more expensive hardware…and in so doing present an overall unprecedented level of decentralization not yet seen in cryptocurrency.

Technological advancements led us to the world of secure digital currencies and the progress being made with hardware efficiencies is indisputably beneficial to us all. ASICs and FPGAs aren’t inherently bad, and there are ways in which they could be made more affordable and available for mass distribution. More than anything, it is important that we work together as communities to find solutions that can benefit us all for the long term.

In an ever changing world where it may be easy to lose sight of the real accomplishments that brought us to this point one thing is certain, cryptocurrency is here to stay and the projects that are doing something to solve the current problems in the proof of work consensus mechanism will be the ones that lead us toward our collective vision of a better world- not just for the world of crypto but for each and every one of us.",1547415314.0

I'm in a location with low power costs (.02/kw) and a bunch of larger mining DCs are located here. Following the crash some of these companies are selling less efficient hardware for what, I think, is fairly cheap. $30/unit for Antminer D3s w/PS. Seller guarantees working boards and actually lists units with non-working boards at a discount. Fairly sure he's honest. My interest in them is for image processing and deep learning applications. 

I'm likely to set up these units in a rack and just leave them on, even while not in use. Normally power draw is proportionate to work performed on a system. Is that true with antminers as well or do these things draw 1.2kw just idling? Anyone know what the idle power draw is, if it isn't max?

If anyone here has tried using these rigs for deep learning or image processing, are there any gotchas I should be aware of? I can code and have been a linux admin for years, just don't know what issues I'll run into with specialized GPUs like the antminers have.

Let's go through a short-list of coins that are listed on Nicehash, where hashpower could be bought and then executed a 51% attack.

[BitcoinPrivate 51% (Ethical Hack)](https://news.bitcoin.com/hacker-livestreams-51-attack-on-bitcoin-private/)

&#x200B;

Nicehash has been the #1 to go to ""sell"" hashpower for whatever coin they support for BTC and other rental services such as [miningrigrental](https://www.miningrigrentals.com/). While we cannot prove that this attacks were used by buying hashpower on nicehash, a ethical hacker   
 Geocold lived streamed how easy it was to attack PoW coin BTCP. ""using a couple of hundred dollars’ worth of rented hashpower he’d purchased from Nicehash with BTC"" (bitcoin.com). We can assume then that other 51% attacks all follow this method.

&#x200B;

Step 1. Buy more Hashpower than the current network using rental services

Step 2. moves coins on the true network  to other addresses, makes deposits, then withdraws them to a safe addresses

Step 3. broadcast the untruthful chain to the network

Step 4. this reverts the truthful network.

Step 5. Profit.

>Shockingly, several crypto-currencies not only were cheap to attack but also had plenty of hash rate for sale on NiceHash with which such an attack could take place. When 51% attacks were considered in the past, most calculations included the cost of hardware, electricity, and maintenance. But this new “rent-a-attack” method is proving dangerous for smaller networks. (ccn.com)

This is what happened to ETC recently. Few people who were using nicehash services commented that they noticed a pay-bump mining ETH-HASH.

&#x200B;

>One PoW altcoin team has set up a script to constantly monitor their hashrate. In the event of a spike of over 10%, they will be automatically notified. Should the newly added hashrate emanate from an unknown pool, or be in danger of tipping an existing pool over 50%, they have a large quantity BTC on standby with Nicehash ready to purchase their own firepower to counter the attack (bitcoin.com)

Again it shows the only way that people counter this is to over-bid/buy more hashrate.

&#x200B;

While I understand PoS doesn't suffer from these type of attacks. However I find it unreasonable to say PoW is flawed because 51% attacks. Hashrental services we not envisioned by Satoshi's PoW. Any actual mining actors not using hash rentals would need a sizable amount of resources to perform a 51% and double-spend even on small cap coins. Nicehash takes your money and doesn't care.

&#x200B;

The elephant Crypto needs to deal with it shutting off nicehash and rental services. After the [nicehash hack](https://www.coindesk.com/62-million-gone-cryptocurrency-mining-market-nicehash-hacked) I know I saw a sizable increase in profits because difficulty dropped on so many coins.

&#x200B;

**IMHO Nicehash needs to turn-off purchasing hashrate and instead turn to ""auto-covert"" where they mine the coin that's profitable that day and turn into bitcoin for the user. We wouldn't have the chance of 51% attacks.** ",1547168820.0

The main point from both people is that the ASICs themselves aren't bad, but one big producer holding a monopoly is. 

> We also believe that ASICs are inevitable. If you take a stance of ASIC resistance, typically you just end up with secretly built and operated ASICs. And while secret ASICs are probably better than GPUs, public ASICs are better and decentralized public ASICs are even better still.

As I see it, there are 2 opposing paths a coin's community can take here. I recently learned of option #2.


* 1: Continue resisting ASICs, with ProgPoW, periodic hard forks to knock off ASICs, and change the algorithm. 
* 2: Make the algorithm as simple and streamlined as possible, in the name of lowering the barriers to entry for new ASIC manufacturers. For example: use SHA-128. The lower development costs will mean a dozen companies will start making ASICs, lowering profit margins and prices and eliminating Shitmain's advantage.


Option #1 aims for a utopia world where thousands of small GPU miners drive up the coin's value by telling their friends to invest or build a rig. But the main risk is secret teams of engineers creating secret ASICs, which can screw over the coin's community, like we all know it did to Siacoin, Zcash and ETH. Since the algos required are so complex, well-funded engineers can create devices 2-5x more powerful than the competition and find many optimizations. This is a constant threat and so much time and resources needs to be put into all the hardforks and development.  


Option #2 means accepting ASICs, but making ASICs accessible to everybody, and more importantly making it easy for companies to manufacture an ASIC. The main benefit is since the algorithm would be so simple, it'd be impossible for any engineer to find a secret one-up optimization that makes their ASIC better than the competition. Developing the chip would cost much less. Mining now becomes commoditized because each company makes the same ASIC with the same performance. No manufacturer is dominant now. 

Also, manufacturers now have an incentive to sell the units instead of mine with it themselves, since they won't be making more profit by secretly mining. Might as well sell to consumers before a competing manufacturer releases their new generation. This is *what we currently have with AMD and nVidia*.

Another point is that the popularity of crypto is growing and eventually the market for mining will dwarf the market for PC gaming, meaning we lose the security advantage of piggybacking onto another industry.



What do you guys think is the best choice?? I personally used to be an absolute ASIC hater and supported GPUs, but now I'm starting to change my mind. Allowing ASICs to exist, but making sure they're not monopolized seems to be a viable choice.",1547038523.0

With the current focus on 51% attacks thought it was worth drawing attention to what some coins (like Suqa) are doing to protect against this.

The Suqa devs identified this as a real threat a while ago so entered into an arrangement with Komdo to secure their chain.

Some more info on what this means:

>SUQA Foundation has partnered up with Komodo Platform to utilize a unique security mechanism to protect its own blockchain. Essentially the hashpower of the Bitcoin network is used to protect the SUQA blockchain. This is made possible by storing backups of the SUQA blockchain into the Bitcoin ledger.

>Every ten minutes (Bitcoin average block time) a snapshot is taken of the entire SUQA blockchain. Then this snapshot is written into a block on the Bitcoin blockchain. This process is called notarization and it is the backbone of Komodo’s security mechanism. Komodo Platform’s notary nodes carry out the technical work required to successfully complete notarizations.

Something new PoW coins should consider?  Seems like it is going to be a huge risk for all coins not secured like this, especially if your coin is using an algorithm that has a much larger coin using the same algo.

[This site](https://www.crypto51.app/) is being passed around a fair bit at the moment, makes for some interesting viewing....

Coins that use new algorithms (i.e. without a larger hashrate dedicated to a larger coin) are probably safer than those without, but ultimately using something like Dpow seems like a good idea too for any new coin launching or with low hashrate.

I would be very annoyed to lose any coins my tiny rig mined through an attack :)",1547004235.0

Why Ethereum needs it moving forward.,28,adv764,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/adv764/what_is_progpow_why_ethereum_needs_it_moving/,22,"Update: ASIC Manufacture say they can make a [ProgPoW ASIC](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-miner-linzhi-calls-out-project-coders-for-proposed-asic-ban)

&#x200B;

Disclosure, I'm a avid GPU miner with some 90 Nvidia GPUs running out of my garage. I've been in and out of the mining scene since 2011,2014, and recently 2017. I Hold BTC, ETH, RVN. I directly benefit from them moving to ProgPOW, but not without a good reason. Every-time I've gotten into home GPU mining ASICs comes out BTC, LTC, I've had to give up every time. I refuse to see it happen to another excellent coin.

&#x200B;

I've been a proponent of Ethereum following there ASIC resistance stance outlined in the original white-paper. Now that ProgPOW has been given the *""Green-light""* by Hudson Jameson to move forward with ProgPOW. I really think its time to discuss the Algorithm. What it is, who created it, why Ethereum needs it and dismiss crazy theories such as [Nvidia funding development](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/adc6g5/nvidia_has_funded_the_team_responsible_for_the/).

&#x200B;

Before we start highly suggest everyone watch BitsBeTrippin's video where she breaks down [ProgPOW at devcon4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-CwGNTQ3hY&t=2s).

&#x200B;

**A Quick breakdown of** [What is ProgPOW?](https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW)

>ProgPoW is a proof-of-work algorithm designed to close the efficency gap available to specialized ASICs. It utilizes almost all parts of commodity hardware (GPUs), and comes pre-tuned for the most common hardware utilized in the Ethereum network.

&#x200B;

From reading the white paper listed on Github the main idea behind ProgPOW is NOT to achieve total ASIC-resistance. The idea is to kill the 50-1000x Efficiency gains from specialized ASIC hardware. Such as what we saw  recently with Equihash 200/9 coins where 50x was achieved over GPUs. ProgPOW algorithm uses most of the GPU minus a few parts. It takes the original Eth-Hash algorithm and add more features.

The main elements of the algorithm are:

* Changes keccak\_f1600 (with 64-bit words) to keccak\_f800 (with 32-bit words) to reduce impact on total power
* Increases mix state.
* Adds a random sequence of math in the main loop.
* Adds reads from a small, low-latency cache that supports random addresses.
* Increases the DRAM read from 128 bytes to 256 bytes.

ProgPOW will Inherit Eth-Hash current DAG size meaning 2GB and 3GB will not be able to mine still. Additionally no advantage is given to Either Nvidia or AMD GPUs

>ProgPoW has been designed to be a vendor-neutral proof-of-work, or more specifically, proof-of-GPU. ProgPoW has intentionally avoided using features that only one core architecture has, such as LOP3 on NVIDIA, or indexed register files on AMD.

&#x200B;

According to Kristy, she has had direct contact with AMD and Nvidia on testing ProgPOW.

>As part of its review process, ProgPoW was submitted to (and reviewed by) both AMD and NVIDIA engineers. The group known as IfDefElse — of which I am a part of — has been actively working with both companies to ensure this effectively closes the efficiency gap that we speak publicly of in our papers and articles

This does not mean one side is favored over the other.  She's giving and getting input from the major GPU manufactures in order to support Crypto-mining. Additionally she says ""AMD is actively working with us to optimize ProgPoW for their architectures."". Using ProgPOW optimized for GPUs rids us of bowing to Bitmain, innosilicon, halong and there scandalous ways for hardware.

&#x200B;

ProgPOW IS NOT the ""God-sent savior of all GPUS"" Even Kristy understand that complete ASIC-resistance is a fallacy. This will never be achieved. However By working with GPU manufactures and Crypto Dev's we can make a coin where GPUs run along-side with ASICs, but the efficiency gains are diluted. Meaning the time and money invested into an ProgPOW ASIC machine does not make economical sense. Rather just buy the actual GPU.

&#x200B;

**Why does Ethereum need ProgPOW?**

&#x200B;

I suggest reading [Siacoin's](https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-cryptocurrency-mining-538004a37f9b) good medium article on the subject of ASICs.

It's too much to cover here but in short why we need ProgPOW against current ASICs

At his point in time we actually don't need ProgPOW. However we do need it as time goes on. Early Bitcoin ASICs didn't dominate BTC however as time went on, they became better more efficient than GPUs, and started dominating BTC's network. The same fate happens to any ""ASIC-Resistant coin"" that decides it's not a big deal *(looking at you ZEN).* Without a set date on POS Ethereum would have suffered the same fate. As Siacoin Dev states;

>We also had loose designs for ethash (Ethereum’s algorithm). Admittedly, ethash was not as easily amenable to ASICs as equihash, but as we’ve seen from products on the market today, you can still do well enough to obsolete GPUs.

What makes ASICs bad? Isn't it better to get Hash/watt ratio? This saves tons of electric. One of PoW biggest faults. I think there is nothing bad about the ASICs hardware. Equihash ASICs achieved 20 1080ti level hashrate at 1/20 of the power. That's impressive. The problem with ASIC hardware is who, where it comes from, and there shady business practices.

&#x200B;

1. ""It’s estimated that Monero’s secret ASICs made up more than 50% of the hashrate for almost a full year before discovery, and during that time, nobody noticed."" How much of ETH hashrate could be ASICs? We won't know till the fork.
2. I've heard a lot that ASICs aren't all that big of a deal. Focus on POS. Take in account Siacoins own network hashrate which allowed bitmain/innosilicon ASICs on the network till they forked in favor of their own ASICs after just a year ([Siacoins drops 96% network hashrate](https://1stminingrig.com/what-is-siaclassic-and-should-you-mine-it-review/)).
3. ""In the case of Halong’s Decred miner, we saw them “sell out” of an unknown batch size of $10,000 miners. After that, it was observed that more than 50% of the mining rewards were collecting into a single address that was known to be associated with Halong, meaning that they did keep the majority of the hashrate and profits to themselves."" GPU manufactures would not and cannot be do the same.

ASICs destroy networks, [centralize the pools](https://www.ccn.com/bitmains-mining-pools-now-control-nearly-51-percent-of-the-bitcoin-hashrate/), and hardware. Leading to them to be controlled by large entity in this case its Chinese companies. Anyone who thinks otherwise is fool. Of course this doesn't happen overnight, hence my original statement that we don't need ProgPoW now. In a years time that may totally change and it will be far to late.

&#x200B;

GPUs allow anyone to support the network. Think of the crypto run-up. Fry's Electronics, Microceneter, online E-tailers were SOLD OUT OF GPUs. Think of that! People were buying GPUs to support the network for token rewards(worth money) How many new miners, people, got interested in crypto because of this? How about friends who saw the rigs and word of mouth spread that you could go out buy a graphics card, built a rig, and earn money? obviously we know the effects because it wasn't sustainable in the remotest. However it's an attest that GPU mineable coins makes it accessible to everyone.

&#x200B;

For Ethereum to successfully go POS it cannot hand it network over to ASIC mining companies in the meantime. POS is on an unknown release date/timeframe. I understand Vitalk does not like PoW however that's what currently securing the network. Because of this Ethereum must maintain as much decentralization as possible with GPU mining. This is what ProgPOW does. It gives AMD and Nvidia GPUs the advantage they need over ASICs created by Bitmain or others. It allows me to continue to secure the Ethereum network with my 90 GPUs until full POS switch.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Did it have to be ProgPOW? No, as UBIQ has shown they created there own unique ASIC-resistant algorithm. ProgPOW was given to us by the Ifdefelse team completed. This required no work from the ETH devs at all. It's open source and has been reviewed by the Etheruem Dev team. If they haven't found any issues with it yet, I don't see why we cannot implement it.

&#x200B;

An argument can be made that if we do switch we risk security, because we'll lose network hashrate and decrease the cost to attack the network. I have two things to say to that. One, since ProgPOW is new, Nicehash has not added it to it's network to rent yet. I wouldn't know how long nicehash would take to it add it, but it gives us a short while to get people on new ETH POW network. Additionally to attack the network, they would need massive coordination from GPU mining farms. Such a thing has never been recorded.

&#x200B;

The 51% attacks that have happened recently (BCD/BTG/ZEN) and as of 1/8/18, ETC. These were all ASIC mineable coins. In the case of equihash coins, an ASIC that achieved 50x more efficiency  had just came to market. It's not proven, but it leads me to believe a bad actor with early access to ASICs was able to attack those coins. All except ZEN have switched to Zhash algorithm. Even ZCASH/Zelcash has funded ProgPOW development. While I disagree they should do this, because that's entirely the problem too many coins using too many of the same algorithm, in the end it's up to the devs.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR; ASIC-Resistance is futile and a fallacy. PoS or other solutions are needed but to get there we need to keep PoW as Decentralized as possible this is what ProgPOW does.

I’m hoping I could get y’all’s insight on an issue I encountered last night. 

So for the background, I mine in my apartment (nothing in the lease forbidding it). I have a 6-GPU mining frame, plus a 2-GPU gaming desktop. 

My GPU inventory is: 4x1080Ti, 1x1070Ti, 1x1070, 1xVega 56, 1xRX570.  (Yeah, it’s a frankenrig)

The 3 PSU’s (all EVGA 850W G2 Gold... 1 in desktop, 2 on rig) are connected to their own UPS’s. The desktop UPS is an Eaton 5S1500LCD, with a maximum wattage supply of 900W before it starts beeping. The monitors, Ethernet switch, and speakers are also connected to that battery backup. The 2 rig UPS’s are Eaton 5S1000LCD, which can supply 600W before they start warning me. (I’m highlighting this watt limit to explain why I doubt I was overloading the circuit. ). In general, I pull in the 450-550W range on the Desktop, and the 500-575W range on the rig PSU’s. 

The 2100W supply limit means that the rig and desktop can pull about 17.5A before starting to alarm. (I live in the US, so we have 120V power here). 

Also in the room is a ceiling fan, home printer (canon inkjet), and a small tower air purifier. 

I’ve been mining since March of 18 (yeah, I got on the bandwagon a bit late... what kills me is that I had my gaming desktop most of 2017, with 1080Ti’s in SLI... I coulda made bank... :/ ), and haven’t had any issues with the breaker tripping. Until last night. 

The breaker for that room says it’s a 20A breaker. So basically, I’m positive I’ve been good on keeping things within the green. 

Last night, I was fixing dinner, and heard the breaker trip. The UPS’s had not beeped, so I know they didn’t pull more than their maximum theoretical Amperage. I checked the room, didn’t smell any smoke, so I went and reset the breaker. (On the plus side, the UPS’s kept the mining going! Yay!). I went back to the rig, started checking the overclock settings to make sure things weren’t off on power limits. Less than 2 minutes after resetting the first time, the breaker tripped again. I immediately shut everything down, and reset the breaker. 

This morning, I restarted the rig, but only activated the trading bot, so minimal power draw. No trips so far. 

So, now that I’ve written a novel, does anyone have any thoughts as to why this could be happening? I’m wondering if the circuit breaker could be fatigued or something? I doubt that residential circuit breakers are meant to be run at 50-75% load continuously long term.
I am gonna contact maintenance for my apartment, but I do want to try preventing this from happening again...

Thanks in advance!

I have a 5 GPU rig with a 1500W PSU. It's been mining since Feb2018 just fine. Now if I try to mine with all 5 GPUs (850W) I get spotty internet and pool disconnects. If I disable (any) 2 GPUs (550W) it will mine fine. This is with various miners (NiceHash, T-Rex on RVN, Phoenixminer on ETH). Nothing has changed except that I did pick the rig up and move it, and then move it back. Not sure what could have been jostled; the risers are inserted and like I said it doesn't follow a specific GPU anyway. WiFi interference based on wattage? The fact that it just started baffles me.

EDIT: thanks for all of the help everyone! moving the rig next to the router made no difference but hooking up a direct ethernet line fixed the problem and so the problem appears to be a junkie USB Wi-Fi adapters. (I tried turning off USB power saving modes but that didn't help.)

EDIT#2: I'm not really sure how to explain this, but the root cause was that I reduced Virtual Memory allocation in Win10 to less than the total available GPU mem. Although a direct ethernet connection fixed the problem (????) the problem came back when back on wifi. After fixing the virtual memory, it now works on wifi again. I have no idea how or why this all works, but the only wild guess I can come up with is that when low on memory windows was doing strange things like disabling the wifi adapter (which would not be necessary on a direct ethernet connection?)  I should also add that the 60GB required for virtual memory, combined with Win10 itself, comprises the vast majority (over 90%) of the drive space.

The Go-ahead has been given for ProgPOW(barring any major problems) Time-line looks to be 3 months\~ or next quarter to fully implement ProgPOW. ProgPOW will be its own native HF. Nothing else will be included into it.

First the good news,

*Peter Pratscher-*""As the gangnam ProgPoW testnet is running smoothly since a few weeks & the mining ecosystem is maturing (open source implementations for cuda & opencl are more or less done, claymore (the dev of the most widely used closed source gpu ethash miner) has also confirmed to add ProgPoW support to his miner) I think it would be a good time to finalize the discussion if Ethereum should switch to ProgPoW during the next core dev call?""

Claymore and I'm sure PhoenixMiner team are behind creating ProgPOW miners for ETH-hash.

ProgPOW WILL be coming to Ethereum.  It's just a matter of when?

Bad news-

Discussion will have to take place to decided ""When"" to include it, either on the current release cycle of 8 months or Ad-hoc.  It's unlikely that ProgPOW will be included in next HF, but they're may be an Ad-hoc HF that would include it.

I was frustrated by the lack of PPS mining pools for MNX in North America. So i created one-- and released it into the wild.

https://mnx.miningfool.com

Why PPS?

PPS is important to me because 5 hours out of the day electricity is too expensive (peak hour pricing)... So i need to turn off my miners during this time. Overall, I get a huge savings on my electric bill if I go with this plan. PPLNS will punish me too much for going offline for 5 hours, and PROP is not fair because of pool hoppers exploiting it... Therefore I prefer PPS.

If there is anyone like me out there, you now have one more PPS option in North America for MNX Mining :)

957,Titan V HMB2 degredation?,0,abc2tf,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/abc2tf/titan_v_hmb2_degredation/,20," 

Anyone have information to share about titan V, HBM2, how the card regulates voltage as the chip ages?

I have a strong suspicion that there is some sort of runtime clock equivalent or predictable decay of some component that the power delivery system reads and stairsteps down voltage to protect the chips, much like apple protecting their batteries with lower clock speed. I know for sure the first few weeks i had great performance. then about every 2 months i wake up one day to a noticeable decay in performance.

also i could have sworn voltage and temperature degrade chips. NOT clock speed. if voltage and temperature and static, any clock speed with have roughly the same degradation effect, no?

I have 3 titan V's running claymore since september.

watercooled at around 35c no more than 50 if ambient is over 35c

\-200 core only a memory overclock. titan v has no voltage controls just power.

originally running around 57 power, now i'm up to 64 with much worse performance.

after about 1 week one of the cards lost stability and had to lower the mem clocks from +235 to +215. over the past 3 months thats dropped to 210 and now 205.

the other two cards were always stable at +235 but today they lost stability. tried installing them in a different system and after hours of troubleshooting found the exact same results. strangely at the end of it all, i get 235 stable again but at 87MH/s instead of 90. i was getting over 90MH/s for about a week. the slowest one always got 88MH/s slowly down to 87 and has now has instantly dropped to 84.5MH.

Nvidia has no way of proving what i'm doing with these cards, and if they detect i'm running them 24/7 i will give them specific work i was doing 24/7 that was not mining. i fully intend to run them into the ground and have them replaced as often as possible before my 3 year warranty is up. please no discussion about this last part, just wanted to mention it.",1546324624.0

1. How can I reach BIOS screen? The monitor lit up only when ubuntu login window appears.
2. why the VGA LED light is always on while the monitor connecting to the GPU (rx580) light up successfully after ubuntu login window arrived?

=========== . long story =================

By the first time using this MB (motherboard), Bios screen was reached and settings were done by me.

Then I installed ubuntu18 headless and added multiple GPUs with PCI-risers.

At some point (I dont know when and why), the VGA LED was always on (never go away) after each time the machine booting up. But I didn't pay much attention as the system can boot into ubuntu successfully. I thought it was because of the riser-way made the system false detecting GPUs.

Today I tried to reinstall ubuntu and realized that I cannot reach BIOS screen, my monitor always goes straight to ubuntu login window. I did the troubleshooting below:

1. I removed all GPUs and risers, insert directly one GPU into MB without riser. The same issue remains.
2. the VGA LED light in MB is always on after the machine turning on.
3. If I do not touch keyboard, the monitor will lit up once the machine reaches the ubuntu login window.
4. If I hit F2, DEC, F12 in keyboard before machine enters ubuntu login window, the monitor will not lit up at all. I suspect machine enters BIOS stage while monitor cannot detect.
5. If I plugin a ubuntu install media USB, monitor won't lit up.
6. If I unplug the ubuntu SSD disk, monitor won't lit up.
7. If I remove the BIOS battery from MB, machine will auto-reboot 2-3 times, but afterwards all symptoms above remains (This is the weirdest thing. MB doesn't go back to factory settings!!!????)

Repeat my questions:

1. How can I reach BIOS screen? The monitor lit up only when ubuntu login window appears.
2. why the VGA LED light is always on while the monitor connecting to the GPU (rx580) light up successfully after ubuntu login window arrived?

Everyone is missing important factors.,13,a92uqx,gpumining,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/a92uqx/mining_vs_buying_crypto_everyone_is_missing/,67,"I've seen a lot of discussion about Mining coins vs buying them due to the bear market. I think people are thinking too linear such as buying ETH vs mining ETH.

&#x200B;

**Cases for mining Crypto**

1. Buidl a mining rig at say $4000, in one year time that (Potentially) could pay for itself. There's no other investments you could make that could do that.
2. Self-managed. The miner decided what coin to mine, can swap from coin to coin(GPU mineable coins of course)
3. The most important thing is here as I stated is being able to flip to coin to coin mining whatever is profitable(Only considering that we are trying to ROI). *This includes low or NO market cap coins!* RVN was NOT available to buy on any exchanges for months after its release. Cryptobridge then later Cryptopia where the only exchanges to buy/sell RVN in the first 6 months. Also consider that, since RVN blew up in less than a year, one could have been mining from the start earned plenty of coins then sold off during its last run-up and made double or more than what the rig cost.
4. Building a rig can be many things. Learning the Hardware, OS, etc. You can make it look very neat, with LED lights/fans(considering Hobby miners here) that you could show off to friends and family. You gain overall IT experience.
5. A constant stream of coins rather than setup repeat buy orders and having to watch prices like a hawk to get at low prices.

**Cases for** **Buying Crypto**

1.  A fairly simple process now depending on how you do it. Get setup at an exchange such as Gemini or Coinbase in order to get FIAT transfer to BTC. Just buy BTC then trade for coins. 
2. Buying to HODL. Investments are far simpler you just need to buy a coin. $4000 investment now will grant you one BTC. Depending again on market factors could double your money in less than a year.
3. No intrinsic costs such as Rig setup/downtime/fixing problems
4. Save on recurring electric costs 

&#x200B;

**My personal opinion**

I work as Hardware Analyst for a company, so it's just in my nature to play with computer hardware, it's a fun hobby for me. It's even better when that hobby generates its own income! So I always build my rigs and set to mining. Of course, I keep my overhead costs extremely low. Run everything out of my garage. A friend helped build rig housings. I have cheap electric rate of .09kw/c.  All these factors should be taken if you going to be doing it seriously and dropping more than 10G into it.

&#x200B;

**Mining Success?**

I generally think many ""miners"" are lazy. They fail to research upcoming projects that could hit it big. To be truly successful YOU MUST find new projects to mine and ""gamble"". You can always play it safe and could well ROI but you'll never see great returns, end of 2017 beginning of 2018 with the run-up being the exception. Don't expect that again anytime soon. 

&#x200B;

You must Pay attention to what is going on in the crypto-sphere.  When do coins half there block rewards? How does PoW actually work? What the best miner to use to maximize coins etc. There are tons of small factors that add.

Presumably you have a source of electricity that costs $X and a rig capable of turning $X of electricity into $Y of crypto (hopefully Y > X). What % of that $Y of crypto would you say typically needs to be sold back into local currency to pay for electricity the next month? Versus HODLing the crypto? My guess is this might also depend on market sentiment -- am I right?

And if miners do need to sell, how do they go about doing that? Seems like if a bunch of miners were constantly dumping on exchanges it would create a lot of downward price pressure.... is that happening? Are there some exchanges that are better for this purpose than others?

And last question to anyone kind enough to read my post -- do your rigs live in your house or office, or do you have them in some remote location with cheaper electricity costs?

\-Binance now donates its listing fees to its own charity (perhaps dubious, to be fair).

\-Resistance DEX will introduce new proof-of-research concept, where a portion of the computing power used to mine its blockchain's native token will be donated to BOINC for the advancement of various scientific causes.
