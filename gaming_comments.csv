0,Wow must be nice to spend it with someone
1,Never heard of it.
2,Beat Hazard and Crypt of the Necrodancer
3,There is an audiosurf 2 :3c
4,"Crypt looks ridiculously hard, but comes highly recommended. Haven't seen anything about Beat Hazard, not even a Let's Play, so I'll check that out."
5,"For the record, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rogue-lite game."
6,"Ikr, I feel with the technology available today and a decent mod support, it could be the ultimate multiplayer universe simulator. Would never need another game ever again.... hmm... maybe that's why."
7,"While it isn't spore 2, I would recommend looking at thrive by revolutionary games. They have big plans for it although it isn't much yet."
8,"Oh so you like EA games?
Name every microtransaction"
9,Hasn't it taken them like seven years to create the cell stage beta?
10,Life.
11,"hahaha, thats true!"
12,"Everyone: What‚Äôs up with HL3?

Steam: Here‚Äôs a VR sex game."
13,I think people love it so much because of the building style and all of the minigames online has to offer. I have never played subnautica but I'll try it out soon to compare it to minecraft's survival mode.
14,"I agree, Minecraft survival is fun but I tap out at maybe 2-3 hours per week, but I think it has massive potential in the form of mods and major updates"
15,Thats why there is things called mods in most survival games  so you can make the game better in survival ways
16,"     I find that minecraft drives it praise from the fact that its simplicity paired with good mechanics, provide hours of fun with friends. I dont think subnautica is the best thing to compare minecraft to as it is much less simple and is usually single player."
17,"As far as survival goes, the base game is not challenging without mods. But keep in mind, Minecraft would not get the praise it does without the creative mode. You may not be a creative person, but go see some of the amazing things people have made with it, mods or not:

https://youtu.be/yPxcldEDHts

It definitely deserves the praise."
18,I don‚Äôt like to play alone but it‚Äôs hella fun with a bunch of friends
19,"I grew up when minecraft didnt existed I played TES 3, and it was fun"
20,"I played a lotttt of Minecraft
But since i found mods it was Extra fun"
21,"Blah, blah, blah, Minecraft good. Fortnite bad."
22,A truly amazing game shouldn't require modding to be fun.
23,I 100% that its creative mode is prolly the most accessible and well designed creation tool ever in gaming my complaints lie with the base game.
24,Minecraft pretty alright Fortnite bad
25,"People mod gta all the time it‚Äôs all in your playing style, how old are you? Most of us grew along with Minecraft"
26,I grew up with minecraft as well ever since it was first released on xbox 360
27,Have you played it ever since it released to 360
28,yea just yesterday actually
29,No have you played from day 1
30,from console day one yes
31,Doom
32,Titanfall 2
33,God of War
34,Steamrolling an opposing nation and conquering a continent in Civ is pretty damn empowering
35,Any dynasty warrior game. :)
36,X-Plane 11
37,Destiny 2. I taught my son to raid and flawless end game content. He‚Äôs 7. Nothing makes me feel more powerful than raising the next generation of guardians.
38,"(In)famous 1 & 2. That electric superpower is so cool. No weapons, you are the weapon. If that doesn't make you feel powerful I don't know what would.

Also doom and titanfall."
39,"GTA V while on rage mode , Doom 2016 , Max payne 2 and 3"

48,All of them or any particular flavor?
49,Hell yes!
50,"God of War, Bayonetta, Dante's Inferno.

MMMm sooo good."
51,Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2!
52,"Gaming with my son is awesome!

I like to imagine the future is just all of our collective ancestors playing video games together."
53,"There's a reason Insomniac made such a solid Spiderman game it is because of how much love and effort they put into the infamous serious first.

My favorite Infamous was Second Son."
54,"I remember when Max Payne and the Matrix games introduced bullet time.

I thought it was so fucking cool to run and wall jump spin kick a bad guy in the face.

And you know what? It is fucking cool!"
55,The Force Unleashed 1 & 2 are great gems!
56,"Did you ever play Titan Quest?

Similar themes to God of War but with a Diablo-style gameplay system."
57,I'm just waiting on the expansion for Sw/Sh so I can expand my living dex and maybe do more shiny hunting ( got burned out after I finished my shiny comp team )
58,King K. Rool here. Long live the king!
59,Pirate Warriors 3!
60,He takes my skill and suggestions and bends them in ways I can fathom. He‚Äôs the kind of player to make a point of helping people. I‚Äôm grateful for that.
61,"No, but now i know haha, thanks  for the suggestion"
62,"My son is like ""Dada, SEE!?"" and then he points to his mario maker level that I then have to play. He's 3 :)"
63,It's usually pretty cheap on steam and goes on sale all the time. If you don't want to drop the cash now I suggest adding it to your wishlist and just waiting for it to be $5 or less.
64,Start em young. He began with Mario and deleting my destiny 1 guns lol. He plays a pretty wide variety. He cleared his first raid at 6. And continues to set new bars. His goal is to play with Gladd one day.
65,"This is a really common problem / theme in this sub. I have also tried asking, but I‚Äôve hard hardly any luck finding something that‚Äôs couch co-op. 

I‚Äôve just been making everyone play overcooked with me. It‚Äôs fun, lighthearted, and is a good game to see how well you work together."
66,Speedrunners is a cool couch co-op game with support for up to 4 players
67,Enter the gungeon has fun 2- player couch coop. Also stick fight is an amazing 4-player game
68,Borderlands is always great for coop/splitscreen
69,"The new Call is Duty has couch co-op. I have seen it in the menus but never in action. 

My wife and I really like Overcooked on my Xbox. Pretty fun. There‚Äôs definitely fewer options these days."
70,"On Xbox I‚Äôve tried:
Overcooked
Munchkin (and other silly brawlers)
Rocket League"
71,Many of the LEGO games are good co-op experiences. They‚Äôre geared for kids but can still be fun to play with a friend
72,"You can try Human: Fall Flat. Itsfun and chill, and I really enjoyed playing it with my friends!"
73,"7 Days to Die is a ""Minecraft meets zombies"" survival/crafting game that offers both online play and couch co-op. My wife and I play it pretty often together."
74,maybe RE6
75,Yes
76,That only game I've ever played that gives me headaches and makes me nauseous.  That art style in motion is horrid to me.
77,"I never would have considered Call of Duty, but if you could play online in splitscreen, then that would be cool.  

I feel like we wouldn't get much playtime out of overcooked.  I've watched a lot of gameplay and it seems like a $10 game to me."
78,"I forgot that I had wanted to look at 7 Days to Die.  I really want it on my PC, but if I want to play it with my girlfriend, I'll have to buy it on PS4 too.  I think I was trying to avoid buying the same game twice.  That defiantly seems like a good option.  Might be a bit too slow paced when Resident Evil 6 is an option."
79,"Developer was sick, we have to deploy ir anyway. Long story."
80,First witcher comes to mind.
81,Neverwinter nights 2
82," The Witcher 1-3

Greedfall

Btw Dragon Age had isometric view on PC, so naming something like the amazing Divinity Original Sin 2 is valid too."
83,Mass effect maybe? Console it pc view?
84,Baldur's Gate 2
85,"DOOM 2016 is an absolutely incredible game. At $15 its an absolute STEAL. 

DOOM 2016 is the best FPS i have ever played."
86,2016 is a solid game. I like it
87,It's definitely worth it's $15 dollar price tag so if u can swing it then do it üëç
88,Buy it
89,Yes
90,"It's great, you should definitely get it. Doom Eternal has some new stuff in the mechanics which may change the feel a bit, make it more tactical, 2016 is pure raging instinct for the most part."
91,"Totally worth it.
Amazing game."
92,"Just finished it on PC, awesome awesome game. Do buy"
93,F‚Äòin buy it now!
94,"Alright, since everyone can't help but praise this game I guess it's worth it. Thanks for replies everyone. I'll buy it tomorrow. üòä"
95,If you got Xbox I thinks it's on Xbox game pass
96,buy Animal Crossing
97,Well if it's as good as you and everyone else say it is I guess it's worth it.
98,Doom 2016 that is
99,"Buy both, they're very similar."
100,"Doom dosen't have Froggy Chair,maybe as a DLC ?"
101,"*n√§men se man p√•, en svenne*"
102,Region locked?
103,Some codes are. Like a lot of game keys are
104,Can confirm it's on sale on PS4 (US).
105,It‚Äôs a dollar cheaper on PS4
106,"Ubi store has it for 10 euro, where are y‚Äôall seeing this?"
107,On which online store is it sold for PC?
108,Ubisoft
109,"I wish I could have fell in love with it like everyone else, just couldn't after playing it for a few hours"
110,It‚Äôs a great game with a huge world to explore
111,"I‚Äôm about 6 hours in. I love it so far. I also started watching the Netflix show. Geralt is a pretty bad ass character. 

Oh make sure to kill all the cows and animals you find. It helps you get money early on!"
112,"Be ready for 100+ hours of playtime. I‚Äôm still working on it since it came out on GamePass. 140+ for me so far, I haven‚Äôt even started the DLC."
113,have fun buddy
114,Wish you the best journey!
115,You are looking at an amazing playthrough
116,"It wasn't for me, but I hope you enjoy it."
117,Jealous you‚Äôre getting to experience this for the first time. Absolute masterpiece.
118,The first and the best!
119,Good to see more people digging into this hidden gem
120,"I‚Äôm not a very big fan of RPGs but this is on Game Pass and ive heard really good things about so, I‚Äôm giving it a try."
121,"I have the same problem, and I *know* it's me not the game...

To each their own I guess. I should probably go read the books."
122,"Same here. I've tried twice.

I don't think it's a bad game, or tell people they're wrong for liking it because I didn't, but it's not for me. At least, it's not a game I liked enough to play for 80-100 hours, when I have tons of other games to play and books I want to read.

I remember being so excited when The Witcher II finally came out for Xbox. I rushed to the store to get it, brought it home and just couldn't get into it. I normally love RPGs, and fantasy RPGs, but the preparation, spells and difficulty aren't for me.

Got The Witcher III for free, but couldn't get into it both times.

The gameplay is a bit rough, as well."
123,Yeah. I‚Äôm really really looking forward to it.
124,Thanks
125,The best advice.
126,"""Hidden gem""??!?!!

The Witcher series is one of the most hyped and recognized names in computer game history. There's a TV show based on it. How is this hidden?"
127,"The movement kills me. I love Skyrim but the big reason I think I don't like Witcher is how restrictive the movement feels in comparison. It's just not for me

I really wish I could like it, the characters are really flushed out and enjoyable"
128,"Try not to rush through the main quest line, side quest are just as fun"
129,"thatsthejoke.jpg

Not saying it's funny, but that joke is made basically everytime the game is posted on here."
130,"Witcher 3 was not but Witcher was, especially since it was a PC only release."
131,"It's the spells, the strategy, the before battle preparation, and that type of thing that doesn't interest me. I don't want to have to prepare for each battle, or remember tons of things."
132,What game is that from? I know I've seen that hint before.
133,This takes me [back. ](https://doomwiki.org/w/images/thumb/6/6a/Protip.jpg/250px-Protip.jpg)
134,I may be stupid but i aint dumb
135,Go pick up some business hammocks from the hammock district.
136,Doesn't this belong in r/gameprotips?
137,"Pffft barbarian says ""I no need hp have cleric can berserk into negative hp cleric pray get back up everything ok!"""
138, This is from assassins creed odyssey!
139,I think it‚Äôs WoW.
140,"also left handed. unless gaming on m&kb truly feels awkward, you prob just suck. most people grow up using a mouse in their right hand. you become used to it."
141,I mean ya probably just suck but a right handed mouse on a lefty ain't helpin
142,"one thing to note is that there are different styles and shapes of mice. i had a lot of trouble aiming when i first started gaming on my pc because i bought some razer mouse that everyone said was good. when my dad needed a new mouse for his pc, i bought him a used logitech mx518 because it was cheap. i remember testing it out on my pc and there was an immediate improvement. the difference mouse shape, weight, and speed makes is huge.

could left vs right handed mice make a difference? sure. but my guess is mouse grip, shape, and dpi matter a lot more. it might take some experimenting to find a store that has all types of mice but i would definitely walk in and try to see how some mice feel if you can"
143,"Can confirm as Im left handed. 

We got it rough. The world is a backwards place to us southpaws. 

Gotta force yourself to become ambidextrous only way youll survive"
144,I agree with you that you become used to it but what if it's easier lefthanded. Like I can throw a ball or write with my right hand but it won't be nearly as accurate or precise as if I used my left. What if it's the same for a mouse a and keyboard
145,"> What if it's the same for a mouse a and keyboard

only way to know for sure is to try it"
146,"Its only that way because you have way more experience using the left to write. Youre welcome to get a left ganded moyse and train yourself to use it.

As a lefty, i dont have any issues using a regular mouse on my right hand."
147,Bro I'm highly considering idk how I've never thought about this
148,But if you write right-handed for long enough you'll see improvements. This really is jsut a concept of a higher level of potential. Like could I be eventually better using a lefthanded mouse than if I just stuck with right? This actually has me questioning everything I've done in life
149,"You could swap the mouse to the left side? Just to see how it feels before you buy a ""left handed mouse"""
150,How far we've come.
151,"
OH how I miss playing quake"
152,"its not that difficult, you just learn your enemies attack pattern then you dodge and hit. mind you its not that easy"
153,"The approach is very similar to Cuphead. The bosses have patterns and tells and you have a variety of weapon choices to match your play style.

If you have the patience to S rank Cuphead, you've probably got the patience for Dark Souls."
154,"The start is probably the hardest part of darksouls. The games tend to give you little guidance, and almost everything murders you instantly. Once you get past that part (and I recommend reading a beginners guide to at least understand how your carry weight effects your dodge roll), you'll probably be ok. And you can start to grind some enemies to level up and make it easier for yourself.

So in essence, the hardest part of Dark Souls is having the patience to keep trying for the first couple of hours until everything clicks. If your patient, then give it a try.

I'm not the best gamer (probably average at best) but I got through DS2 and DS3 ok (I played DS1 first, got completely lost and never came back to it)"
155,"The biggest thing I had to learn is that Dark Souls is not a hack‚Äôn‚Äôslash. I was getting ruined early on by just running up and trying to attack enemies. It takes more care and patience than that at first, until you learn enemy behavior. Then you can go for it. I loved the world so much that I stuck with the challenge, and you might as well."
156,I've been looking for a game to occupy my time til doom eternal so dark souls remastered is the game ive most been considering
157,"Because its an RPG you can use stats to your advantage. Get a bit more health or strenght and you can beat the boss that was a wall for the last few days. Dark Souls is also pretty open, so if you are stuck on a boss you can try another way and come back later. the semi open world gives you the opportunity to discover hidden paths or hidden items. Its a great experience but different than the type of games you mentioned. Try to ignore the people telling you how easy everything is. The thing is the boss i got stuck on might be different than the one you find difficult. Just go for it and enjoy:-)"
158,"I‚Äôve never played cuphead so I don‚Äôt know. From what I can tell they‚Äôre very different games. However, Dark Souls isn‚Äôt as hard as people tend to say. There‚Äôs just a big learning curve, but once you get a feel for it it‚Äôs not bad. I would compare it to playing an old Megaman game or something. At first it seems impossible, but as you get to know the levels and such it becomes easier and you start dying less."
159,"Cuphead is pretty easy.   
I didn't even finish Nioh or any of the Dark Games to be honest.

Might be a 2D versus 3D thing..."
160,Darksouls is not a massively hard game it‚Äôs challenging and requires you to think like all games should journalists just scream and shit themselves if a games harder than press A to win so it‚Äôs been blown wildly out of proportion.
161,Well I beat dark souls and quit cuphead so you should be fine
162,So basically the same approach you take to cuphead but with an added dimension
163,"yep, basically"
164,"It's not really three dimensional, even. Jumping isn't used in combat."
165,"Looks amazing, which game?"
166,Cat will now 'help' you aim.
167,I thought lightgun games only worked on CRT or Tube televisions?! I know that‚Äôs the case with the NES zapper at least...
168,Voyage of the Dead!
169,"He's very ""helpful"""
170,"Sounds like you might have a buggered PSU. It won‚Äôt be a Windows problem if it can‚Äôt even get close to starting Windows.

171,"Ayy! My last PC had this issue! Could be your power supply, could be your motherboard!

175,Those Mass Effect teammates were dumb. 5 seconds into combat they were always down for the count.
176,Great game! Really great game! I was disappointed that the third one wasn‚Äôt done in the same style. I prefer the original engine.

182,I'd have preferred the whole thing to be like the flashbacks to Jersey
183,I‚Äôve never played another game that nails the Hong Kong style heroic bloodshed genre so well! Bullet time and bullet dodge never get old!

193,"Brill! Thanks for the tip, I‚Äôll try there."
194,Purses though. Women literally get to carry a giant bundle of pockets on their shoulder.
195,Ah yes the boys pockets have bombs
196,They get two big chest pockets
197,"And it's a mystery wonderland. Never go into a woman's purse. If she says ""in my purse"" bring her the whole thing... It's a sacred land, and you'll never find it anyway."
198,"Yes true, but maybe I just want to go somewhere without having to carry an extra bag everywhere... My ex-bf could fit both our Switches into a single pocket while I couldn't even have my keys without a bag."

208,"And we want all digital because?.........

I get the convenience of no physical storage, but if you guys really want to do heavy graphics or other filler stuff people sometimes don't care about, i'd like a lite version that has LESS extras so i can still play my game and not take up most of my hard drive.

Or try to find another form of physical media to help with both storage problems? (Not likely...... full digital DOES eliminate the used games market which means more money in company's pockets.)"

all i can think of at the moment"
267,Ooh~
268,Well if you actually get to kill other players then it‚Äôs fun.
269,Does it seriously bother you that other ppl like to play different things?
270,"Yeah, I don't get it either. I miss the old school deathmatch type of games with instant respawning."
271,Cos other people enjoy playing it...
272,"I think I enjoy them mainly just because it is something different from what I normally play. I dont play every day. Sometimes I dont play for months. But it nice to play every once in a while if you dont take it super seriously.

Edit: side note I feel like teammates work alot better together in like apex legends then they do in most multiplayer. It is hard to survive alone doing it with teammates is easier so it benefits you to work together."
273,"People enjoy different things. Things you find fun, there will always be people who find it boring."
274,"I think the fps genre was a little stale, we needed a mix up and battle royals actually fit that need quite well."
275,"Im actually not enjoying normal mp compared to battle royale

At least i only die once per game

Im crap at both but its always better with friends"
276,"Most fps players are campers and cowards. This is why we moved from fast paced arena shooters like Quake and Unreal into this crap once player base broadened.

And there is no better game for campers and cowards than battle royale. You don't move very often. You don't need friends or cooperation. You always sit and camp behind something. And you are not rewarded for combat except the very end. And even at the end everyone try to wait out the opposition.

So it's a perfect game for most people out there."
277,I guess you never get that chicken dinner.
278,"Some people have ADD, some people don't. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I personally love BR games. You gotta drop and find a gun quick before the players around you find one, then you have to kill all those players, then you have to load up and navigate to the circle without dying, etc etc. Idk, being the last person/team out of 100+ players is pretty cool. There's a certain set of skills that are required outside of the prerequisites like having good aim. It's not a mindless shoot em up, there's some planning and situational awareness involved. Also a good team chemistry is critical."
279,"It's not really for me unless I play with friends. If i had to guess, it's because it's different from things made over the previous decade and it gets the adrenaline going when the number of people remaining dwindles down."
280,Battle Royalle is just a standard elimination deathmatch modified to hold more players.
281,"I'm not big on FPS games or BR type games. Just killing repeatedly gets boring and BR games are just FPS with a twist.

But everyone has their own taste so whatever. Let the people game."
282,Its fun to keep dying and piss off my team mates who have to run across the map to revive me.
283,">only to be killed without even knowing what happened

they enjoy it because not everyone is as bad as you"
284,Until you die and your friends keep playing without you and then you can keep watching them or stop playing because you feel left out.. I know that feeling.
285,"I used to camp a lot but guess what it gets boring fast, yes you get many kills but after awhile it isn't fun anymore and you just want to take an smg and start running around."
286,Sounds like legendary gameplay.
287,I may not be good but outta the 100 people only 1 will win.
288,They can still revive and or win
289,That's a late stage. After that you quit battle royale because you realize that arena shooters give you exactly that. Constantly. Without downtime.
290,It really is
291,Every game with winners has only 1 winning player or team.
292,"That's not how it works.. in battle royale only one player really wins, in games like COD or BF  either your team wins or not it's all about the score."
293,"In Battle Royalle games, only one player or team wins (Some BR games do have teams)

In games like COD or BF, only one team wins. 

What is the difference?"
294,Operation Flashpoint?
295,Splinter cell ?
296,sounds like splinter cell
297,Was it a rainbow six game?
298,Ghost recon advanced war fighter? It fits the description.
299,"Sounds like an early Ghost Recon game to me...before Advanced Warfighter...where the series went wrong the first time, IMO."
300,Sniper or something?
301,"No, but that looks solid."
302,"No. More long range, tactical, less stealth."
303,"No. It was more tactical and less stealth. 

Those a great games to play when you can‚Äôt have Metal Gear though."
304,"If Tom Clancy, maybe Splinter Cell."
305,"I mean it‚Äôs almost unfair to compare them, it‚Äôs like saying what‚Äôs better the original Super Mario Bros or Uncharted 4."
306,SMB3 this isn't even a question.
307,"But, in the end, what game do you think is better between Mario 3 and Shovel Knight."
308,Shovel knight
309,"And how would you rate, from 0 to 10,  both Shovel Knight and Mario 3? Both are fantastic, distinctive and unique pinnacles of 2D platforming. Did you also vote in the strawpoll? Please, don't forget to vote. Sorry if I'm being annoying."
310,"My favorite is INCONSISTENT cutscene graphics/cinematic trailers.

FF7 on PS1:

Intro: ""Oooo, pretty.""

Gameplay: ""Blocky.""

Random Cutscene #1: ""Blocky.""

Random Cutscene #2: ""Blocky, some details.""

Random Cutscene #3: ""Beautiful background, blocky characters on top.""

Random Cutscene #4: ""Holy crap, graphic artist showing off super details and amazing animation!""


PICK ONE. >.<"

313,"Even more so when an ad just steals game play footage from a AAA game and passes it off as their game.

Edit: your cinematic drawing is heckin dope."
314,"Oh Diablo, I love those games!"
315,"I've never been much of a mobile gamer, but, forget everything you think you know about mobile games because Raid Shadow Legends is one of the most ambitious RPG projects of 2019 has just been released and will change everything. Just look at the level of detail of these characters! If you use the code in the description you can start with 50,000 silver and join the Special Launch Tournament, and you better hurry because it's getting big fast! You can play for totally free with the link below on your smartphone."
316,All too familiar with this shit at /r/shittymobilegameads
317,[My experience with pretty much every mobile game](https://i.imgur.com/szXYbaP.png)
318,"Every single mobile ad is either stolen from another game, or just faked with 90% of the budget the company had"
319,That's how mafia works
320,Pro tip: Stick them red squiggly boys in a row. If you line up 3 or more you get at least 500 points.
321,"Haha very nice... 

BUT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS GREAT GAME CALLED RAID SHADOW *shots in the distance*"
322,Brought to you by RAID: Shadow Legends
323,the equivalent of seeing someone on Instagram and meeting them irl.
324,iF YoU GEt 90% YOuR LegALlY SkILLed!
325,"That snake reminds me of The Darkness where a guy has two big ass snakes on his back that can rip people apart, kinda fitting to your gory comics lel"
326,Good eye.
327,Watching a WoW trailer or expansion trailer vs. Playing the game.
328,We should be grateful it also applied to Mega Man.
329,"Aw shit Fresh comic off the digital print! 

Level 5 monsters be like that in mmo"
330,And AAA games DLC trailers
331,*cough cough* GTA online *cough cough*
332,"The fake gameplay ads are horrible, too. 

""Can you save the princess??? Only the top 1% can pass this level!!!""

Actual game: Hero Wars / Homescapes"
333,Hit the gym. Then your character will be strong.
334,This is pretty much how I looked playing with transformers action figures as a kid
335,It like E3 game trailers
336,The top comic almost looks playful and less 'let's slay the monsters'.
337,Especially strange when you got your custom character wearing a mishmash of armors in the cinematic cutscene.
338,"It's the advertisements man.

 They don't even show you the game you're acctually going to be playing, just some weird imagining of that game.

Whoever thought it would be a stellar idea to advertise a game that looks better in the preview than the actual game is laughing right now, and most likely rolling In that sweet sweet mobile money."
339,"And they never showcase the 100 in game currencies, half of which are paid or require 5000 hours of gameplay to get one unit."
340,"""Amazing and innovative gameplay!"" Autoplay feature."
341,"When you click on an ad like that, you are ordering well-cooked steak. You shouldn't be expected to enjoy it when the game serves you hot dogs."
342,Sometimes the ads in mobile games are ENTIRELY DIFFERENT GAMES BEING PLAYED than the actual game you are eventually downloading.
343,Ah reality is often dissapointing.
344,"*looks that this was post in gaming*
Oh time to sort by controversial to see assholes"
345,"Even Grafo is endorsing Raid: Shawdow Legends the new epic Mobile game everyone is playing. Did I mention you get a free powerful legend if you use promo code ""Edit"""
346,Don't forget the gameplay in the cinematic that isn't even in the game
347,*cough cough* league of legends *cough*
348,"Holy damn I knew you were an amazing artist but that too one is amazing, I can just see the effort"
349,Holy shit that top picture. Do you also have a way to follow more detailed pieces of yours like that?
350,Fantastic art in that first panel. The work you've been doing on RPVoid is incredible too! Thank you!
351,I hate health bars above everyone's heads?!
352,Haven't seen a sr gafo upload in a hot minute. Hope all is well my man
353,Is this another Raid: Shadow Legends ad?
354,"Or, conversely, the monster just stomps you out in one hit"
355,Wait... Mobile games have gameplay now?
356,I feel The Old Republic vibes from that too :D (if we exclude Blizzard)
357,"""Ha ha, Fooled you!""

Stupid cheap devs. >:P"
358,But it really is impressive when the game makes you feel the top panel while looking like the bottom one.
359,Try the lol mobile when is comes out looks fun
360,Those baby gameplay snakes are adorable.
361,"There are a few exceptions. Like Honkai Impacts Ads and cinematics are pretty accurate to the actual gameplay for the most part. Which is pretty surprising for a mobile game.

But yeah, kind of sad when the actual game doesn't live up to the cinematic stuff. Looking at you Dawn of War 3!"
362,"Uh, Mr. /u/SrGrafo, sir.  I have an unrelated question. Is it pronounced ‚ÄúSir Grafo‚Äù or ‚ÄúSe√±or Grafo‚Äù?"
363,I would play as this character
364,Lords mobile anyone
365,"No, you have to pay $4.99 for cutscenes on the mobile version."
366,i cooka da spaghetti
367,RAID: Shadow Legends

372,"I don't mind trailers that are blatantly cinematic, but when they claim it's gameplay that's when I get angry."
373,"SrGrafo,

Is there any way for me to get notifications of your posts? I‚Äôm always too late :I"
374,"True, but have you heard of *RAID: SHADOW LEGENDS?!* THE GRAPHICS ARE LIKE A TRIPLE-A CONSOLE GAME--"
375,Wow he can draw
376,Every mobile game ever
377,"Gotta be honest, I love Raid: Shadow Legends Ads. Edit: missed a word"
378,"I feel like Mobile cinematics are generally : ""Hey solve that stupid ass problem that is so fucking stupid a toddler could do!"""
379,"That top pic, though....that's some beautiful work."
380,"Learned the hard way. Now I only buy games when they're on sale and there's no player base anymore... Ok maybe I can't afford launch prices, but it saves me from getting ripped off!"
381,"This post was made possible by today‚Äôs sponsor, Raid Shadow Legends."
382,"At least it has some gameplay, could be worse."
383,literally every Card game trailer ...
384,Sometimes the trailer is an FPS and the actual game is strategy...!
385,Idk why but it reminds me of Dark Souls
386,Welcome back SrGrafo!
387,The duality of Grafo's drawings
388,SrGrafo flexing that he‚Äôs good at drawing >:(
389,"If anything, the bigger pet peeve for me personally is any trailer that blatantly shows off spoilers. Take Kingdom Hearts III for example.

I feel like showing off important story scenes *unmodified* (even if they‚Äôre shown out of context) is a pretty big no-no."
390,I just hear raid shadow legends
391,Warcraft 3 refunded in a nut shell
392,"I understand why there's a shit-ton of mobile-game ads on YouTube. What I don't understand is the games' ratings of 4.5+ stars.

Then again, people still preorder Blizzard and EA games."
393,"I mean this drawing is nice and all, but have you tried playing RAID Shadow Legends ?"
394,Mobile ads in a nutshell
395,"Could be worse, you could have a one hour cut scene. Looking at you Hideo!!!!!!"
396,Someone felt like flexing their artistic skills today and I love it
397,Cough Raid Shadow Legends Cough
398,This is why I love games like God of War. No games in that game.
399,CLASSIC
400,Almost like the serpent is a staff. A red serpent should shoot fire!
401,"literally any RPG, especially the mobile ones"
402,Except Spider-Man PS4 and God Of War

406,"*Oh wow, a SrGrafo post less than two hours old!!! Aw man, I'd better say something witty so I get a drawing!*

I uh....


..


...s'up?"
407,I see a video game trailer now that's pre-rendered I automatically think it's a mobile game.
408,Currently playing KH3 and the cinematic to gameplay graphics is flawless and beautiful. I was playing Birth By Sleep before that and it's a jarring comparison.
409,"A lot of games have been going to in engine cutscenes, which I'm less a fan of mostly because they just dont look as good as prerendered. During gameplay you're focused on more than  how it looks so you dint notice the minor problems but during cutscenes your whole focus is on the shot so you notice every single clipping problem and shitty texture."
410,Every MMO ever
411,"Yeah, fuck this false advertising up the ass.  I really dislike this."
412,Whenever I‚Äôm in Mobile so I can relate
413,Looking at you SWTOR
414,"The level of detail in the top drawing is awesome, keep it up! :D"
415,This was the story of my childhood. It's amazing how much a simple game cover can change your entire perception of the graphics inside the game... Imagination is a powerful thing
416,SWTOR be like
417,"I've never been able to get into much more than puzzle or card games on my phone.  
The ones I've played the most are Simon Tatham's Puzzles, and Solitaire: Decked Out"
418,I'd still play that bottom frame game...
419,Botw is so good at boss fight transitions.
420,"On console/PC games, the pre-rendered cinematics usually don't hold up to scenes that are being rendered in real time. Probably why rockstar uses actual assets in real time for cutscenes."
421,May be just me but when I played Infinite Warfare I felt the campaign‚Äôs cutscenes looked much better than the actual gameplay
422,WoW
423,"So when does the ad start playing along with loot boxes, gachas, up coming events, current events, new characters announcement, deals in the shop and notification to restarting app for # GB update?"
424,Too true
425,[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYNriatnYkE) always kills me.
426,Art tutorials vs my actual painting
427,Exactly like a sr graffo comic üòÄ
428,Minecraft is the exception.
429,Download Raid shadow...
430,"So in the cinematic, they're lovingly gazing into each other's eyes, but the gameplay has them fighting?  Wow, that is a pretty dramatic difference.  Bait and switch!"
431,I love how most mobile games go with with this route of ads or just say that their game is a pull pin game.
432,"My favourite is when you looking at a game on steam and EVERY single screenshot and video are of cut scenes. 

It doesn't speak well of your game if you're not even confident enough to show us gameplay."
433,This is wow in a nutshell
434,Any Diablo game in a nutshel
435,Woah! The top piece looks fantastic!
436,E3 Trailer vs. Day 1 gameplay footage
437,"Oh mighty u/SrGrafo I seek your wisdom.  
Why do people have to ruin everything?"
438,For just $4.99 you can purchase the *Snake Skinner Summer Pass* and deal double damage to everything that crawls! (In the next update no enemies crawl)
439,Cyberpunk
440,"Or the opposite, when you play an older game and the dusty BinkVideo cutscenes are noticeably worse than the fully-patched game on Ultra setting."
441,I would totally play that mobile game!
442,This post was brought to you by Raid: Shadow Legends
443,"I recently had this happen. Was getting ads for one game that didn't look fun initially but I saw it enough times that I downloaded it. Game involved saving a guy from multiple forms of death with a puzzle type situation.

Then, I downloaded the thing and it was just a Candy Crush clone, which had nothing to do with the ""do the puzzle, save the guy"" aspect. It was literally a polar opposite of what I wanted."
444,Anybody say Raid Shadow Legends? Mafia City?
445,Mobile ads are the ùëæùë∂ùëπùë∫ùëª!!!
446,Reminded me of Kate Upton in that mobile AoE knockoff.
447,The Metal gear franchise basically.
448,Anthem?
449,Ain‚Äôt it the truth
450,Sponsored by: Invasion Darkness Myths
451,The graphics for snake have improved so much!
452,When games spend more on the trailers graphics then the games themselves
453,What about the games with live action cutscenes? Command and conquer says hi.
454,"Have you heard about raid shadow legends,  cause i haven't. And im very curious about it"
455,"  Yup, the cut scene with Cloud on the motorcycle was incredible (by the standards of PS1).  Tifa pushing Cloud on the wheelchair was barely an improvement over the game-play."
456,Or just a game without cutscenes altogether.
457,probably every 3d square rpg has this to some degree. also weird is when some cutscenes are voice acted and others aren't
458,Are you talking about reforged
459,"I prefer the beautiful all over games that don‚Äôt actually pre-render their cutscenes. They just load in the models and have them do the script. MHW did this very well, as an example of a modern game."
460,"They were literally making it up (processes, standards, plugins for primitive 3D rendering programs) as they went along. Different teams improved at different rates, and submitted scenes in different orders. Sure, generally by the final disk the graphics were vastly improved, but like you said, there was a lot of inconsistency along the way and a lot of FMVs.  

They couldn't pick one because every choice they made literally changed the landscape they were working on."
461,"Also, cutscenes that clearly depict a different character design, or weapons that the character doesn't have equipped anymore. Painkiller managed to be even weirder by having some cutscenes happen mostly in completely the wrong levels."
462,This is one of the reasons a lot of people appreciated GTA V. The cutscenes in that game were exactly like when you played the game. There was no difference in visual quality and it was nice.
463,Well that's how ff7 actually was
464,That‚Äôs somethings that‚Äôs bothered me with a lot of final fantasy games lol. Same thing with kingdom hearts.... almost like they have something in common

482,Have you tried BlockuDoku?  Its Tetris with Sudoku rules.  Kinda fun actually.  I have been playing it for like a month.  The one universal complaint is that you can't rotate the blocks and the developer is apparently looking into to implementing it.

494,But those dance moves on the sub though
495,"Ha, I've been playing Trails of Cold Steel recently and while the cut scenes are consistent, whether or not a line is voice acted seems to be completely arbitrary. Like, even in the same scene some lines from the same character will be voiced and others not with no discernable pattern as to why what line is voiced."
496,Honestly I just thought it was a fake ad for this comic
497,"I did so! I even said as such on your Discord, ya goof. (But you aren't looking there right now...)"

565,One day years ago I wanted a Burger King mask but Burger King didn't sell them.  I couldn't find them online either so I started an e-mail campaign.  I wrote Burger King every week for several months asking if they would please start selling burger king masks.  They never responded but about six months into the campaign they started selling them.  I don't know if I did it or if its a weird coincidence but I bought one.  Still have it actually.

597,"Take the games you like and see if you could find a hobby based on that. Fighting games=fitness maybe or a martial art. Racing games=cars, cycling, or maybe even running. Mmorpgs= maybe writing, story telling, but also collecting possibly. It could be reliant on the MMO. PVP= maybe try larping or other sports. 

Video games are pretty much escapist fantasy, with some power fantasy or (things I literally couldn't do or I would die or go to prison. (CS:GO could transition to paintball or lasertag, but i'll be damned if you could find a good transition from Payday or Payday 2. 

Big problem with any hobby is cost. But as someone who plays games, you likely already know that."
598,"It's more to do with the time investment for me. I usually just end up going ""this is shit"" and giving up before I properly get into it. Despite this, I still update my gaming PC, even though I barely play anything, lol."
599,I understand. I love gaming but I feel like I haven't been able to get into as many. The last two games I really enjoyed were sekiro and God of war 4. It seems most things I try to play my attention just isn't there. And now I've picked up a car part addiction lol.

658,"Set aside time in the weekends or whenever you're free. Maybe ask your girlfriend if you can spend more time with her on a saturday or sunday so you then use the other day to have more uninterrupted gaming time.

Basically reshuffle it. Sounds like right now your schedule is fairly chaotic."
659,"It sounds like it's not even a question of gaming to me. It sounds more like you need time for yourself to relax and unwind.

I've had talks with my fiance about me and games. I'm one that essentially recharges when I'm alone by myself. So what I did is I spoke to her about it and set aside days where I won't touch games at all and I just spend time with her. I also do the same for myself, where I just come home and speak to her for a rather small amount of time and I go play for a few hours usually. She doesn't like it but she understands and respects my need for my alone time away from people. She's still in the other room, so she's mostly okay with it!

I think you just need to sit down with her and talk to her about it. If she's right for you, then she should understand. She may not like it, but people need their own time to unwind and relax. It's very important for ones mental health."
660,"It might help to physically create a weekly/monthly schedule of everything you have going on in your life. That way, you can figure out your free time and how to balance it between the time you spend/talk with your gf and your personal hobbies."

If so, maybe instead of playing games, you may find interesting watch someone else playing them, like a youtuber or a streamer. I know, watching isn't the same as playing yourself, but if you don't have free time, what else you could do? You will get to know the story of those games, you will have a ""virtual partner"" who also enjoy and talk about those games and gaming in general, and thanks to that stopping some stress... Idk, that sounds like killing various problems with just one bullet"

663,"It only gets worse once you have kids.  I'm lucky if a I get an hour a day.  I used to be able to game whilst she napped on me but the light from the TV bothers her now...

>I don‚Äôt have many people that understand my enjoyment of video games.

This bugs me a lot.  My hubby and I are gamers, me more so than him in fact.  But we still occasionally hear about how videogames are immature despite the quantity of titles which are rated 18+, or that they're pointless/stupid, to which I can't help but think: ""Really Karen? You're watching Gordie Shore* but my hobby is stupid?"" Videogames increase cognitive function (puzzle solving, reflexes, leadership skills, memory, etc.) whilst most TV shows do not. 

*insert reality show of choice

>To them I‚Äôm just irresponsible for wanting to play

Everyone needs downtime.  Whether it's getting your nails done, blasting along the road on your motorbike, reading a magazine or playing a computer game: we all need to decompress.  If they really can't understand that your preferred way to de-stress is videogames then there's something wrong with them not you.  

Sounds like you need to plan out your week and readjust your time and priorities. Your family and GF should understand that for two evenings a week you require alone time to do whatever the heck you fancy before you burn out. Suggest your GF hangs with her family/friends that night or see if she'd be willing to try some coop games (A Way Out, Overcooked or pick a Lego game in a franchise she likes)."
664,"I wake up at six and last night I went to sleep at about three in the morning so I could get two or three hours of gaming in. I do things like this a lot to find time, but I‚Äôm always putting something off to play, be it homework or talking/hanging out with someone/or mostly sleep."
665,Yeah. It can be. Especially because we have one car for three people‚Äôs schedules.
666,"Yeah. You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôll try bringing that up, she‚Äôs really nice and I doubt she‚Äôll have any issue with it. I just feel bad asking if I can play games instead of spending time with her."
667,"I don‚Äôt know why but I‚Äôve never liked to make schedules like that. Not even just not like, I actively avoid it. Maybe it‚Äôs time to change that and set time aside for everything."
668,"It‚Äôs a thirty minute drive to work, so not far at all. But from there I work then go to class, then back to work, then, etc. you get it. Not a lot of time to watch games instead of playing, but you‚Äôre right. I should try that when doing homework or something."
669,"Hahaha. Yeaaah. That is something I think about. I‚Äôm busy now, but realistically speaking life won‚Äôt get less busy with time. Welllp, cross that bridge, I guess."
670,"I agree soooo much with all that. I feel like people really see games as this childish thing when it‚Äôs NO DIFFERENT than watching a show for ten hours, except video games are more interactive! But anyway. Yeah. I need to make a schedule. That seems to be the consensus. Thank you. Good luck to you though. I‚Äôm not having kids for a while, but I already know they‚Äôll be ‚Äútime consuming‚Äù(that sounds too negative. I assume you love your kid/s and I will when I wind up having my own)"

705,Ah yes a person of culture as well..
706,How
707,"Personally loving the new modern warfare, I‚Äôve put in hundreds of hours in just a couple months. 

Planetside 2 is about to get an AMAZING new update and might interest you. 

I‚Äôve really, really enjoyed No Man‚Äôs Sky recently. It‚Äôs not a traditional FPS game, but the thing that makes it great is playing with friends. It‚Äôs a whole lot of fun, especially in VR. 

If you‚Äôre looking for some slower paced action games, EVE online is fun if you can get through learning all the menus. There‚Äôs a handful of video guides, and a quick google search will find you in game clans designed to, and full of people willing to help you through anything you want to know. 

For a great story, there‚Äôs the Witcher series of games. Not much I can say about it, I‚Äôve played a ways in and the story seems very rich. 

Finally, and this is the big one. Save up 400 USD, and get a VR headset, if you don‚Äôt typically get very sick doing things like that. I firmly believe that VR is the future of gaming, and we already have games that will likely be classics akin to Half Life. (Boneworks) 

With Half Life Alyx releasing (IIRC next month) it will mark a turning point in gaming, and we will see within 2 years a flood of AAA titles in VR, but until then there‚Äôs so many good games that you can play. I recommend No Mans Sky, Boneworks and Pavlov. 

But of a rant but that‚Äôs about it, I hope I helped provide some games you might want to play."
708,Play the soulsborne series.
709,"Drakengard and Nier series have good soundtracks if you're looking for an extra playlist.

Red Dead Redemption 2 maybe? The writing is solid and the general world building is very well done. The characters are diverse with both likeable and less favorable characters. The soundtrack is also really fitting."
710,"EVE online sounds intresting, sorry but for not specifying, but I'm looking for a game with rich story and likeable characters. Or even cool gameplay"
711,go to the swamps and hunt ducks. simple.
712,More like primitive rust players
713,Minus the fact animals never spawn
714,It's ok. Better than the recent ones. Not as good as the old ones. Unless you are really into cod or desperate for an fps to play go ahead and skip imho.
715,The shooting is great but it‚Äôs just not the same as COD4 and MW2
716,"As someone who's only played till MW2. Id say it's worth it. With season 2 introducing older MW2 maps. I can't complain,it's a CoD game. It get the job done. And to relive the toxic, salty lobbies is 10/10 I would recommend"
717,Best cod I've played. Still has it's issues but if you enjoyed MW1-3 you'll love this one.
718,"Don't take it as Full cod game. it's slower than previous years but more intense. The devs are in top of the game with community support and patches. there are a lot of things to unlock. The operation mode was an after though so don't even try it. The single player is great the multiplayer is good . Not great but is good.  If you can get it between 30 and 40 dollars, buy it."
719,I would say it‚Äôs fast paced like the newer cods but also keeps the more careful playstyles and difficult combat system. I enjoy it but not as much as the old ones.
720,"Meh. Honestly, I'd just wait for the Battle Royale mode if you're into those. It's rumored to be free to play and should be coming out pretty soon."
721,I liked it. But its not really worth the full price. I'd wait for like a christmas price drop or something.
722,It‚Äôs fun except for campers which are abundant but it just doesn‚Äôt hit the same feels as playing the older older cods
723,Last cod game was bo 1 i got this with my 2070 super guess its decent
724,a serious let down compared to mw3
725,Game has horrible spawns it‚Äôs like the game engine has forgot how to play team deathmatch this year.....
726,"it's pretty good, closer in playstyle to mw2 or cod4, but definitely not as good"
727,"My personal favorite CoD is W@W, then MW2 as a close second. So use that to quantify my opinion here:

I think MW2019 is one of the better entries MP wise. Much better than Ghosts and IW (I HATED those). But not nearly as good as W@W or MW2. I would say it is closer to MW3/OPS3 in terms of overall fun/enjoyment in my eyes. Better than Ops4, MW Remaster, and barely better than WW2.

There isn't a shit ton of content, but it fills the gap. 
The story was fun and had some nice themes going. The overall package works, especially if you can get it on sale."
728,The same as the last 10 call of duty games. Filled with campers and killstreaks...
729,Definitely one of the better CoDs with lot of content updates.
730,"Not really worth 175gb disk space yet. Too many broken elements on MP, campaign is really good though."
731,Never even touched call of Duty games.

770,nothing really
771,Nothing at all
772,"Nothing at all, it's still EA behind the game, and the BioWare of Mass Effect and Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is long gone..."
773,More laughs
774,"The whole thing is a shame. This ""redux"" is what should've been the game that already released and now the better version isn't going to be enjoyed as it should've been. I bet only a quarter of the people that bought the game before are going to bother revisiting it. I know I wouldn't go back."
775,I mean I HOPE for a lot. I expect another failure as with all other post release promises made by bioware
776,Expecting a game not in a alpha or beta at best with some interesting content to keep people engaged. And Owen has to be killed off
777,"Story content, missions, etc."
778,Micro-transactions & Pay To Win.
779,Disappointment
780,"I expect, a fresh new price tag.
Bioware died when their vets left it's just EA now."
781,"Do we talk about what needs to be done or what we can expect? Cause the game needs loads of content, item variety and a way better loot spiral."
782,Absolutely nothing.
783,"What they stated the product would be from the get go. 

What they will actually deliver though, is not going to be that. Expecting to be asked to pay for DLC which gives access to the updates."
784,"Idk man
I just play Destiny 2 all the time so I don't really know"
785,F... *Wipes tears* I'm not crying you're crying
786,"True but at the same time, games like EA Battlefront 2, Destiny 2, No Man‚Äôs Sky and FF14: A realm Reborn have GREATLY benefit from a Redux."
787,"Still, think of how much better it would've been if it was completed from the beginning. 

Anyways, did Battlefront 2 and Destiny 2 really have to redux in this capacity or just update? I don't know because I don't have them. 

No Man's Sky I agree with. 

I didn't say the game wouldn't benefit, but it's still not going to be seen by as many and it's a shame."
788,"The problem with this response is that those games actually had some type vision for they wanted, they just needed more development time.

Anthem had no vision outside of ""Live service, looter shooter, iron Man. Yeah"". The story is shit, the world is cool looking for half a second, the gameplay loop is boring af, the loot was terrible... Essentially what I see with this ""redux"" is actually trying to forge a vision for the game."
789,">but it's still not going to be seen by as many and it's a shame.

With how much people spend on microtransactions and loot boxes, I doubt EA and Bioware will care."

One thing is having safe rooms, the other thing is his footsteps are quite inconsistent with where he actually is, and he can teleport around the station, like one time I heard him going from the S.T.A.R.S. hallway through the Lounge into the Library, and then he suddenly opened the Showers door, even though there is absolutely no way how he could get to Showers so quickly from that side of the map. 

He just made me take so many unnecessary detours I constantly rolled my eyes whenever he appeared. I liked his implementation *after* the police station on the 2nd run when he appears in certain moments and starts a chase, but I hated him in the police station."

Unless you mean the controller to the phone, then it is the Sony app for my phone that connects directly (some sony magic).

Unless you mean the game itself, in which using the Playstation app to remote play.

Hope that answered XD"

Which you don't have to buy and are how the game is funded becuase all updates are free.

>  the lack of quests

>  the empty boring world. 

This would mean more if the same wasn't applied to all other FO games."
955,I tried XD

960,F
961,"Yeah, I was a fucking IDIOT and I pre-ordered it. Biggest gaming mistake I've ever made. I played it the week it launched and immediately hated it. Microsoft refused to give me a refund and Bethesda said I was shit out of luck.

I see people post about wanting to play it from time to time and I strongly discourage them because I have come to despise what Bethesda has become."
962,Having a ball?

967,"LOL I have the game still sealed in the package.  The Xbox One X FO76 bundle was actually $100 CHEAPER than the console by itself.

A nice bonus is that the packaging was just a special FO76 sleeve over the standard X1X box.  So I disposed of the sleeve and now nobody has to know I bought Fallout 76 :)"
968,They call him Mr. Farenheit.
969,My bad indeed. Apologies :P
970,"Yeah, you're preaching to the choir. All of those things became obvious on day one and they haven't done a single thing to address it. Todd Howard and his team are a bunch of crooks...

And if I see one more FUCKING re-release of Skyrim for $60.00 I am going to cry."
971,So you didn't even do anything and already decided what you think of the game?
972,"I would have done the exact same thing if it were me though, so apology accepted lol"
973,Says enough about the game don't you think? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
974,"Not really considering you wouldn't even have finished the tutorial yet in an hour. 

23 main quests, 48 side and \~80 miscellaneous and daily quests.  With a big new batch of main, side and miscellaneous coming with Wastelanders in April. 

&#x200B;

And taking the hour statement as exaggerated hyperbole you wouldn't be geared up enough to take on anyone who has been playing a while without getting your ass handed to you.  And even people of similar level if they have friends who play and know the game can give them perk load outs and gear to kick your ass easily.  


I usually run passive mode but if some low level players is being obnoxious I will turn it off and 2 shot kill them with my 3 star legendary Gauss Rifle. 

&#x200B;

And empty world is BS. there are plenty of locations to explore within easy walking distance. Given a big complaint with FO4 was how close everything was them actually addressing this and then getting called an empty world is amusing to me."

It does give an average and makes a distinction between beating the story and doing absolutely everything (gather collectibles for example)"
978,"This seems more for FPS then gaming in general. For example, in MMOs the spam jump means you're ready to go"

1010,"Repost, repost again next week."
1011,"I second the FPS thing. In the Dark Souls games, waving means hello, and bowing means hello and prepare to die."
1012,"I dunno, I also spam jump to get peoples attention. Some MMOs have very in depth emotes, so it's not always needed. but in GW2 it was more common to jump at them, or use showy skills at them to get their attention. 

Side note, I just started playing FFXIV on the trial after playing GW2 for years and I really love the style of everything. The lighting, all the armor, the monsters are all awesome from what I've seen. The world feels a lot more 'real' than gw2 felt for me and i like that. Definitely enjoying it so far."

1085,Recently watched the Did You Know Gaming Video on him. I believe he found the perfect match making between video game and movie story telling. People complain that Death Standing was too boring but I enjoyed it. He constantly test new ways to go beyond fps games.
1086,"Why is the award in a dull matte finish? I thought it was a shiny silver chrome thing which would make it look much more prestigious- like an Oscar. They base should be a glossy color too. 

Those who won it said it was heavy, so that's a good sign. But in this picture they still look like cheap knockoffs."

Edit: yes, I loved metal gear games my entire life. But please someone attempt to explain the plot to any of the games. I‚Äôd love to hear someone differentiate the different Snakes. I guarantee there will be conflicting explanations about who‚Äôs Solid Snake, who‚Äôs liquid snake, who‚Äôs naked snake etc. or how they are even related, for example."

1099,"He's a writer/designer/director so his influence is much stronger than your typical game writers, who usually play an unsung hero role.  Metal Gear was a groundbreaking game and a landmark in the industry, and because Kojima had so much impact on it, the two became synonymous.

Most games are remembered for their gameplay.  Metal Gear is remembered for its writing."
1100,"I don't get the downvotes, he is overrated as shit. The only redeeming character he made was Snake. Mostly because of David Hayter. MGS gameplay was stellar but the writing in them is rage inducting."
1101,"Sure, but I am talking about the looks. I thought it was glossy because that is how I remember seeing it in pictures and video reels. 

No biggie, just surprised. Also, humans like shiny objects. :)"
1102,Please give me an example of some other writers that are posted daily on r/gaming ....
1103,I loved metal gear games and I know him from association with metal gear and death stranding via Reddit. But I wouldn‚Äôt say the writing was my favorite part about metal gear. That‚Äôs the most confusing story ever told. There‚Äôs like 12 snakes and half of them switch sides several times in a single game. Honestly couldn‚Äôt explain any metal gear game to someone even if I tried; despite reading several plot summaries over the years.

1127,Is it a Vault Tec theme?
1128,Came here to say the choice of background is funny since it looks like you are insanely good at drawing Haha. Controller looks sweet tho
1129,A little orange peely on the spray texture but it looks great otherwise. I‚Äôm sure the next one will be smooth as glass.
1130,I truly thought for a second this was hand drawn. Still clean paint job ;)
1131,Very nice!

And I have those same aftermarket aluminum analogue sticks on my DS5. :D"
1133,Looks like a Fallout version!

1135,What kind of paint did you use
1136,"Good job, lad"
1137,I had taken my controller apart last weekend to unjam a sticky Y button. I thought about doing some custom painting. Can you link the guide or list materials that you used for this?

1143,Show this to ur crush and u will get a handjob
1144,What are you going to do to make it not feel sticky?
1145,Why it looks like the controls you can create in xbox design lab
1146,Looks like shit
1147,Did not mean to deceive lol it's not a drawing though. Wish it was...
1148,"He painted on a controller, he didn't paint a 3d image of one."
1149,Haha that's awesome actually. Wish I was that good at drawing. Just some paint though.
1150,Just picked up random colors at the store actually. Once I started I realized they look a bit like the Seahawks colors lol
1151,Was not even thinking of this obviously lol its cracking me up though
1152,"Thank you! Yeah, definitely learned my lesson. Took it as a Bob Ros ""happy accident"". Lol"
1153,"I know, it's been killing me lol should've thought of that. Thank you btw!"
1154,They feel better than anticipated right?
1155,Used some rustoleum enamel
1156,Krylon fusion and rustoleum enamel
1157,"Just use fine grade sandpaper on every surface you want to paint. I used krylon fusion for the blue color and krylon colormaxx for yellow. Was my first time so still not 100% on every decision I made. For instance I personally would use the krylon fusion from now on. Colormaxx seemed not as good. My controller being white, did not need a primer. Keep that in mind also I think. Then finally used rustoleum crystal clear enamel. Couple coats of each btw. Might be a confusing description. Hope this helps!"
1158,Thanks man
1159,Lol Raiders all day...realized the same thing though after my first coat. Knew that color combo looked familiar.
1160,Definitely not bloated. That was my main worry when starting. Was actually surprised that it wasn't bloated. Stop counting my layers!!
1161,Already did. Not a handy in sight.
1162,"I'm sure you could, just wanted to do it myself. Fun project actually."
1163,r/woooosh

1167,Of course keep up the great work
1168,Also it costs like $80 for a custom one so yeah
1169,"Or if he's bored, sand that sucker from 400 to 3000 and use some car polish on it"

1178,Got mine at Best buy. Works fine so far.
1179,"Get something with a 2070 super in it for that pricepoint and likely everything else in the computer should be fine (if its not a ‚Äúsuper‚Äù, get a 2080). Should have atleast a ryzen 5 or i5 (ryzen 3 or i3 at that pricepoint is a bit low) and id HIGHLY recommend an SSD, even if just a small one for booting. 

I know you dont want to build your own, but if the one youre buying doesnt come with an SSD id buy one and install it in addition to the harderive it comes with, should be less then $100 factor that into the price when you buy.

Id start by looking on newegg.com. Also I really do think you can get the specs I mentioned for that pricepoint (2070 SUPER, ryzen 5/i5, small SSD), i probably wouldnt settle for less for that much. May take some shopping around"
1180,Don't buy a Dell or anything that is impossible to upgrade (they use their own plugs and solder cpu to motherboard)
